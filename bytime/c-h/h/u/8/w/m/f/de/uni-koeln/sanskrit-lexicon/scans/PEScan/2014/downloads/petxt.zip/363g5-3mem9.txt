<HI>TIRUNA1VUKKARAS4A(R). He was a S4aivaite like
<>Tirujn5a1nasambandhar (Refer above) and a disciple also
<>of the latter. He was born in the village of Tiruva1mur
<>in South Arcot district. His father was Pugalana1r and
<>mother Madiniya1r both of whom were Vella1las. They
<>got a daughter named Tilakavatiya1r and a son named
<>Marulni1kkiya1r. It was this Marulni1kkiya1r who became
<>famous as Tiruna1vukkara ar. This siddha who acquired
<>divine knowledge has composed 4900 songs in praise
<>of S4iva of which only 312 are in use now. [Page790-b+ 64]
<HI>TI1RTHA. A holy place. Even from very ancient times
<>the people of Bha1rata believed in the sacredness of holy
<>places and they considered a pilgirmage to holy places
<>as a part and parcel of their life. Almost all the Pura1n2as
<>have praised the greatness of holy places.
<NI>It is not true that all those who visit holy places and
<>bathe in the sacred ponds there would get salvation. In
<>Chapter 11 of Padma Pura1n2a it is stated thus:
<NI>He would get salvation whose limbs, mind, knowledge,
<>austerity and fame are under his own control. He who
<>lives clean in body, without egoism, contented and never
<>accepting gifts for services done would get salvation by
<>visiting holy places. He who would fast if he did not
<>get food, whose organs of sense are all under control
<>would get salvation if he visits holy places. He who is
<>righteous, free from anger, treats all animate objects
<>like himself would get salvation if he visits holy place.
<NI>Once the great sage Cyavana told Prahla1da thus: “Only
<>those who are pure in heart would get the benefit of
<>visiting sacred places. It is a sin for others to do pilgrim-
<>age. The banks of Gan3ga1 are crowded with villages
<>and cities. Many types of people like Parayas, Fisher-
<>men, Van3gas, Khasas, Huns and Mlecchas live there.
<>They bathe in the holy river and drink the holy water,
<>but they do not get salvation because their mind and
<>heart are not clean.” (4th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>TI1RTHAKOT2I. A holy place. He who visits this place
<>would attain Vis2n2uloka after obtaining the benefit of
<>doing a Pun2d2ari1ka yajn5a. (S4loka 121, Chapter 84,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>TI1RTHANEMI1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.

<HI>T2IT2T2IBHA. An asura. This demon shines in the court
<>of Varun2a. (S4loka 15, Chapter 9, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>T2IT2T2IBHASARAS. A sacred pond near the a1s4rama of
<>Va1lmi1ki. There is a story about this pond. Once
<>a water-fowl lived there with his mate. One day
<>the male fowl went out for food and as he was
<>returning home he found a few other water-fowls going
<>that way and the male fowl suspected the chastity of his
<>wife. The male fowl decided to abandon his mate and
<>the innocent shefowl prayed to the As2t2adikpa1lakas for
<>help. The As2t2adikpa1lakas instantly appeared there and
<>made a pond and said that if the she-fowl could reach
<>from one shore to the other without getting herself
<>drowned she must be treated as chaste. The she-fowl
<>was accordingly put into the waters and asked to swim
<>to the other shore which she did without any accident.
<>From that day onwards the pon2d was called T2it2t2ibha-
<>saras. (Tit2t2ibha = water fowl. Saras = pond).
<NI>When Si1ta1 came to the a1s4rama of Va1lmi1ki after being
<>abandoned by S4ri1 Ra1ma, Va1lmi1ki wanted to test her
<>chastity. So the sages asked Si1ta1 to enter the pond and
<>reach the other shore. “Oh goddess of Earth, if even in [Page791-a+ 64]
<>my dreams no other person than my husband has
<>entered my thoughts, let me reach the other shore safe.”
<>So saying Si1ta1 entered the water and the goddess of
<>Earth placed her in her lap and took her to the other
<>shore. Si1ta1 did not get even wet. All the sages called her
<>‘Maha1sa1dhvi1’ meaning supremely chaste woman.

<>ture. A great humorist, Sanskrit scholar and actor, he
<>was minister to Bha1skara Ravi Varma1 who was ruler
<>of Kerala during the period from 978 to 1027 A.D.
<>According to Kodun3gallur Kun5jikkuttan Tampura1n, a
<>great Sanskrit scholar and poet, Tola was born in
<>Kondolin5n5a1ru in the village of Aira1n2ikkulam near Ad2u1r
<>in Cochin in a Nambu1diri family. His original name
<>was Ni1lakan2t2ha. When he was a young man, he was
<>ostracised from his community for having had illicit
<>connections with a low-caste servant-maid named
<>Cakki1. He was wearing then a deerskin belt (Tol) on
<>his body as the usual mark of Brahmaca1rins (bachelors)
<>and he threw it away of his own accord earning for him
<>the name Tola. There is another version that Tola is
<>the decayed form of ‘Atula’ meaning matchless. He
<>was mainly interested in writing funny ridicules. There
<>are many such poems now available believed to be
<>those of Tola.
<HI>TOMARA. A place of habitation situated on the north-
<>east part of Bha1rata. (S4loka 69, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma

<>the Pa1n2d2avas beggars by defeating them in a false game
<>of dice. Dhr2tara1 t2ra stood as an accomplice to that.
<>To play the game Dhr2tara1s2t2ra constructed a palace
<>and that palace was called Toran2asph t2ika.
<NI>That diamond-studded palace had a thousand pillars and
<>a hundred entrances. It had crystal fortresses and
<>golden thrones in all the chambers. This palace was
<>called Dyu1tabhavana also. (Chapter 56, Sabha1 Parva).

<>There are several references in the Maha1bha1rata to the
<>Kings of Trigarta. The following are a few of them
<>worth noticing:--
<NI>(i) The Pa1n2d2avas passed through the country of
<>Trigarta while they were wandering in the forests after
<>the fire accident at the waxpalace. (S4loka 2, Chapter

<NI>(iii) Nakula once conquered the country of Trigarta.
<>(S4loka 7, Chapter 32, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iv) The Kings of Trigarta used to pay tribute to

<NI>(v) A King of Trigarta once killed the horses tied to

<>suicide. (S4loka 12, Chapter 271, Vana Parva).
<NI>(vi) A King of Trigarta named Suratha was slain by
<>Nakula. (S4loka 18, Chapter 271, Vana Parva).
<NI>(vii) Sus4arma1, King of Trigarta with his army joined
<>the Kaurava side and carried away the cattle of the
<>King of Vira1t2a and also fought with him. Arjuna
<>during his stay incognito at the palace of the King of
<>Vira1t2a killed many Trigartas. (Chapter 32, Vira1t2a

<NI>(viii) Sus4arma1, King of Trigarta, took the King of

<>about to kill Sus4arma1 when Arjuna intervened and
<>stopped him from that. (Chapter 23, Vira1t2a Parva).
<NI>(ix) Satyaratha, King of Trigarta, had four brothers
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas fought against all the five. (S4loka 9,
<>Chapter 166, Udyoga Parva).
<NI>(x) In the Garud2a-vyu1ha constructed by Bhi1s2ma

<>to the Trigartas. (Chapter 74, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(xvi) The Kings of Trigarta live in the court of Yama.
<>(S4loka 20, Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>TRIJAT2A (GA1RGYA). A sage. Though he was a sage
<>he lived by farming. He had a wife and children and
<>his earnings from farm work were insufficient to make
<>both ends meet. They were living in poverty and it [Page792-b+ 65]
<>was at that time that Ra1ma started for his life in exile
<>in the forests. Before he commenced his journey to
<>the forests he gave immense wealth to all the Brahmins
<>who had assembled around him. At that time Trijat2a
<>never knew about it and when it came to the ears of
<>Trijat2a's wife she ran to the fields and persuaded
<>Trijat2a to go and see S4ri1 Ra1ma. When Trijat2a came to
<>the scene, Ra1ma had almost finished his distribution,
<>but Trijat2a took courage and pushing forward through
<>the crowd approached Ra1ma and said “Oh, famous
<>King, I am a poor man with many children. Give
<>something for this poor man who lives by farming.”
<NI>Hearing this, S4ri1 Ra1ma giving him a small stick asked
<>him to throw the stick into the midst of the cattle
<>grazing nearby. The Brahmin tightening his clothes
<>and getting ready threw the stick with all his might
<>to the south. The stick fell beyond a lakh of cattle
<>grazing there. S4ri1 Ra1ma gave him all the cattle which
<>stood inside the area covered by the stick. (Chapter
<>32, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>Trijat2a was the son of Vis4va1mitra. (S4loka 55, Chapter
<>4, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>TRIJAT2A1. A servant demoness of the palace of Ra1van2a.
<>Trijat2a1 was one among the demonesses who were deput-
<>ed to entice Si1ta1, sitting dejected under the As4oka
<>tree, to the side of Ra1van2a. All the demonesses siept
<>around Si1ta1. Trijat2a1 had a dream one night which is
<>described in Chapter 27 of Sundara Ka1n2d2a thus:
<>“S4ri1 Ra1ma dressed in pure white robes and accom-
<>panied by Laks2man2a dropped to the place from air in
<>a chariot built with ivory and drawn by a thousand
<>swans. After that they came to Si1ta1 on the back of
<>Aira1vata. S4ri1 Ra1ma1 took Si1ta1 in his lap and rose up
<>into the air. They went high to reach the Sun and
<>Si1ta1 was seen patting on the Sun and the moon. Then
<>Aira1vata which was carrying Ra1ma, Si1ta1 and
<>Laks2man2a came to the top of Lan3ka1. Then they came
<>to this place in chariot. Then they travelled to the
<>north in a Pus2paka vima1na. Ra1van2a with oil smeared
<>on his body and looking all red was lying on the
<>ground. His head was clean shaven. He was drinking
<>oil from a pot and was shouting loudly. Then Ra1van2a
<>went to the south on the back of a donkey. When
<>he had travelled a short distance he fell from the
<>donkey head downwards. Rising from there he was
<>muttering many vulgar words. Then Ra1van2a sank
<>into a foul-smelling dung-mire. A black woman
<>wearing a red saree and mud smeared all over her
<>body came near him and dragged him to the south.
<>Kumbhakarn2a also was subjected to her torture. All
<>the members of Ra1van2a's family were seen smeared
<>with oil. After that they all travelled south again.
<>At that time Ra1van2a was seen on the back of a hog,
<>Kumbhakarn2a on the back of a camel and Indrajit
<>on the back of a crocodile. Vibhi1s2an2a alone was seen
<>standing near the Pus2paka Vima1na on the back of
<>a four-tusked elephant wearing white robes and
<>white garlands and sweet-smelling pastes smeared all
<>over his body and holding a white umbrella with the
<>four ministers by his side and the royal band playing.
<>At that stage the beautiful city of Lan3ka1 with its whole
<>army fell into the ocean. Then a monkey messenger
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma burnt the city of Lan3ka1. All the women
<>demonesses and Kumbhakarn2a were seen lying in a cow-
<>dung pit wearing red dress.” [Page793-a+ 64]
<>When Trijat2a1 repeated her dream to her companions
<>all were frightened to death. After the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a,
<>battle, it is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, that S4ri1
<>Ra1ma gave presents to Trijat2a1. (S4loka 41, Chapter 291,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>TRIKAKUBDHA1MA1. A synonym of Maha1vis2n2u. (S4loka
<>20, Chapter 140, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>TRIKU1T2A. A mountain. There are twenty mountains
<>on the four sides of Maha1meru including Triku1t2a.
<>Pura1n2as say that the city of Lan3ka1, the abode of
<>Ra1van2a, was at the top of Triku1t2a. Maha1meru is at the
<>north of Bha1rata. Lan3ka1 is to the south of Bha1rata.
<>Then how is it possible for Lan3ka1 to be on the top of
<>Triku1t2a?
<NI>There is a story to substantiate this belief. Once there
<>arose a quarrel between Va1suki and Va1yubhagava1n
<>and they decided to find out who between the two was
<>more powerful. Va1suki went and lay wound round
<>Maha1meru so tightly that even Va1yu (air) could not
<>enter it. Va1yu got enraged and broke into a cyclone
<>shaking the whole world. Even Maha1meru began to
<>shake but Va1suki lay unaffected. The Cyclone began to
<>increase in vigour and the devas were frightened and
<>they went to Maha1vis2n2u accompanied by S4iva and
<>Brahma1. After hearing their story Vis2n2u called Va1suki
<>and Va1yu to his side and commanded them to stop the
<>quarrel. Va1suki then unwound a part of his winding
<>and that was from Triku1t2a. At once Va1yu entered
<>there and separating Triku1t2a from other parts carried
<>it away and dropped it in the southern sea. It fell to
<>the south of the southern end of Bha1rata. Lan3ka1 is the
<>city built on it by the celebrated architect,
<>Vis4vakarman.
<HI>TRILOKI1TILAKA. A Yoges4vari1 mantra. If one mutters
<>this mantra (a sacred prayer addressed to a deity) one
<>hundred and one times daily, one will become omnis-
<>cient. Not only that, he would be able to move about
<>to any place he wants. The mantra is this: “Hri1m3
<>Gauri1, Rudramayi1 te yoges4vari hum phat2 Sva1ha1” (6th
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>TRINETRA. A minister of Mahis2a1sura. The cabinet of
<>Mahis2a1sura was extremely strong and brilliant. Ciks2ura,
<>virile and an expert in military science, was the Defence
<>minister. The great economist, Ta1mra, was the minister
<>for finance. Udarka was the Commander-in-Chief and
<>the three advisory members were Ba1s2kala, Trinetra and
<>Ka1labandhaka. S4ukra1ca1rya was the minister for edu-
<>cation. (5th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>TRIPA1DA. A demon. In the battle between the demons
<>and the devas Subrahman2ya slew this demon. (S4loka
<>75, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>TRIPURA. A phantom city built by Maya.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Kas4yapa Mahars2i son of Mari1ci and grand-
<>son of Brahma1 had many wives. Of them Aditi got the
<>first place and Diti the second place. Both of them were
<>daughters of Daks2a Devas were born of Aditi and the
<>asuras were born of Diti. Armies of asuras under the
<>leadership of S4u1rapadma, Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura,
<>Gomukha, Hiran2ya1ks2a, and Hiran2yakas4ipu gave immense
<>trouble to the devas. The devas joined together under
<>the leadership of Indra and fought the asuras. The
<>nectar received from the ocean of Milk always made
<>the devas the conquerors. When Subrahman2ya slew
<>Ta1raka1sura the asuras became very weak. [Page793-b+ 65]
<>At this stage Kamala1ks2a, Ta1raka1ks2a and Vidyunma1li1,
<>sons of Ta1raka1sura, did severe penance and made Brahma1
<>appear before them. They demanded a boon that they
<>would never be killed by anybody in any of the three
<>worlds. Brahma1 told them to ask any boon other than
<>that. Then they said: “Great Lord, we must live in
<>three cities and then roam about freely in the three
<>worlds by your grace. Every thousand years all the
<>three of us should join together at a place with our
<>cities. After that meeting, we should separate and roam
<>about freely for another thousand years. If at all there
<>is death for us, it should occur only when we three
<>are together and that also by one arrow.” Brahma1
<>granted the boon and disappeared.
<NI>The asuras then approached Maya and asked him to
<>construct three separate cities for them. Maya built
<>three wonderful cities. One was with gold, another
<>with silver and the third with iron. Ta1raka1ks2a took
<>the golden one, Kamala1ks2a took the silver one and
<>Vidyunma1li1 took the iron one. The asuras started
<>living in these cities. The three puras were respectively
<>in Svarga, A1ka1s4a and the Earth. But each city had the
<>power to travel to any other place at will. The power
<>of controlling these cities was given to Ba1n2a. Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu's son was Prahla1da. Prahla1da's son was Viro-
<>cana. Maha1bali was Virocana's son and Ba1n2a was
<>Maha1bali's son (Chapter 14, Padma Pura1n2a). All these
<>three cities together were named Tripura.
<NI>2) {%Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 Va1pi1.%} (The life giving tank). Even
<>with the existence of Tripura the asuras began to die in
<>numbers and the Tripuras thought of a way to escape
<>from this calamity. Hari, son of Ta1raka1sura, did penance
<>and made Brahma1 appear before him in person.
<>According to a request from Hari Brahma1 made Maya
<>build a tank wonderful in nature. Brahma1 filled the
<>tank with nectar. If any asura died, it was enough if he
<>was dipped in the tank and the dead asura would soon
<>come to life with added strength and vigour. Asuras
<>became immortal since this and the Tripuras started
<>teasing the devas and men with increased ferocity.
<NI>3) {%Consultation with S4iva.%} The aggrieved devas approach-
<>ed Brahma1 and finding him incapable of helping took
<>him to S4iva. S4iva heard everything and assured them
<>that he would kill them when they next met together at
<>the end of a thousand years.
<NI>4) {%S4iva makes preparations.%} As a first step to the slaughter
<>of the Tripuras, S4iva sent Na1rada to Tripura. Na1rada
<>by his unusual spiritual powers made the asura women
<>feel more and more attached to the devas. S4iva at that
<>time thinking about the convenience for a fight with
<>the Tripuras came and settled down on the shores of
<>the river Narmada1. That was how Narmada1 became
<>a holy river. (Chapter 13, Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>S4iva had to make grand preparations for a fight with
<>the Tripuras. He invoked half the strength of the devas
<>to himself to make S4ivas4akti (Javelin of S4iva) greater
<>than Asuras4akti. The devas made Vis4vakarma1 construct
<>a special chariot for S4iva. On the banks of the river
<>Narmada1 at a place which became renowned as
<>Mahes4vara S4iva stayed for a thousand years thinking
<>about the fight with the Tripuras. He made the mount-
<>ain of Mandara his bow, Va1suki, the string and
<>Vis2n2u his arrow. He installed Agni at the tip and Va1yu
<>at the bottom of the arrow. Four devas stood as horses
<>to his chariot. The earth itself was the chariot and all [Page794-a+ 65]
<>the animate and inanimate objects of the devaloka
<>arrayed at different parts of the chariot. On the wheels
<>stood the As4vini1devas and Cakrapa1n2i stayed on the
<>axle. Gandharvas took places on the spokes. Indra
<>stayed on the bow and Vais4ravan2a on the arrow. Yama
<>took his place on the right hand and the dreadful Ka1la
<>on the left hand. Brahma1 acted as the charioteer.
<NI>Equipped thus, S4iva stayed in the godly chariot for a
<>thousand years. When the three cities joined together
<>in the sky S4iva split the cities by his three forked spike.
<>Then he sent an arrow to the cities. Bad omens began
<>to appear in Tripura. People became lifeless in the
<>cities. Soon an arrow from S4iva burnt the cities and
<>the Tripuras were burnt to death. (7th Skandha,

<NI>2) {%Father discards him.%} When Satyavrata grew up he
<>became a lewd, lustful imprudent man. One day while he
<>was leading such a contemptuous life, a marriage was
<>being conducted in a brahmin house. Guests had
<>assembled, the bridegroom had come and the ceremony
<>was about to start when Satyavrata entered the
<>marriage hall and carried away by force the bride to
<>the shock of all those present there. Some of the Brahmin
<>guests immediately went to Trayya1run2a and told him
<>what a shameful crime his son had committed. The enrag-
<>ed father at once sent Satyavrata out from the palace.
<>Satyavrata left the country altogether and went and
<>stayed in a colony of harijans. Though he lived with
<>those low-caste people he did not adopt their mode of
<>living. He went out daily to the forests with his bow
<>and arrow and made his food. He never felt any
<>animosity towards his father who had thus sent him out
<>from his country. He thought thus “Of course, my father
<>got terribly angry when he heard the complaints of the
<>Brahmins and in that mood punished me thus, though
<>the punishment was a bit too much. But our family
<>preceptor Vasis2t2ha, who knows everything, who is a
<>moralist and a righteous man, who has the knowledge
<>and authority to prescribe atonement for all sins, did
<>severe punishment. That was very hard.” As he thought
<>more about it in this vein, he felt a great hatred towards
<>Vasis2t2ha.
<NI>3) {%Satyavrata and Vis4va1mitra's family.%} When his only
<>son Satyavrata was turned out from the family, King
<>Trayya1run2a was greatly distressed. He went to the [Page794-b+ 64]
<>forests to do penance to get another son. At that time
<>the country did not have rains for twelve successive
<>years as a punishment for the King for sending out his
<>son. The people suffered much. Among the people who
<>were suffering were the wife and children of Vis4va1mitra.
<>Vis4va1mitra at that time had gone to the shores of river
<>Kaus4iki1 for doing penance. Vis4va1mitra's family consist-
<>ing of his wife and three sons during that famine lived
<>in hunger. At last the mother decided to sell the middle
<>son and buy food with the money received by the sale.
<>She put a rope made of darbha grass round the neck
<>of the boy and took him to the market. On the way
<>Satyavrata saw them and on hearing their sad story told
<>them not to sell the child. He assured them that he
<>would take care of them till the return of Vis4va1mitra.
<>He removed the darbha rope from the child's neck and
<>the child got the name of Ga1lava from that time on-
<>wards. (Gala=neck). He promised them he would
<>daily place enough meat at the foot of a tree near the
<>a1s4rama. True to his promise, he hunted in the forests
<>and brought to the foot of the tree fresh flesh of deer or
<>hare or boar and also fresh fruits. The family lived
<>happily because of him.
<NI>4) {%Curse of Vasis2t2ha and the name of Tris4an3ku.%} When
<>Trayya1run2a went to the forests to do penance, it was
<>Vasis2t2ha who was managing the affairs of the palace.
<>The heir-apparent Satyavrata lived in the hut of a
<>can2d2a1la. Every minute Satyavrata's hatred towards
<>Vasis2t2ha increased in strength. One day Satyavrata did
<>not get any game even after a day's hunting and at
<>dusk he happened to reach the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha
<>where he saw Nandini1, the beloved cow of the sage,
<>grazing by the side of the a1s4rama. Anger, desire and
<>hunger made him imprudent and without thinking of
<>the consequences Satyavrata killed Nandini1 and after
<>eating enough to appease his hunger took the rest to
<>feed the family of Vis4va1mitra. The wife of Vis4va1mitra
<>little knowing that it was cow's flesh cooked it and
<>ate it.
<NI>That night when Vasis2t2ha came to the a1s4rama he found
<>Nandini1 missing and he went in search of it. After some
<>time the sage knew that Satyavrata had killed and eaten
<>it. The enraged sage called Satyavrata to his side and
<>cursed him thus “You will from today become a
<>can2d2a1la. Three s4an3kus (sins) namely wrath of a father,
<>abduction of another man's wife and consumption of
<>cow's flesh will give you life-long trouble and thus you
<>will earn a name, Tris4an3ku (Three s4an3kus). Instantly
<>Satyavrata became a can2d2a1la and started roaming
<>about in the streets.
<NI>5) {%Tris4an3ku becomes King.%} Tris4an3ku, distressed at heart
<>by a father's wrath and a Guru's curse walked about
<>aimlessly in the forests. He expressed his desire to the
<>r2s2is and Brahmins to do a ya1ga and get himself absolved
<>of all his sins. But nobody was willing to help a wretch-
<>ed man cursed and abandoned by both his father and
<>his Guru. Feeling desperate, he decided to commit
<>suicide. He made a great fire-pit and prepared himself
<>to jump into it. Before doing that he prayed to the
<>goddess and when the goddess knew that his devotee
<>would jump into the fire and become ashes, she appear-
<>ed before him in person and said thus: “Son, why do
<>you try to jump into the fire? Your father has become
<>old and day after tomorrow he will crown you as King [Page795-a+ 65]
<>and then go to the forests to do penance. Look, there
<>comes your father's minister to take you to the palace.”
<>When the goddess disappeared Satyavrata returned to
<>his a1s4rama in a pensive mood. Na1rada went and in-
<>formed the king of everything that happened in the
<>forest and the king immediately sent his ministers to
<>fetch Satyavrata to the palace. When Satyavrata came
<>the king crowned him as king and then went to the
<>forests for penance.
<NI>6) {%Satyavrata becomes Can2d2a1la again.%} Satyavrata ruled the
<>country for a long time. He was a pious ruler, devoted
<>to god and soon he developed a desire to go to heaven
<>with his mortal body. He approached Vasis2t2ha first
<>for this purpose. But the family preceptor told him
<>there was nothing in the s4a1stras about any ya1ga which
<>could help one to go bodily to heaven. Disappointed
<>he approached the sons of Vasis2t2ha who ridiculed him
<>when he told them of his queer desire. Tris4an3ku got
<>angry and left them saying “Let me see whether there
<>are others in this country who could send me bodily to
<>heaven.” Those arrogant words annoyed Vasis2t2ha and
<>his sons and they cursed him and made him a can2d2a1la
<>again. Tris4an3ku thereafter did not return to the palace,
<>but went to the forests to live there. He knew if he
<>returned to the palace as a can2d2a1la he would not be
<>recognised by his wife and children.
<NI>Haris4candra, son of Tris4an3ku, heard about the curse on
<>his father and sent the ministers to fetch his father to
<>the palace. But Tris4an3ku did not come back and so the
<>ministers made Haris4candra the king of Ayodhya1.
<NI>7) {%Vis4va1mitra meets Tris4an3ku.%} When Haris4candra became
<>king, Tris4an3ku was living in Amba1vana (forest of Amba1)
<>as a great devotee of the goddess. It was at that time
<>that Vis4va1mitra returned home after his penance. Vis4va1-
<>mitra enquired of his wife how they managed to live
<>during the great famine. Then Satyavati1, wife of Vis4va1-
<>mitra, told him the whole story of how Satyavrata helped
<>them, why he killed Nandini1, Vasis2t2ha's cow, and how
<>they ate cow's flesh, how Satyavrata was cursed to be a
<>can2d2a1la, how he was called back as king and how he was
<>at that time living in Amba1vana. The eyes of Vis4va1-
<>mitra1 became wet when he heard the sorrowful story
<>and he decided to end the can2d2a1latva (state of being a
<>can2d2a1la) of Satyavrata. He went straight to Amba1vana
<>and met Tris4an3ku there.
<NI>8) {%Tris4an3ku Svarga (Heaven of Tris4an3ku).%} Vis4va1mitra pro-
<>mised Tris4an3ku that he would send him to heaven bodily
<>and made preparations for a ya1ga. No other sage par-
<>took in the ya1ga because of instructions from Vasis2t2ha.
<>But undaunted, Vis4va1mitra conducted the ya1ga alone
<>and, as the power of his performances increased, Tri-
<>s4an3ku started rising bodily from earth slowly and soon
<>rose up to heaven. When the devas found a Can2d2a1la
<>standing with his physical body before the gates of
<>heaven, they ran to Indra and told him. Indra got
<>angry and pushed him out from heaven and Tris4an3ku
<>came falling down with his head turned downwards to
<>the earth. Tris4an3ku cried loudly calling Vis4va1mitra
<>by name. When Vis4va1mitra, hearing the noise, looked
<>up he saw poor Tris4an3ku descending fast from heaven
<>with his head turned upside down. Vis4va1mitra's anger
<>knew no bounds and he roared aloud “Let Tris4an3ku
<>stay where he is now.” Tris4an3ku stopped in mid-air.
<>Indra did not allow Tris4an3ku to come up and Vis4va1-
<>mitra did not allow him to come down. Indra then made [Page795-b+ 64]
<>a separate heaven for Tris4an3ku below original
<>heaven. Then Vis4va1mitra started to create another Indra
<>and devas for the new heaven. The devas were frightened
<>and Indra then approached Vis4va1mitra and requested
<>him to desist from his attempt to make duplicate devas
<>promising him that he would give Tris4an3ku a seat in
<>his heaven itself. Vis4va1mitra agreed to it. At once
<>Indra brought a golden Vima1na and took him bodily to
<>heaven. (Sargas 57 to 59, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a

<>a messenger of peace, he met S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a on the way.
<>(Chapter 83, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>TRIS4IRAS I. A demon who was a friend of Ra1van2a. The
<>Khara-Du1s2an2a-Tris4iras combination led the attack on
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma in the forest of Dan2d2aka when Laks2man2a cut
<>off the nose and breasts of the demoness S4u1rpan2akha1.
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a killed all the three. Tris4iras was
<>a powerful fighter and S4ri1 Ra1ma's forehead was wounded
<>by an arrow from Tris4iras. The latter came and fought
<>in a chariot drawn by four horses. He was killed by an
<>arrow from Ra1ma. (Sarga 26, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>TRIS4IRAS II (VIS4VARU1PA). Once there was a celebrat-
<>ed Praja1pati of name Tvas2t2a1. Though he was of a pious
<>nature interested in the welfare of Brahmins, he hated
<>Indra. He thought of destroying Indra somehow. With
<>that purpose in view he produced by his wife Recana1,
<>a powerful son and named him Vis4varu1pa. The boy had
<>three heads and so he was called Tris4iras (Tri=Three
<>S4iras--head) also. He could use his three heads for
<>three different purposes at a time. He would drink wine
<>with one head and mutter the Veda-mantras by another
<>head and see the world by the third.
<NI>Even from boyhood he disliked worldly pleasures and,
<>abandoning even food, started to do penance. During
<>the hot season he would sit amidst fire and during the
<>cold season he would sit in water to do penance. He
<>would stand with his head down and do penance. The
<>penance of Tris4iras was so severe that Indra began to
<>get frightened. He sent celestial maidens to stop the
<>penance but all the attempts proved futile before that
<>great ascetic. Then Indra himself riding on Aira1vata
<>went and killed the sage by his Vajra1yudha. Indra
<>feared whether Tris4iras would come to life again and
<>wreak vengeance on him. So he ordered a carpenter
<>standing nearby to bring to him the three heads separat-
<>ed from the body. The carpenter cut off the heads from
<>the body and as each head fell to the ground several
<>kinds of birds were found escaping from it. From the
<>head which used to mutter Vedic mantras rose the
<>Kapin5jala birds; from the head used for drinking wine
<>rose Kalapin3ga birds and from the third rose the Tittiri
<>birds. When the birds thus rose to the air Indra was
<>convinced that Tris4iras was dead and he went away
<>See under Vis4varu1pa. (6th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>1) {%Grandfather of Vis4ravas.%} Vis4ravas, father of Ra1van2a
<>was the son of Ma1nini1, daughter of Tr2n2abindu. There

<NI>Once the sage Pulastya was doing penance in a seclud-
<>ed place in the Hima1layas when a few Deva Gandharva
<>women came to that place and disturbed his penance
<>by their dances and noise. The angered sage gave a
<>curse to that place saying that any woman coming to
<>that place would become pregnant. Ma1nini1, daughter
<>of Tr2n2abindu went to this place unaware of the curse
<>and got pregnant. She came weeping to her father and
<>Tr2n2abindu immediately took his daughter to Pulastya
<>and asked him to marry Ma1nini1. Pulastya married
<>Ma1nini1 and Vis4ravas was born to her.
<NI>2) {%How he cursed Hanu1ma1n.%} Once Hanu1ma1n caught
<>hold of a lion and elephant in fight and tied them
<>each to a post on the two sides of the a1s4rama of
<>Tr2n2abindu. When the sage stepped out from the
<>hermitage, he was for a moment frightened by the sight
<>of two mighty animals on the sides of his a1s4rama and
<>knew by his divine powers that the perpetrator of that
<>deed was Hanu1ma1n and so he cursed him saying that
<>he would lose all his divine powers forthwith.
<>Hanu1ma1n begged for relief and the sage said that he
<>would regain his powers at the time of his going in
<>search of Si1ta1 when another member of his species
<>would remind him of his lost divine powers. Hanu1ma1n
<>remained oblivious of his powers till the time when the
<>monkeys were trying to leap to Lan3ka1 from the
<>Mahendra mountain on the shores of Bha1rata. Ja1mba-
<>va1n, a mighty monkey chief called Hanu1ma1n to his
<>side and made him understand the great powers latent
<>in him. From that moment onwards Hanu1ma1n regained
<>his lost powers and became his old self. (See under

<>Amba1d2i. Tr2n2a1varta, in magic disguise went to the [Page797-a+ 65]
<>house of Nandagopa. Even when he entered the place
<>bad omens were visible. Yas4oda1 was breast-feeding
<>baby Kr2s2n2a keeping the babe in her lap. Soon Yas4oda1
<>felt the babe gaining weight and very soon she felt the
<>weight unbearable and rose up to place the child on a
<>mat on the ground. But even before that Yas4oda1 was
<>fixed to the ground by the weight of the babe. But
<>somehow she placed the babe on a mat on the ground
<>and went out to wash her hands and face. When she
<>came back she could not find the babe on the mat.
<>Tr2n2a1varta had come in the form of whirl-wind and had
<>already carried away the child. But after some time the
<>weight of the babe increased so much that Tr2n2a1varta,
<>unable to carry the weight, wanted to drop the child to
<>the ground. But the child stuck on to his neck and
<>breast tightly and Tr2n2a1varta finding no escape from
<>the tight hold which suffocated him, fell to the ground
<>dead on a hard rock. (10th Skandha, Bha1gavata).

<>broke into six pieces. When he found his mace gone
<>the demon caught hold of Gan2apati and beat him with

<>his weapon (Axe) ‘Ven2mazhu’. The demon fell to the
<>ground in two pieces but still his hold on Gan2apati
<>was not released. Gan2apati tried his best but could not
<>loosen the hold. Then Kun2d2odara, a leader of the

<HI>TULASI1. (Holy Basil plant.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Tulasi1 is a plant held most
<>sacred by the Hindus. There is a Pura1n2ic background for
<>Tulasi1 attaining this spiritualistic importance. In fact
<>it is Maha1laks2mi1, wife of Vis2n2u, who had herself taken
<>the form of Tulasi1. There is a story about it in Devi
<>Bha1gavata.
<NI>2) {%The curse of Sarasvati1.%} Sarasvati1, Gan3ga1 and
<>Laks2mi1 were all, in the beginning, wives of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Lord loved all the three equally. One day all the
<>four were sitting together when Gan3ga1 sent lustful
<>glances at Vis2n2u which was immediately noticed by
<>both Sarasvati1 and Laks2mi1. Sarasvati1 got angry and
<>rising up caught hold of the hair of Gan3ga1 and dragged
<>her to the ground. Laks2mi1 then caught hold of Saras-
<>vati1 to prevent further assault but Sarasvati1 then
<>poured all her rage on Laks2mi1 and cursed her to be
<>born as a plant on earth. Gan3ga1devi1 could not bear
<>this and she cursed Sarasvati1 to be born as a river on
<>earth. Sarasvati1 retorted with a curse that Gan3ga1 also
<>would be born as a river. When the whole tumult was
<>over Vis2n2u called Laks2mi1 to his side and said--“Oh
<>Devi1, do not worry. Things have happened as predes-
<>tined. You go and be born as the daughter of Dharma-
<>dhvaja and grow up there. From there by divine grace
<>you will be transformed into a plant sacred enough to
<>make all the three worlds pure. That plant will be
<>named Tulasi1. When you will be thus living as Tulasi1,
<>a demon named S4an3khacu1d2a with part of my virile
<>strength will be born and he will marry you. Then you
<>can come back to me. The holy river Padma1vati1 will
<>also be another form of your spirit.”
<NI>3) {%The story of Dharmadhvaja.%} Who was this Dharma-
<>dhvaja to whom was born Maha1laks2mi1 as a daughter?
<>In times of old there was a Manu called Daks2asa1varn2i
<>who was extremely virtuous and a part of Vis2n2u. Des-
<>cending from Daks2asa1varn2i were Brahmasa1varn2i-
<>Dharmasa1varn2i-Rudrasa1varn2i-Devasa1varn2i-Indrasa1varn2i
<>Vr2s2adhvaja. This last named was a great devotee of
<>S4iva and because of his great affection for this devotee
<>S4iva lived a whole period of a devayuga in the a1s4rama
<>of Vr2s2adhvaja. King Vr2s2adhvaja by an edict prohibited
<>the worship of any other deity than S4iva in his country.
<>Even the worship of Maha1laks2mi1 ordained by the Vedas
<>during the month of Bha1dra (September) became ex-
<>tinct. All Ya1gas and worship of Vis2n2u came to a stop.
<>Su1rya (Sun-god) got angry at this belittling of other
<>gods than S4iva and cursed the King Vr2s2adhvaja that he
<>would cease to be prosperous. S4iva did not like it and
<>he went to punish Su1rya holding his trident in his
<>hand. Su1rya was frightened and he approached his
<>father Kas4yapa. Kas4yapa and Su1rya went to Brahma1
<>and acquainted him with all details. Brahma1 also was
<>helpless in the matter and so all the three of them went
<>to Maha1vis2n2u. They prostrated before Vis2n2u and told
<>him all. At that time S4iva also came there. Addressing
<>all of them Vis2n2u said “Oh, Devas, within this half an
<>hour twentyone yugas have passed by on the earth. He
<>about whom you have come to speak to me is dead and
<>gone. Even his son Rathadhvaja is dead. The latter
<>has two sons named Dharmadhvaja and Kus4adhvaja.
<>They are dull and splendourless now because of the curse
<>of Su1rya and are now worshipping Laks2mi1.” Saying
<>thus Vis2n2u disappeared. [Page798-a+ 63]
<NI>4) {%Birth of Tulasi1.%} Dharmadhvaja and Kus4adhvaja
<>did penance to propitiate Maha1laks2mi1. Kus4adhvaja
<>had a wife named Ma1la1vati1. She bore a daughter named
<>Vedavati1. Si1ta1, wife of S4ri1 Ra1ma, was a rebirth of this
<>Vedavati1.
<NI>King Dharmadhvaja had a wife named Ma1dhavi1. Maha1-
<>laks2mi1 entered her womb as an embryo and after a hund-
<>red years Ma1dhavi1 gave birth to a daughter. Even at the
<>time of birth the child looked like a matured girl and was
<>extremely pretty. She was therefore, called Tulasi1, meaning
<>matchless. (Tula=match). This Tulasi1 abandoning all
<>worldly pleasures went to Badarika1s4rama and started doing
<>penance there with the prayer that Maha1vis2n2u should
<>become her husband. She did penance for twentyfour
<>thousand years sitting amidst fire in the hot season and
<>sitting in water in the cold season and taking only
<>fruits and water as food. Then she did penance for ano-
<>ther thirtythousand years eating leaves only, another forty
<>thousand years taking air only as food and another ten
<>thousand years without any food. At this stage Brahma1
<>appeared and asked her the object of her Penance. She
<>replied she wanted Maha1vis2n2u to be her husband.
<>Hearing this Brahma1 said thus--“Devi, you know the
<>cowboy Suda1ma1 born of a part of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. That
<>brilliant cowboy has now been born on earth, due to a
<>curse of Ra1dha1, as a demon named S4an3khacu1d2a. He is
<>matchlessly eminent and has once fallen in love with
<>you seeing you at Goloka. You will become his wife and
<>later you can become the wife of Na1ra1yan2a. At that
<>time a part of your divine body will remain on earth as
<>a plant named Tulasi1. Tulasi1 will become the most
<>sacred of all plants, dear to Vis2n2u, and all worship
<>without using Tulasi1 leaves would be ineffective.”
<NI>5) {%Marriage of Tulasi1.%} Due to a curse of Ra1dha1,
<>Suda1ma1, the cowboy, was born on earth as a demon
<>named S4an3khacu1d2a. He did penance sitting at Badarik-
<>a1s4rama and obtained Vis2n2ukavaca. Another object of
<>his was to marry Tulasi1. He obtained a boon from
<>Brahma1 that his death would occur only when the
<>Vis2n2u Kavaca was removed from his body and the
<>chastity of his wife was lost. At that time S4an3khacu1d2a
<>and Tulasi1 met each other in the forests and were
<>married. S4an3khacu1d2a, brilliant and majestic, went
<>about with Tulasi1 in amorous sports creating jealousy
<>even among the devas. His arrogance gave innumer-
<>able troubles to the devas and they along with Brahma1
<>and S4iva approached Maha1vis2n2u for a remedy.
<>Vis2n2u then sent S4iva with his spike to kill S4an3khacu1d2a
<>and he himself started to molest the chastity of his wife
<>Tulasi1. S4an3khacu1da took leave of Tulasi1 to go
<>and fight with S4iva. When Tulasi1 was thus left alone,
<>Maha1vis2n2u in the form of S4an3khacu1d2a approached
<>Tulasi1 and after some preliminary talks entered into
<>sexual acts. Tulasi1 found some difference in the usual
<>sexual methods and suspecting foul play jumped up to
<>curse the impostor. At once Maha1vis2n2u appeared in
<>his true form and said “You have been doing penance
<>for a long time to get me as your husband. Your
<>husband S4an3khacu1d2a was the chief of my Pa1rs2adas,
<>Suda1ma1. It is time for him to go back to Goloka get-
<>ting himself released from the curse. By this time S4iva
<>would have killed him and he would have gone to
<>Goloka as Suda1ma1. You can now abandon your body [Page798-b+ 65]
<>and come with me to Vaikun2t2ha to enjoy life as my
<>wife.
<NI>Your body will decay and become a holy river named
<>Gan2d2aki1; your hair will become Tulasi1 plant the
<>leaves of which will be held sacred in all the three
<>worlds.”
<NI>Tulasi1 then changed herself into the form of Laks2mi1
<>and went to Vaikun2t2ha with Maha1vis2n2u. (9th Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>6) {%The greatness of Tulasi1.%} Everything of the Tulasi1
<>plant, leaves, flowers, fruits, roots, twigs, skin and even
<>the soil around is holy. The soul of a dead one whose
<>dead body is cremated using Tulasi1 twigs for firewood
<>would attain a permanent place in Vis2n2uloka. Even
<>great sinners would be absolved of their sins if their
<>dead bodies are cremated with Tulasi1 twigs. If at the
<>time of death one thinks of God and mutters His name
<>and if his dead body is later cremated with Tulasi1
<>twigs, he would have no rebirths. Even he who has
<>done a crore of sins would attain moks2a if at the time
<>of cremating his dead body a piece of Tulasi1 twig is
<>placed at the bottom of the funeral pyre. Just as all
<>waters become pure by the union with Gan3ga1 water,
<>all firewood is made pure by the addition of a small
<>piece of Tulasi1 twig. If the dead body of one is cre-
<>mated using Tulasi1 twigs alone, one's sins for a crore
<>of Kalpa years would be washed away. Yamadu1tas
<>would keep away from one whose dead body is cre-
<>mated with Tulasi1 twigs and servants of Vis2n2u would
<>come near. If a light is burnt for Vis2n2u with a Tulasi1
<>stick it would be equal to burning several lakhs of
<>lights for Vis2n2u. If one makes the Tulasi1 leaves into a
<>paste and smears it on one's body and then worships
<>Vis2n2u for one day, one would be getting the benefit of
<>a hundred ordinary worships and also the benefit of
<>doing a hundred goda1nas. (gifts of cows). (Chapter 24,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>TUMBURU I. A Deva Gandharva. He was the best
<>musician among the Gandharvas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Tumburu was the son of Kas4yapa, son of
<>Mari1ci and grandson of Brahma1, born of his wife
<>Pradha1. Of the sons of Kas4yapa the four Gandharva
<>sons, Tumburu, Ba1hu, Ha1ha1 and Hu1hu1 were noted for
<>their sweet and pleasant conversation.
<NI>2) {%Tumburu and the Pa1n2d2avas.%} Maha1bha1rata states
<>about several occasions when Tumburu has shown a
<>special and deep interest in the Pa1n2d2avas. The follow-
<>ing few are of special mention--
<NI>(i) Tumburu attended the Janmotsava of Arjuna.
<>(S4loka 54, Chapter 122, A1di Parva).
<NI>(ii) Once this Gandharva gave Yudhis2t2hira a hundred
<>horses. (S4loka 24, Chapter 52, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iii) Tumburu welcomed Arjuna when the latter went
<>to Devaloka at the invitation of Indra. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 43, Verse 14).
<NI>(iv) Once when the Pa1n2d2avas were living incognito in
<>the country of Vira1t2a the Kauravas carried away the
<>cattle of the King. Arjuna in disguise then fought
<>against the Kauravas and Tumburu watched the fight
<>with interest. (S4loka 12, Chapter 56, Vira1t2a Parva).
<NI>(v) Tumburu was present at the As4vamedhaya1ga of
<>Yudhis2t2hira. (S4loka 39, Chapter 88, As4vamedha
<>Parva).
<NI>3) {%How Tumburu was born as Vira1dha.%} When Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a were in the forests in exile a demon named [Page799-a+ 64]
<>Vira1dha attacked them. That demon was none other
<>than Tumburu. Once when Tumburu was living in the
<>city of Kubera he committed a sin and Kubera cursed
<>him and made him into a demon. Kubera had then
<>told him that he would get relief from the curse when
<>he was slain by Ra1ma, son of Das4aratha. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>killed Vira1dha and the latter regaining the form of
<>Tumburu left for Gandharvaloka. (See under Vira1dha).
<NI>4) {%How he cursed Puru1ravas.%} It is found in Katha1saritsa1-
<>gara that the temporary separation which Puru1ravas
<>had from Urvas4i1 was due to a curse by the Gandharva
<>Tumburu.
<NI>After marrying Urvas4i1 Puru1ravas once went to Deva-
<>loka at the invitation of Indra. He was invited to help
<>Indra in his fight against the asuras. Indra celebrated
<>the day on which one of the best of the demons, Ma1ya1-
<>dhara was killed. Rambha1 was dancing before a1ca1rya
<>Tumburu on the occasion and Puru1ravas finding fault
<>with her dance mocked at her. Rambha1 felt insulted
<>and asked the King thus: “Fool of a King, what do
<>you know of the divine dances of Devaloka?” Puru1ra-
<>vas retorted that he had learnt more of dancing from
<>Urvas4i1 than what her preceptor Tumburu knew. Tum-
<>buru got angry and cursed Puru1ravas that he would
<>live separated from Urvas4i1 till he did penance to please
<>Maha1vis2n2u. The Gandharvas then carried away
<>Urvas4i1 from Puru1ravas. (See under Puru1ravas).
<NI>5) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Tumburu was a member of the court of Indra.
<>(S4loka 14, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) Tumburu was a member of the court of Kubera.
<>(S4loka 26, Chapter 10, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iii) The songs of Tumburu who was a worshipper of
<>Kubera used to be heard from the mountain of Gan-
<>dhama1dana on the full-moon day. (S4loka 29, Chapter
<>159, Vana Parva).
<HI>TUMBURU II. A sage.
<NI>{%Some details.%}
<NI>(i) This sage was one among the many sages who came
<>from the north to visit S4ri1 Ra1ma on his return to
<>Ayodhya1 after the exile. Those who came from the
<>north were--Kas4yapa, Vasis2t2ha, Atri, Vis4va1mitra,
<>Gautama, Jamadagni, Bharadva1ja, Sanaka1dis, S4ara-
<>bhan3ga, Durva1sas, Matan3ga, Vibha1n2d2aka and Tum-
<>buru. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(ii) Tumburu was one among the r2s2is who visited
<>Bhi1s2ma lying on his bed of arrows. (Chapter 47, S4a1nti
<>Parva).
<HI>TUN2D2A I. A King. The Pa1n2d2avas invited this King to
<>take part in the great Maha1bha1rata battle. (S4loka 21,
<>Chapter 4, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>TUN2D2A II. A demon. This demon who was one among
<>the army of Ra1van2a fought against the monkey leader,
<>Nala, in the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle. (S4loka 9, Chapter
<>285, Vana Parva).
<HI>TUN2D2IKERA. An ancient place of Bha1rata. The people
<>of this place took part in the great Maha1bha1rata battle.
<>(S4loka 20, Chapter 17, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>TUN3GAKA1RAN2YA. A holy place. The sage Sa1rasvata
<>did Devata1dhyayana on behalf of other sages at this
<>place. (S4loka 46, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<HI>TUN3GAVEN2A1. An ancient holy river of Bha1rata. People
<>of Bha1ratae came pure by drinking the water of this
<>river. (S4loka 27, Chapter 6, Bhi1s2ma Parva). [Page799-b+ 64]
<HI>TURI1YA. A state of existence of Man. (See under
<>Ja1grat).
<HI>TURVAS4A. A King extolled in the R2gveda. Narya,
<>Turvas4a and Turvi1ti were contemporaries. (Su1kta 54,
<>Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<HI>TURVASU. A son born to Yaya1ti of his wife Devaya1ni1.
<>Yaya1ti had two wives S4armis2t2ha1 and Devaya1ni1. Of
<>S4armis2t2ha1, Yaya1ti1 had three sons named Druhyu,
<>Anudruhyu and Pu1ru and of Devaya1ni1, two sons named
<>Yadu and Turvasu.
<NI>Once Yaya1ti called all his five sons to his side and ask-
<>ed them if any one of them would be willing to ex-
<>change his youth with his father's old age. All the four
<>refused but Pu1ru agreed to accede to his father's request.
<>Yaya1ti then cursed Turvasu and all the other three.
<>(See under Yaya1ti).
<HI>TURVAYAN2A, A King extolled in the R2gveda.
<>(Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<HI>TURVI1TI I. A King extolled in the R2gveda.
<HI>TURVI1TI II. A King. But since in some places he is
<>mentioned as a sage, it must be presumed that he must
<>have been a King who had become a sannya1sin during
<>the latter part of his life. Once this sage was drowned
<>and Indra came in time and rescued him. (Su1kta 61,
<>Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<HI>TUS2A1RA. A place of habitation of ancient Bha1rata.
<>Scholars are of opinion that the present Tukha1ristan
<>was the ancient Tus2a1ra. The people of this place used
<>to be called Tus2a1ras and their King Tus2a1ra. The King
<>of Tus2a1ra was the store-keeper during the Ra1jasu1yayajn5a
<>of Yudhis2t2hira, (Chapter 51, Vana Parva). The
<>Pa1n2d2avas during their exile crossed this country of
<>Tus2a1ra on their way to Dvaitavana from the mountain
<>of Gandhama1dana. During the great battle, the Tus2a1-
<>ras arrayed themselves on the right side of the Kraun5ca
<>Vyu1ha (an army formation in the shape of a stork)
<>constructed by Bhi1s2ma. (S4loka 21, Chapter 75, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva). There is a statement in Chapter 65 of S4a1nti
<>Parva that a barbarous tribe called Tus2a1ras lived in
<>the country of Ma1ndha1ta1.
<HI>TUS2ITAS. There were twelve good devas called Tus2itas
<>in the Ca1ks2us2a Manvantara. When the Ca1ks2us2a Man-
<>vantara ended and the Vaivasvata Manvantara com-
<>menced all the twelve were born as sons of Kas4yapa of
<>his wife Aditi. Because they were born of Aditi they
<>were called Dva1das4a1dityas. They were Vis2n2u etc. Thus
<>the Tus2itas of the Ca1ks2us2a Manvantara were the
<>Dva1das4a1dityas of Vaivasvata Manvantara. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<HI>TUS2T2I. A daughter of Daks2a. She became the wife of
<>Dharmadeva. Dharmadeva accepted as wives the
<>thirteen daughters of Daks2a including Tus2t2i. Their
<>younger sister Khya1ti etc were married to Mari1ci etc.
<>(Chapter 7, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>TUS2T2IMA1N. A King of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (9th
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>TVAS2T2A1 I. A Praja1pati. This Praja1pati was an asura
<>also. (Su1kta 94, Anuva1ka 14, Man2d2ala 1, R2gved2a).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There are contradictory statements in the
<>Pura1n2as regarding the birth of Tvas2t2a1.
<NI>(a) Vis4vakarma1 got four sons named Ahirbudhnya,
<>Tvas2t2a1 Ajaikapa1t and Rudra. The great ascetic Vis4va-
<>ru1pa was the son of Tvas2t2a1. (Chapter 15, Am3s4a 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a). [Page800-a+ 64]
<NI>(b) Kas4yapa got as his sons the Eka1das4arudras of his wife
<>Surabhi. Surabhi who became pure by penance got by
<>the grace of Maha1deva five other sons named Aja,
<>Ekapa1t, Ahirbudhnya, Tvas2t2a1 and Rudra. The noble
<>and famous Vis4varu1pa was the son of Tvas2t2a1. (Chapter
<>18, Agni Pura1n2a).
<NI>(c) Kas4yapa Mahars2i got a son named Tvas2t2a1 of his
<>wife Aditi. (S4loka 34, Chapter 226, A1di Parva).
<NI>Because of such varied statements it is not possible to
<>say whose son Tvas2t2a1 was.
<NI>2) {%Indra's enemy.%} Even from the beginning, Tvas2t2a1
<>hated Indra. Tvas2t2a1 begot of his wife Recana1 a son
<>named Vis4varu1pa to kill Indra. Vis4varu1pa was the
<>younger brother of Sannives4a. Vis4varu1pa was called
<>Tris4iras also. (See under Tris4iras). While Vis4varu1pa
<>was doing penance Indra killed him by his Vajra1yudha.
<>Enraged at this Tvas2t2a1 produced another asura named
<>Vr2tra to kill Indra. (See under Vr2tra). Indra killed
<>Vr2tra1sura also. At last greatly disappointed Tvas2t2a1
<>cursed Indra that he would suffer from Putraduh2kha
<>(loss of son) and then went to the mount Meru to do
<>penance.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Tvas2t2a1 also treated as a Rudra. (Chapter 15, Am3 a
<>1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>(ii) When the forest of Kha1n2d2ava was burnt, he stood
<>on the side of Indra and fought against Kr2s2n2a and
<>Arjuna. He separated huge portions from the mountain
<>and threw them against Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a. (S4loka 34,
<>Chapter 226, A1di Parva).
<NI>(iii) Tvas2t2a1 shines in the court of Indra. (S4loka 14,
<>Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iv) Kus4eru, daughter of Tvas2t2a1 was once abducted
<>by Naraka1sura. (Chapter 38, Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Sabha1
<>Parva).
<NI>(v) Vis4vakarma1 also used to be called Tvas2t2a1. (S4loka
<>24, Chapter 100, Vana Parva).
<NI>(vi) The monkey called Nala was the son of Tvas2t2a1.
<>(S4loka 41, Chapter 283, Vana Parva).
<NI>(vii) Tvas2t2a1 presented Subrahman2ya with two Pa1rs2a-
<>das named Cakra and Anucakra. (S4loka 40, Chapter
<>45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>TVAS2T2A1 II. A King of the family of Bharata. This
<>Tvas2t2a1 was the son of Bhauvana and father of Viraja.
<>(5th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>TVAS2T2A1DHARA. One of the two sons of S4ukra1ca1rya
<>who were deputed to do heinous acts of worship by S4ukra.
<>The other was Atri. (S4loka 37, Chapter 65, A1di
<>Parva).
<H>U
<HI>U ({#u#}). The letter ‘u’ means S4iva. (Agni Pura1n2a,

<>Skandha).
<HI>UCATHYA. A muni in the line of the disciples of Vya1sa.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 12).
<HI>UCCAIS4S4RAVAS I.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} A horse which emerged from water during
<>the churning of the sea of Milk. (See under Ks2i1ra1bdhi-
<>mathana). Devendra grabbed it the moment he saw it,
<>and thenceforth it became his vehicle. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 23, Verses 33-37). [Page800-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Colour of the horse.%} Once, during a controversy, Vinata1,
<>wife of Kas4yapa, contended that the colour of Uccais4s4ra-
<>vas was white, while another wife of Kas4yapa, Kadru1
<>said that its tail was black in colour. It was decided to bet
<>that she who got defeated in this controversy should
<>become the slave of the winner. Because the serpents,
<>the sons of Kadru1, cheated Vinata1, she had to become
<>Kadru1's slave. (See under Vinata1). (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 20).
<NI>3) {%Laks2mi1devi1 became mare.%} Devi1 Bha1gavata relates a
<>story of Maha1laks2mi1 becoming a mare on account of
<>Uccais4 ravas. King Revanta, son of Su1rya and friend of
<>Indra, once went to Vaikun2t2ha to pay his respects to
<>Bhagava1n Vis2n2u, riding on Uccais4s4ravas. Maha1laks2mi1,
<>who was then with Vis2n2u was surprised at the arri-
<>val of Revanta. Seeing the scintillating form of
<>Uccais4s4ravas, her brother, Maha1laks2mi sat looking at
<>the horse unmindful of all other things. (Maha1laks2mi1
<>and the horse were both born from the Sea of Milk and
<>hence were sister and brother). Thus occupied Maha1-
<>laks2mi1 did not hear Maha1vis2n2u asking, “Who is this one
<>who comes like a second Cupid?” Angry at this Vis2n2u
<>said--
<NI>“So much attracted by the horse, you have not answered
<>me. Because you enjoy (Ramasi) so much your name in
<>future will be Rama1. You will also become frivolous
<>like an uncultured woman. You have never been
<>constant. Because you felt so much attracted to this
<>horse in my very presence, you will be born as a mare
<>in the world of men.”
<NI>According to this curse Maha1laks2mi1 had to be born as
<>a mare in the world; the Hehaya dynasty had its origin
<>from her. (See under Ekavi1ra). (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 6).
<HI>UCCAIS4S4RAVAS II. A Maha1ra1ja of the Pu1ru dynasty.
<>He was one of the six sons of King Aviks2it. (M.B. A1di

<HI>UCCHIKHA. A serpent born in the family of Taks2aka.
<>It was burnt to death at Janamejaya's serpent yajn5a.

<HI>UDA1NAVA1YU. One of the five life-breaths. The five
<>life-breaths are Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Sama1na, Uda1na and

<HI>UDAPA1NA TI1RTHA. A holy bath on the bank of the
<>river Sarasvati1. It is said that Balabhadra Ra1ma,
<>while going on a pilgrimage, had visited this holy bath.
<>There is a story showing how this place became a
<>holy bath. Long ago there was a hermit named Gautama,
<>who had three sons called Ekata, Dvita and Trita.
<>The father was much pleased at the dutiful and devo-
<>tional character of his sons. One day he performed a
<>sacrifice and went to heaven. Then the kings and the
<>priests who were present for the sacrifice began to
<>honour and respect Trita. Ekata and Dvita did not
<>like this. The three brothers performed sacrifices and
<>acquired a large number of cows. With these cows
<>they started for the east. Trita walked before. Ekata
<>and Dvita who were behind, made a consultation and
<>drove the cows another way. Trita walked on in front,
<>alone. On the bank of the Sarasvati1 he saw a wolf and
<>getting terrified, he fell into a well in which there was
<>no water. Standing in the well, he imagined a creeper [Page801-a+ 65]
<>that was hanging to the well as ‘Soma’ (a herb used as
<>oblation in sacrifice) and performed sacrifice, chanting
<>the Vedas. His chanting was heard in heaven and
<>Br2haspati and other gods came to him and asked him
<>what boon he desired. Trita told them that he only
<>wanted to be saved from the well. Immediately the
<>river Sarasvati1 flowed into the well and the waves began
<>to swell. Standing on the waves he praised and glori-
<>fied the gods. Then he returned home and cursed
<>Ekata and Dvita and transmuted them into wolves.
<>Trita said that their children would become monkeys
<>and cattle. It happened so. The place where the Gods
<>appeared before Trita, became famous and got the name
<>Udapa1nati1rtha. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 36).

<HI>UDAYAGIRI I. The mountain of the rising. It is sup-
<>posed by poets that the Sun and the Moon rise from this
<>mountain.
<HI>UDAYAGIRI II. An ancient place of pilgrimage. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 84,
<>Stanza 93, that by conducting evening prayer and
<>devotion at this place once, one could obtain the fruits
<>of conducting evening prayer and meditation for twelve
<>years continuously.
<HI>UDAYANA. A renowned king of the Candravam3s4a (Lunar
<>dynasty).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order: Brahma1-Atri-Candra-Budha-Puru1ravas-A1yus-

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There was a city called Kaus4a1mbi1 situated in
<>the middle of the famous kingdom known as Vatsa in
<>North India. The palace of king S4ata1ni1ka, born of the
<>family of Arjuna, was in Kaus4a1mbi1. Vis2n2umati1 was the
<>queen of S4ata1ni1ka. She had been childless. One day
<>while S4ata1ni1ka was hunting in the forest, he met with
<>the hermit S4a1n2d2ilya, by whose blessings Vis2n2umati1 con-
<>ceived and gave birth to a son. That son was Sahas-
<>ra1ni1ka. When he came of age, S4ata1ni1ka left the country
<>with his son and went to the heaven to help the gods
<>in their battle with the Asuras, and he died there.
<>Sahasra1ni1ka became a mighty emperor. Once he got an
<>invitation from Indra to go to heaven and help the
<>gods to fight the Asuras. After having defeated the
<>Asuras, one day, he was walking with Indra in the
<>Nandana Park, when he saw the gods playing with
<>their wives in the park. Immediately the unmarried
<>king became thoughtful and Indra read correctly, the
<>reason for the sudden change in the king and said to the
<>king. “Oh King! Don't be worried. A girl becoming [Page801-b+ 65]
<>you in every aspect, is born in the world. Her name is
<>Mr2ga1vati1.”
<NI>Sahasra1ni1ka was greatly pleased at this and he returned
<>to the earth. In the chariot there were Tilottama1 and
<>the charioteer, with the king. The king who was deeply
<>immersed in thinking about Mr2ga1vati1, did not attend
<>to the conversation of Tilottama1, who getting angry
<>cursed him thus:-“May you be separated for fourteen
<>years from the person whose thought has prevented
<>you from attending to what I have been telling you.”
<NI>The king married Mr2ga1vati1. She became pregnant.
<>One day she told the king about her desire to dip in a
<>pond of blood. The king got a pond ready, filled with
<>the juice of La1ks2a1 (a kind of wax, the boiled water of
<>which will look like blood) and such other things. Mr2ga1-
<>vati1 began to dip and splash in the pond of blood.
<>When she was dipping under the juice, taking her to be
<>a large piece of flesh, an eagle took her from the pond
<>and flew away. The king was overwhelmed with grief
<>and fell down. Then the charioteer came down from
<>heaven and informed the king of the curse of Tilottama1,
<>and then he returned.
<NI>The eagle left Mr2ga1vati1 in the mount of the Rising Sun
<>and flew away. She cried aloud. A huge snake neared
<>her to swallow her. Then a divine person appeared
<>there and saved her from the snake and vanished. Then
<>a hermit-boy came there and asked the lonely woman,
<>clad in only one garment, about her story and took her
<>to the hermitage of the hermit Jamadagni who blessed
<>her. After some days she gave birth to a son. At that
<>time an unknown voice was heard saying “This boy
<>would become the most renowned king Udayana and
<>his son would become the supreme Lord of the Vidya1-
<>dharas.” Because he was born in the Udaya1dri (the
<>mount of the Rising Sun) he got the name Udayana.
<>The boy Udayana grew up in the hermitage.
<NI>3) {%Udayana to his father.%} The hermit Jamadagani who
<>knew the past, present and the future performed all the
<>rituals, necessary for a boy of Ks2atriya caste (kingly
<>race) such as Caula, Upanayana etc. and gave him
<>education in every branch of knowledge. Because of her
<>love and regard for her son, Mr2ga1vati1 put on his arm a
<>bangle with the name Sahasra1ni1ka inscribed in it,
<>which she had been wearing so long. One day, while
<>Udayana was walking through the forest, he saw a
<>snake-charmer catching a snake. He felt sorry for the
<>snake. So he gave the bangle to the snake-charmer and
<>set the snake free. When the snake charmer was gone,
<>the snake told Udayana its story. That serpent was
<>Vasunemi, the elder brother of Va1suki. Out of grati-
<>tude the serpent gave Udayana the famous Lute
<>Ghos2avati1 and betels and taught him the art of making
<>garlands and marks on the forehead which would never
<>fade.
<NI>The snake-charmer took the bangle to the capital for sale.
<>Seeing the name of the king inscribed on it, the king's
<>men took him before the king. He told the king every-
<>thing. The king who had been suffering for the last four-
<>teen years form the pangs of separation, started for the
<>mount of the Rising Sun, without any loss of time. The
<>hermit Jamadagni gave him his wife Mr2ga1vati1 and son
<>Udayana. They all returned to Kaus4a1mbi1.
<NI>4) {%The anointment of Udayana.%} Sahasra1ni1ka anointed his
<>son Udayana as the heir to his throne, and appointed
<>Yaugandhara1yan2a, Rumanva1n and Vasantaka, the sons [Page802-a+ 65]
<>of three ministers, as ministers of Udayana. At the time
<>of the anointment there was a shower of flowers
<>from the sky and an unknown voice said “With the help
<>of these ministers Udayana would bring the whole of
<>the earth under his control.” After a time Sahasra1ni1ka
<>went to the Hima1layas with his wife for penance.
<NI>5). {%Va1savadatta1 became Udayana's wife.%} A daughter was
<>born to the king of Ujjayini1. Her name was Va1sava-
<>datta1. Her father Can2d2amaha1sena decided to give her
<>in marriage to Udayana the king of Vatsa. How to
<>bring this to pass? Can2d2amaha1sena and Udayana had
<>been enemies. Finally he found out a way. It was
<>to entrust Va1savadatta1 to Udayana (who was a great
<>teacher of music) for teaching her music. Ultimately he
<>would fall in love with her and thus Udayana would
<>become his son-in-law. This was the plan.
<NI>King Can2d2amaha1sena sent a messenger to Kaus4a1mbi1.
<>The messenger was sent back with a reply that, if his
<>daughter was sent to Kaus4a1mbi1, he would teach her
<>music. Can2d2amaha1sena did not like this. So he decided
<>to take Udayana a prisoner somehow or other. The
<>king had an elephant called Nad2a1giri. He ordered for
<>an artificial elephant to be made equal in size to
<>Nad2a1giri, and placed some soldiers inside the elephant.
<>The artificial elephant with soldiers inside it was taken
<>to the great forest in the Vindhya mountain and placed
<>there. The men of Udayana saw this elephant and
<>reported it to the king. Udayana decided to see the huge
<>elephant which had appeared in the Vindhya. Udayana
<>went to the forest and saw the huge elephant standing
<>at a distance. The king found out a plan to catch it.
<>Playing mild notes on his lute, the king alone neared
<>the elephant. As the night was drawing and as
<>he was immersed in music, he did not understand that
<>it was an artificial elephant. As the king was nearing
<>the elephant it went on retreating, and thus got the
<>king away from his men. Then the soldiers got out of
<>the elephant, surrounded the king and took him a
<>prisoner. Thus Udayana began to live in the palace of
<>Can2d2amaha1sena. His work was to teach Va1savadatta1
<>music.
<NI>The news reached Kaus4a1mbi1. Yaugandhara1yan2a entrust-
<>ed the affairs of the government to Ruman2va1n and
<>started for Ujjayini1 with Vasantaka. At Ujjayini1 they
<>got Yoges4vara, a Brahmara1ks2asa as friend. According
<>to his advice Yaugandhara1yan2a took the guise of a
<>mad old man. Vasantaka adopted the guise of a sick
<>man, suffering from pain in the stomach an uncouth
<>figure to look at. They entered the city. The madness of
<>Yaugandhara1yan2a was an entertainment to the people.
<>The ladies of the court liked him much. Va1savadatta1
<>invited the madman to the harem. Udayana instantly
<>recognized the mad man. Vasantaka also got admittance
<>to the palace. He told Va1savadatta1 the story of Loha-
<>jan3gha in an interesting way. (See under Lohajan3gha)
<>Va1savadatta1 began to be drawn more and more towards
<>Udayana. She seemed to have forgotten even about the
<>fact that her father was an enemy of Udayana, who
<>had been thinking seriously of means of escape from
<>the palace. Va1savadatta1 agreed to accompany him.
<>A1s2a1dhaka got Bhadra1vati1, the elephant of Va1savadatta1,
<>ready for the flight. In the night Udayana and his
<>retinue got on the elephant Bhadra1vati1 and fled from
<>the palace. Ka1n5canama1la1 the maid of Va1savadatta1
<>also accompanied her mistress. When they had passed [Page802-b+ 64]
<>the Vindhya mountain the elephant Bhadra1vati1 fell
<>dead. When they all were standing around the dead
<>elephant sadly, they heard an ethereal voice saying, “Oh
<>King! I am a Vidya1dhara woman called Ma1ya1vati1. I
<>had been an elephant for so long. The son you are
<>going to get, will also be helped by me. Your wife
<>Va1savadatta1 also, is a goddess, born as a woman
<>purposely.” Next day, all reached the palace of Udayana
<>and the marriage of Udayana and Va1savadatta1 took
<>place shortly. Can2d2amaha1sena recognized that marri-
<>age.
<NI>6) {%Udayana's marriage with Padma1vati1.%} Udayana spent
<>his days with Va1savadatta1 in the harem. The ministers
<>Yaugandhara1yan2a, Ruman2va1n, Vasantaka and others
<>thought that the behaviour of the King was detrimental
<>to the well-being of the country. They wanted to re-
<>move the King from the palace for a little while and
<>to form an alliance with the powerful King of Magadha.
<>By a marriage alliance all these could be achieved. The
<>King of Magadha had a beautiful daughter called
<>Padma1vati1. The ministers began to work with this end
<>in view.
<NI>Once Yaugandhara1yan2a took Udayana to the forest of
<>La1va1n2aka and stayed there. It was reported to the
<>King of Magadha that the King of Vatsa was drawing
<>near to his kingdom. Fearing an attack from Udayana,
<>the King of Magadha began to think of concluding a
<>treaty with Vatsa. The King of Vatsa used to go for
<>hunting everyday. One day he went to a distant place
<>for hunting, and the minister went to the house of
<>Va1savadatta1 and informed her of their plans. Though
<>it was not at all palatable to her, she gave her consent
<>and agreed to help them as it was meant for the well-
<>being of the King and the country. Accordingly,
<>Yaugandhara1yan2a took the guise of an old Brahmin,
<>Va1savadatta1 that of a young Brahmin lady and Vasan-
<>taka that of a Brahmin celibate with only one eye.
<>They went to the kingdom of Magadha. Ruman2va1n
<>set fire to the house of Va1savadatta1 and spread the
<>rumour that Va1savadatta1 and Vasantaka had been
<>burnt to death. Yaugandhara1yan2a, Va1savadatta1 and
<>Vasantaka reached Magadha. They got into the capital
<>and saw Padma1vati1 sitting in the garden. The old
<>Brahmin conversed with the princess for a while. She
<>enquired about the young woman who was with him.
<>The old Brahmin replied thus:--“She is my daughter
<>Avantika1. Her husband has left the country. I request
<>you to keep her with you till I find him out and bring
<>him here. She may not like to be separated from her
<>people. So let her brother, the celibate, also be here
<>with her.”
<NI>Padma1vati1 took them with gladness and Yaugandhara1-
<>yan2a, bidding farewell, returned to the forest La1va1n2aka.
<>Avantika1 and the Celibate lived in the palace with
<>Padma1vati1. Va1savadatta1 who had learned from Udayana
<>the art of making garlands ans marks on the forehead
<>which would not fade, had prepared them for Padma1-
<>vati1.
<NI>The King of Vatsa returned to the forest La1va1n2aka
<>and found the house of his wife burnt down to ashes.
<>He fell unconscious when he heard that Va1savadatta1
<>and Vasantaka had been burnt to death.
<NI>The spies of the King of Magadha who were in the
<>forest of La1va1n2aka, reported the rumour about the [Page803-a+ 64]
<>death of Va1savadatta1 and Vasantaka to their King in
<>Magadha, who wished to give his daughter Padma1vati1
<>in marriage to Udayana. The marriage proposal was
<>accepted by Udayana and wearing garlands and marks
<>that would not fade Padma1vati1 entered the wedding
<>dais. Udayana married Padma1vati1. Yaugandhara1yan2a
<>made the King of Magadha take an oath that he would
<>go for no more aggression. Udayana and his people
<>reached Kaus4a1mbi1. On the way the King happened to
<>see the mark on the forehead and the garland on the
<>neck of Padma1vati1 and asked her who had made them.
<>Padma1vati1 told the King the story of Avantika1.
<>Udayana was definite that Avantika1 was Va1savadatta1
<>herself. Avantika1 was brought before the King. Padma1-
<>vati1 congratulated Va1savadatta1. Both of them loved
<>each other and lived together as the loving wives of
<>Udayana. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalambaka).
<NI>7) {%Udayana gets a new throne.%} Once Udayana was
<>sitting in the court-hall, when a Brahmin came there
<>and made a complaint to the King that some cow-
<>herds had broken the legs of his son. The Brahmin
<>said that a boy named Devasena sat on a stone in the
<>forest and instantly he got kingly power. The leg of the
<>Brahmin boy was broken by the friends of Devasena
<>because he did not bow before Devasena.
<NI>When he heard the story, the minister Yaugandhara1-
<>yan2a said that that place must have some peculiarities.
<>Accordingly the men of the King dug the place. He
<>got a throne of gems. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam-
<>baka).
<NI>8) {%The son of Udayana.%} Va1savadatta1 became pregnant
<>and gave birth to a child. He was named Narava1hana-
<>datta. Na1rada granted him a boon that Narava1hana-
<>datta would become the emperor of the Vidya1dharas.
<>(See under Narava1hanadatta).
<NI>The princess of Taks2as4ila1 named Kalin3gasena1 fell in
<>love with Udayana and she came to Kaus4a1mbi1. But no
<>marriage took place. (See under Kalin3gasena1). Nara-
<>va1hanadatta, the son of Udayana, married Madana-
<>man5cuka1 who was the incarnation of Rati Devi1 (the
<>wife of Madana). Udayana entrusted the country
<>to his son and led a life of retirement with his wives.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>UDDA1LAKA I. A disciple called A1run2i of the teacher
<>A1yodhadhaumya. To know how A1run2i got the name
<>Udda1laka, see under A1yodhadhaumya.
<NI>It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7,
<>Stanza 12 that this hermit Udda1laka was a prominent
<>figure in the Durbar of Indra. Udda1laka had a son cal-
<>led S4vetaketu and a daughter called Suja1ta1. He gave
<>his daughter Suja1ta1 in marriage to his favourite disci-
<>ple Kahod2aka. The hermit As2t2a1vakra was their son. See
<>under As2t2a1vakra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 132).
<>Once Udda1laka caused the river Sarasvati1 to appear at
<>the place of sacrifice. From that day onwards Sarasvati1
<>got the name ‘Manorama1’ because when the thought
<>came to his mind (manas) the river made its appearance.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 33). It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 57, Stanza 10, that
<>Udda1laka expelled his son S4vetaketu from the house be-
<>cause the son was a hater of Brahmins.
<HI>UDDA1LAKA II. The story of another hermit of the name
<>Udda1laka is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva. Chapter 71. This hermit is known as Udda1laki [Page803-b+ 65]
<>also. Once this hermit happened to forget that he had
<>left flowers, food and his waterpot on the bank of the
<>river and reaching his hermitage, he asked his son
<>Na1ciketa to fetch them from the bank of the river.
<>When Na1ciketa reached the bank of the river, those
<>things had been washed down by the current. The son
<>returned and reported the matter to his father. The
<>father got angry and cursed his son to death. Seeing
<>the son lying dead on darbha (mattress made of darbha
<>grass) the hermit cried aloud. In that flow of tears life
<>returned to the body and the son woke up as if from
<>sleep. The father asked the son about the news of the
<>realm of Yama (the god of death) and the son told the
<>hermit the news about the world of the dead.
<HI>UDDAN2D2AS4A1STRI1. One of the eighteen and a half
<>famous poets of Kerala. He was a Sanskrit poet. His
<>native place was La1t2apura on the bank of river Pa1la1r
<>in Ton2d2aman2d2ala in the Tamilnad. The name of his
<>father was S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and that of his mothter was Ran3ga1-
<>devi1. Poet Ulloor says that S4a1stri1 had another name
<>Irugupana1tha. He had a very good education. After
<>having completed his education, he travelled through
<>A1ndhra, Karn2a1t2aka, Kalin3ga, Cola, Kerala and many
<>other countries and finally came to Kozhikode and
<>visited the King Ma1navikramamaha1ra1ja. At the instance
<>of the king he composed the drama called Mallika1ma1-
<>rutam. Besides this we have obtained only the ‘Kokila-
<>sandes4a’ and some other single poems of S4a1stri1. It is said
<>that there is a thesis on dramas also. S4a1stri1 was not
<>in the habit of respecting those who did not pay respect
<>to him, however superior they might be. So some say
<>that he was arrogant. A Malaya1la Brahmin called
<>Bhat2t2atiri of Ka1kkas4s4eri, rose against S4a1stri1 in Kerala.
<HI>UDDHAVA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A Ya1dava. He was a friend and
<>minister of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 186, Stanza 18, mention is made that Uddhava
<>was present on the occasion of the Svayam3vara (marriage)
<>of Draupadi1. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 218, Stanza 11, that at a famous cele-
<>bration held in the mountain of Raivata, Uddhava was
<>present. (See under Subhadra1).
<NI>Uddhava was a disciple of Br2haspati, and a man of
<>great intelligence. It was this Uddhava who brought the
<>dowry of Subhadra1 to Indraprastha, when Arjuna
<>married her. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 220, Stanza
<>30).
<NI>Once a king named S4a1lva besieged the city of Dva1r-
<>aka1. At that time Uddhava saved Dva1raka1. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 15, Stanza 9).
<NI>2). {%The message carried by Uddhava.%} Kam3sa sent Akru1ra
<>to Amba1d2i, and brought S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to Mathura1. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a killed Kam3sa and made Ugrasena king, and
<>stayed in the city of Mathura1 for a time. At that time
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a sent Uddhava to Amba1d2i to know about the
<>well-being of the people there. The moment Uddhava
<>entered Amba1d2i, the Gopas and gopa women, (cow-
<>herds) Yas4oda1 and Nandagopa, all surrounded him to
<>hear about S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. They felt much pleased at
<>knowing that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was getting on well. They sent
<>through him many presents to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. He got
<>all those presents into his chariot and took them to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in Mathura1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>3). {%The end.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a informed Uddhava before-
<>hand the fact that the Ya1dava dynasty was going [Page804-a+ 64]
<>to end. Uddhava felt grief and requested S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>to take him also to Vaikun2t2ha (the abode of Maha1vis2n2u).
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a taught Uddhava the doctrine that the body
<>of man and such other things seen in the whole universe
<>were nothing but mere delusion. At that time Uddhava
<>asked S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a twentyone questions about Bandha
<>and Moks2a (Bondage and deliverance).
<NI>To all these questions Sri1 Kr2s2n2a gave him satisfactory
<>answers. (Bha1gavata Skandha 11).
<NI>Before the destruction of Dva1raka1, the Yadus left the
<>city. They went to Prabha1sati1rtha, a place on the sea
<>coast and lived there. Uddhava who knew that the
<>destruction was imminent, bade farewell to them and
<>walked away alone. He was filled with a brightness.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did not stop him. (M.B. Mausala Parva,

<HI>UGRASENA I. King Ugrasena, father of Kam3sa.

<NI>2) {%Ugrasena became king.%} Ugrasena became king of Mathu-
<>ra1puri1. His Kingship was not a hereditary acquisition.
<>There is a story behind it. In olden days, in the plateau
<>of Ka1lindi1 there was a famous place called Madhuvana.
<>The place was called so because it was the abode of an
<>Asura named Madhu. Madhu had a son, Lavan2a. S4atru-
<>ghna killed him as he was a very troublesome fellow
<>and a thorn on the side of the Devas. S4atrughna then
<>established a beautiful kingdom there and ruled it. He
<>named it Mathura1. After the death of S4atrughna his
<>two sons ruled Mathura1. Then, when the Solar dynasty
<>came to its end, Mathura1 came under the Ya1davas.
<>A Ya1dava king called S4u1rasena ruled over the kingdom.
<>Vasudeva, father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was the son of S4u1rasena.
<>After the death of his father Vasudeva took up the pro-
<>fession of herding cows, and therefore Ugrasena,
<>another king of the Ya1dava dynasty had to become king
<>of Mathura1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Ugrasena and Kam3sa.%} There is a common belief that
<>Kam3sa was the son of Ugrasena. But, the Bha1gavata
<>relates the following to the effect that Kam3sa was born
<>to a Gandharva called Dramila of Ugrasena's wife.
<NI>When once Ugrasena's wife was in her monthly periods,
<>she walked in the forest with her companions. A Gan-
<>dharva called Dramila saw her then, felt attracted by her
<>and made her pregnant. Angered at this, she cursed
<>Dramila thus: “Since you have procreated a son in me,
<>while I am in my periods this son will be killed by a
<>boy born in my husband's family.” Kam3sa was the son
<>born to her in the above manner. Kam3sa ascended the
<>throne after putting Ugrasena in prison. According to the
<>curse of Ugrasena's wife, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was born in Ugra-
<>sena's family and he killed Kam3sa. Na1rada had informed
<>Kam3sa of the Dramila interlude. Kam3sa told this story
<>secretly to Akru1ra when the latter was deputed by him
<>to invite Kr2s2n2a to the dhanur yajn5a. (Bha1gavata, 10th
<>Skandha).
<NI>{%The name A1huka.%} Genealogy states that Ugrasena was
<>the son of A1huka. But, in certain contexts Ugrasena
<>is called A1huka also. “Afterwards we made A1huka-
<>Ugrasena King...” (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>128, Verse 39). [Page805-a+ 64]
<NI>5) {%Ugrasena imprisoned.%} Vasudeva, father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was Ugrasena's minister. Kam3sa, when he attained
<>majority imprisoned Ugrasena and became himself king.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 22).
<NI>6) {%Ugrasena regained kingdom.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Kam3sa with
<>the permission of Ugrasena and made him king again.
<>During the reign of Ugrasena, Jara1sandha and S4a1lva
<>attacked Mathura1puri1. (See under Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>7) {%Ugrasena and the iron rod.%} While Ugrasena was ruling
<>the Kingdom, the sages Vis4va1mitra, Na1rada and Kan5ja
<>once came to Dva1raka1. To insult the sages, the Ya1davas
<>brought before them, Sa1mba dressed as a pregnant
<>woman. The Ya1davas told the sages that she was Babhru's
<>wife, and wanted to be told whether the child she deli-
<>vered would be male or female. The sages understood
<>their evil mentality, and prophesied that Sa1mba would
<>deliver an iron rod fierce enough to annihilate the
<>whole Ya1dava race. According to the prophecy the
<>next day Sa1mba delivered an iron rod. The Ya1davas
<>imparted the news to Ugrasena, who got the iron rod
<>reduced to powder and deposited the powder in the sea.
<>He also enforced prohibition of liquor in the country.
<>(To know how the powder of the rod ruined the Ya1dava
<>dynasty see under Kr2s2n2a). (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<>Chapter 1).
<NI>8) {%After death.%} After his death, Ugrasena joined the
<>Vis4vadevata1s. Bhu1ris4ravas, S4ala, Bhu1ri, Kam3sa-
<>Ugrasena, Vasudeva, Uttara with his brother S4an3kha-
<>these kings (after death) joined the company of Vis4va-
<>devata1s. (M.B. Svarga1rohan2a Parva, Chapter 5, Verses
<>16, 17).

<>reached Gan3ga1dva1ra. When he got down into the river
<>Gan3ga1, he saw Ulu1pi1 the daughter of Na1gara1ja (King
<>of the serpents). He asked her a few questions. She
<>told him thus:--“I am the daughter of the serpent
<>Kauravya of the family of Aira1vata. I came to bathe
<>in the river and when I saw you I grew amorous.”
<>Arjuna told her that Dharmaputra had imposed on him
<>celibacy for twelve months and that it was not
<>right to marry in the meantime. Ulu1pi1 argued with
<>Arjuna and convinced him that it was not wrong to
<>marry her. Arjuna married her. A son named Ira1va1n
<>was born to her.
<NI>2) {%How Ulu1pi1 caused Arjuna to be killed and how he was

<>in Jaimini As4vamedha Parva.
<NI>This poor brahmin who lived by begging got one day
<>some food grain powder. After offering a portion of it
<>to Agni and Brahmins, he divided the balance equally
<>between the children. Then he sat down to take his own
<>food when Dharmadeva, disguised as a brahmin,
<>appeared and demanded food. Un5chavr2tti gave all his
<>food to the guest. Since that did not satisfy the guest,
<>the sons also gave their shares of the food to him. Great-
<>ly pleased at the noble act of Un5chavr2tti, Dharmadeva
<>took the brahmin family with him to Svargaloka. One
<>day a few particles of the foodgrain powder which re-
<>mained with the brahmin fell on the earth. A mongoose
<>came and played on that ground. That part of his body
<>which got smeared with the food-grain powder became
<>golden in colour. Though the mongoose went to the

<>process there, the remaining portion of its body did not
<>become golden.

<HI>UNMADA1. A celestial woman.
<NI>1) {%Became a woman by the curse of Uravas4i1.%} Ham3sa, the
<>King of Gandharvas (semi-gods) had a general of the
<>army called Durmada. He was a dangler. He had an
<>eye on Urvas4i1. She was the wife of Puru1ravas a famous
<>King. On several occasions Durmada followed Urvas4i1,
<>with lustful desire. He had expressed his amour for her
<>on several occasions. But Urvas4i1 did not pay any heed
<>to his words.
<NI>One day Puru1ravas and Urvas4i1 were present in the
<>durbar of Indra. Puru1ravas and Urvas4i1 had signalled
<>a rendezvous for that night at the corner of the Nan-
<>dana Park. Durmada understood this. He called a
<>celestial woman named Unmada1 to his side. They made
<>a plan and accordingly Unmada1 disguised herself as
<>Urvas4i1 and Durmada took the guise of Puru1ravas and
<>both of them entered Nandana park. Puru1ravas went to
<>Unmada1 and conjugated with her. In the same way
<>Urvas4i1 received Durmada, mistaking him for Puru1ravas.
<>After the conjugation Durmada laughed loud as if he
<>had played a trick on Urvas4i1. Urvas4i1 understood every-
<>thing. Puru1ravas also arrived there. Urvas4i1 cursed
<>Durmada to take birth in the earth as a Ra1ks2asa and
<>cursed Unmada1 to be born in the earth as the daughter
<>of a King and she said that at that time she would love
<>one man and become the wife of another man. The
<>aggrieved Durmada and Unmada1 prayed for liberation
<>from the curse. Urvas4i1 gave them liberation thus:--
<>“This Durmada will be born as the son of Unmada1.
<>Seeing the death of her husband and son, she would
<>jump into fire. After that she will enter heaven.
<>Durmada will be killed by the sword of an enemy and
<>will obtain heaven.” According to this curse Durmada
<>was born as the son of Di1rghajan3gha, the emperor of
<>Hiran2yapura, under the name Pinga1ks2a and Unmada1 [Page807-a+ 65]
<>was born as the daughter of the King of Videha. Her
<>name was Harin2i1 (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 3).
<NI>2) {%The marriage and death of Harin2i1.%} Harin2i1 grew up to
<>be a young woman Once Pin3ga1ks2a growing lustful took
<>Harin2i1 and went through the sky. She cried aloud for
<>a long time. Pin3ga1ks2a, the asura, left her in a wild
<>forest. At that time a King named Vasumanas came
<>by that way hunting. He killed Pin3ga1ks2a and then
<>having heard the story of Harin2i1 got her on the horse
<>called Ji1mu1ta and sent her to Videha (Mithila1). Her
<>father was much pleased at getting her back. He want-
<>ed to give her in marriage to Vasumanas. The date of
<>the marriage was fixed. Invitations were sent to many
<>Kings. Among them there was a king named Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya, who took her by force and went away. There
<>was a fierce battle between the two Kings, Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya and Vasumanas and Vasumanas was defeated. See-
<>ing this Divoda1sa, the King of Ka1s4i1, attacked Bhadras4re-
<>n2ya. Though Divoda1sa defeated Bhadras4ren2ya, he did
<>not like to harm the beaten King. So he returned to his
<>kingdom. Bhadras4ren2ya took Harin2i1 to his palace and
<>married her. A son was born to her and he was named
<>Durmada. This was the same Durmada who had
<>taken birth and died as Pin3ga1ks2a and who had been born
<>again as the son of Harin2i1. This Durmada took by force
<>the daughter of his uncle called Citra1n3gi1 and a child
<>was born to them. Bhadras4ren2ya again engaged in a
<>battle with Divoda1sa, the King of Ka1s4i1, and was defeat-
<>ed. Then his son Durmada got into the battlefield and
<>he also was defeated.
<NI>When all this news reached Vasumanas, the King
<>of Ayodhya1, he became jealous of Bhadras4ren2ya. A
<>battle was fought between them in which Vasumanas
<>was defeated. But a fierce battle was fought again in
<>which Bhadras4ren2ya and his son Durmada were killed.
<>Durmada obtained heaven. Stricken with grief at the
<>death of her husband and son, Harin2i1 got into fire and
<>went to heaven. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 3).
<HI>UNMA1DINI1. A beautiful woman. She was the daughter
<>of a Vais4ya in the city of S4ra1vasti1. He went to the King

<>not marry her. From that day onwards the King grew
<>morbidly torpid and finally died.

<HI>UPACITRA. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 67, Stanza 95). In the Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 136 Stanza 22 it is mentioned that he
<>was killed by Bhi1masena.
<HI>UPADEVA. A King of the Pu1ru dynasty.
<HI>UPAGA1HA. A son of Vis4 va1mitra. He was a Brahmava1-
<>din. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 56).
<HI>UPAGIRI. A hilly place in North Bha1rata. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 27, Stanza 3).
<HI>UPAGUPTA. A King of the Candravam3s4a (Lunar
<>dynasty). (See under Genealogy).
<HI>UPAJALA1. A river. In the Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 13, Stanza 31, it is mentioned that by bathing
<>in this river the King Us4i1nara got power and position
<>higher than that of Indra.
<HI>UPAKI1CAKAS. Ki1caka, the brother-in-law of King
<>Vira1t2a, had one hundred and five brothers. They are
<>called Upaki1cakas. Ki1caka and the Upaki1cakas were
<>born of a portion of Ka1lakeya an asura. At the palace
<>of Vira1t2a, Ki1caka harassed Pa1n5ca1li1 and was killed in
<>the night by Bhi1ma. (See under Ki1caka). Hearing
<>about the death of Ki1caka, the hundred and five Upaki1-
<>cakas came there and decided to burn Pa1n5ca1li1 also,
<>because they thought she was the cause of the death
<>of their elder brother. They bound and carried her to
<>the cremation ground. Hearing her loud cry, Bhi1ma
<>jumped over the wall and ran to the cremation ground.
<>He uprooted a tree, killed all the hundred and five
<>Upaki1cakas and brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to the palace. (M.B.
<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 23).
<HI>UPAKOS4A1. The daughter of the teacher Upavars2a. (See

<HI>UPAKOSALA. See under Satyaka1ma.
<HI>UPAKR2S2N2AKA. A warrior of Skandadeva. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 57).
<HI>UPAMANYU I. A dutiful disciple of the teacher
<>Ayodhadhaumya. This teacher had three disciples of
<>prominence. They were A1run2i, Upamanyu and Veda. [Page808-a+ 62]
<>To know how Upamanyu was put to test by the teacher
<>see under Ayodhadhaumya.
<HI>UPAMANYU II. In the Kr2tayuga, there lived a hermit
<>named Vya1ghrapa1da who had two sons. They were
<>called Upamanyu and Dhaumya. Some learned men
<>are of opinion that Upamanyu the son of Vya1ghrapa1da
<>and Upamanyu the disciple of Ayodhadhaumya, were
<>one and the same. Once Upamanyu visited another her-
<>mitage along with his father. He happened to drink the
<>milk of the cow there. After that they returned to their
<>own hermitage, Upamanyu went to his mother and
<>asked her to make milk pudding for him. But the
<>mother felt very sorry because there was no milk. At
<>last she mixed flour in water and made pudding and
<>gave it to him. Upamanyu did not accept it. His mother
<>told him that there was no way to get milk and that men
<>could get wealth, crops etc. only by the grace of S4iva.
<NI>Upamanyu who was of a wilful nature did penance
<>with meditation and contemplation on S4iva. Finally
<>S4iva appeared before him in the shape of Indra and
<>told him to ask for his boon. Upamanyu boldly replied
<>that he wanted no boon from anybody else except S4iva.
<>S4iva made his appearance in his own form and made
<>Upamanyu a deva (God).
<NI>Upamanyu said all these things when he talked with
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 14).
<NI>In the Book “Our hermits,” written by Ra1masva1mi
<>S4a1stri1 in Tamil, it is mentioned that Upamanyu had
<>written a book “S4iva bhaktavila1sa” in which biogra-
<>phies of devotees of S4iva of great attainments are given.
<HI>UPAMANYU III. In the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a we come
<>across another Upamanyu as the son of a hermit named
<>Sutapas. Upamanyu reached the hermitage of Kas4yapa,
<>with the idea of marrying Sumati, the daughter of
<>Kas4yapa and the elder sister of Garud2a. Nobody liked
<>the idea of giving Sumati in marriage to that old man.
<>The hermit got angry at this and cursed Kas4yapa that
<>if he gave his daughter in marriage to any Bra1hman2a
<>his head would break into a hundred pieces. (Brahma1-
<>n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 18).
<HI>UPANANDA I. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Bhi1masena killed
<>him. (M.B. Karn2a Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 19).
<HI>UPANANDA II. A serpent. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 103, Stanza 12).
<HI>UPANANDA III. A warrior of Skanda. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 64).
<HI>UPANIS2AD. The four Vedas are R2k, Yajus, Sa1ma and
<>Atharva. Each of these four has a Bra1hman2a (a treatise
<>relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony).
<>Next come the A1ran2yakas (forest texts--writings meant
<>for the forest-dwelling hermit) as appendices to the
<>Bra1hman2as. Then come the Upanis2ads as appendices
<>to the A1ran2yakas. These four classes of literary works
<>(the Vedas, the Bra1hman2as, the A1ran2yakas and the
<>Upanis2ads) constitute the Vedic literature proper. The
<>A1ran2yakas and the Upanis2ads are inseparably connected
<>with each other. The Upanis2ads are called Veda1ntas
<>(the end of the Vedas). The bulk of these Veda1ntas
<>belong to different periods anterior to the Later Vedic
<>Period. The students begin the study of Upanis2ads
<>only after having completed the study of the Mantras
<>(Vedic hymns) and the Bra1hman2as (the ritual). [Page808-b+ 64]
<NI>The meaning of the word ‘Upanis2ad’ is that which is
<>most near. Upa = near. ni = most. sad = exist.
<>(or sit). The Upanis2ads can be called the Jn5a1naka1n2d2a
<>of the Vedas. They describe the nature of Brahman.
<>The figure of the supreme Spirit (Brahman) exists in
<>the Upanis2ads. Apparently the Upanis2ads are expla-
<>nations of the mantras, but they are concerned more
<>with the allegorical significations and the mystic mean-
<>ings of the tattvas or essence, of the origin of life, the
<>world, the soul, God etc. The Upanis2ads are the basis
<>of the S2ad2-dars4anas, the six systems of philosophy.
<>There are a large number of Upanis2ads. The most
<>important among them are 108 in number.
<HI>UPAPA1TAKA (UPAPA1PA) (Minor sins). In accord-
<>ance with the Ra1s2trami1ma1m3sa1 (political philosophy)
<>of Ancient India, crimes were divided into two types.
<>They were called Upapa1takas (minor crimes) and
<>Pa1takas (major crimes). To know about major crimes
<>(Pa1takas) see under Pa1pa (sin). Upapa1takas are given
<>below:--Cow-slaughter; sacrificing by one who is
<>unworthy to perform it; seducing another man's wife;
<>forsaking one's father, mother and teacher; forsaking
<>self-study, agni (fire) and son; becoming Parivetta1 (one
<>who gets married before one's elder brother is married.)
<>Younger brother finishing education before the elder;
<>giving an unmarried girl to Parivitti or Parivetta1;
<>performing sacrifice by a parivitti or a parivetta1; slan-
<>dering an unmarried girl; Living on the interest of
<>money that is lent; violating one's vow; selling pond,
<>garden, wife or son; becoming an outcaste; forsaking
<>relatives; Teaching the Vedas after receiving remune-
<>ration; selling things which should not be sold; working
<>in mines; working with big machinery; destroying
<>medicinal herbs; living by women; to impede rites;
<>cut down fresh trees (not dried) for fire-wood; kidnap-
<>ping women; mingling with slanderers of women;
<>selfish activities; eating forbidden rice; not keeping
<>Sacrificial fire; theft; not repaying loan; learning for-
<>bidden sciences; doing things which are bad and will
<>cause grief to others; stealing of base metals, grains and
<>cows; contact with drunken women; killing women,
<>S4u1dra, Vais4ya and Ks2atriya and becoming an infidel
<>are all Upapa1takas.
<NI>Causing grief to a Brahmin; inhaling the smell of liquor
<>and other prohibited things; resorting to tricks or
<>deceit and engaging in pederasty are sins which would
<>make one an outcaste.
<NI>Slaughter of dog, donkey, camel, lion, sheep, jungle-
<>goat, fish, serpent and mungoose are sins of a mixed
<>character.
<NI>Receiving money from the despicable; buying and
<>selling; serving a s4u1dra; telling a lie; acting so as to
<>render oneself unworthy; killing worms and birds;
<>eating food along with liquor; stealing fruits, flowers
<>and butea; and becoming a coward are also sins.
<HI>UPAPLAVYA. A minor city in the country of Vira1t2a.
<>This minor city stood near the capital city of Vira1t2a
<>Kingdom. After their incognito-life, the Pa1n2d2avas
<>are said to have lived in the city of Upaplavya. (M.B
<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 72, Stanza 14).
<HI>UPAPURA1N2AS. See under Pura1n2a.

<NI>2) {%How he got the name Uparicaravasu.%} Once Vasu built
<>a hermitage and began to perform penance in accord-
<>ance with the advice of Indra. When the penance
<>became too severe Indra appeared and gave him an
<>aerial chariot. Since then Vasu used to travel through
<>air in the chariot. So he got the name ‘Uparicaravasu’
<>(Vasu, who travels above). (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 63).
<NI>3). {%Vasu and Indra festival.%} Indra gave Vasu a garland
<>(Vaijayanti1ma1la1) which would never fade, and gave a
<>boon that, so long as he wore that garland, he would
<>not receive any wound. He was given a bamboo stick
<>(Ven2udan2d2a) and was instructed to fix that rod on
<>the earth and celebrate the festival of Indra. Vasu
<>celebrated the festival of Indra and from that day on-
<>wards the festival of Indra came to be celebrated in the
<>world. (See under Indrotsava).
<NI>4). {%The sons of Vasu.%} Five sons named Br2hadratha,
<>Kus4a1mba (Man2iva1hana), Mavella, Yadu and Ra1janya
<>were born to him.
<NI>5). {%Kicking and splitting Kola1hala.%} The river S4ukti-
<>mati1 flowed through the capital city of Vasu. Once the
<>great hill Kola1hala grew amorous of S4uktimati1 and
<>caught hold of her. Uparicaravasu got angry at this
<>and kicked the mountain which was split into two and
<>S4uktimati1 flowed out of the gap. Still two children
<>were born to the great hill by S4uktimati1. The river
<>was pleased at the freedom accorded by the king and
<>placed the two children at the feet of the king. They
<>grew up. The son became general of the army and the
<>daughter Girika1 became the wife of the king. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva Chapter 63).
<NI>6). {%Vasu goes ahunting.%} One day the king decided to
<>go to hunt. On the same day his wife had her monthly
<>course. Still without changing his programme he started
<>for the forest. Even after entering the forest the thought
<>of his wife lingered in his mind. The forest was in full
<>bloom as it was Spring. Seeing this the king grew
<>amorous and sat under a tree. A mild breeze was blowing.
<>Instantly the king had seminal flow. He collected the
<>semen in the leaf of a tree and sent it to the queen
<>through an eagle. Thinking that to be some food, an-
<>other eagle got near and a quarrel arose. The semen
<>fell in the river Yamuna1. A fish named Adrika1 swall-
<>owed it. (See under Adrika1). A fisherman caught hat
<>fish. He got a male child and a female child from the
<>stomach of the fish. That girl is the famous Satyavati1
<>Matsyagandha1 who became the queen of S4antanu. (See
<>under Satyavati1). The fisherman gave the boy he got
<>from the fish to king Uparicaravasu. (M.B. A1di Parva
<>Chapter 62).
<NI>7). {%Other information.%}
<NI>(i) It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 8, Stanza 20, that Uparicaravasu was famous
<>as a member of the council of Yama.
<NI>He was a friend of Indra, a devotee of Vis2n2u and a
<>righteous and diligent man who loved and esteemed
<>his father. Because of the grace of S4ri1 Na1ra1yan2a, he [Page809-b+ 65]
<>secured an empire. He consecrated everything before
<>god. Once Indra gave him half of his seat. (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 355). Because of the grace of
<>Bhagava1n (Lord), Garud2a made him a traveller of the
<>sky. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 337, Stanza 37).
<NI>(iii). In Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 337,
<>Stanza 38, it is mentioned that finally Uparicaravasu
<>entered the world of Brahma1.
<NI>(iv). Once a controversy arose between Indra and
<>the hermits, whether cow-slaughter during sacrifices,
<>was desirable. At this time Uparicaravasu happened
<>to come there. As he was a man of truth, he was asked
<>to make a decision. Uparicaravasu stood on the side
<>of Indra and gave his opinion in favour of slaughter.
<>The hermits who were against cow-slaughter got
<>angry and cursed Uparicaravasu to go down to the
<>world of Pa1ta1la (netherworld). (Matsya Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 152).
<NI>This story is seen with slight difference in Maha1bha1rata
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 322-324.
<HI>UPAS4LOKA. A son born to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a by Sairandhri1.
<>He learned all sciences and Philosophies and finally

<>vata, Skandha 10).
<HI>UPAS4RUTI. The patron-goddess of Uttara1yan2a (The
<>sun's progress towards North in the former half of the
<>year). In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 166
<>mention is made of how this goddess made it possible
<>for Indra1n2i1 to see Indra through the holes of a stalk of
<>lotus. It was by the help of Upas4ruti that S4aci1devi1 and
<>Indra met together. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>14, Stanzas 12 and 13).
<HI>UPATYAKA1. A country in Bha1rata. (Maha1bha1rata,

<>A life). All actions which are not good, must be relin-
<>quished. Those who observe Upava1sa should abstain
<>from using flesh, Masu1ra (pulse), can2aka (a kind of
<>gram), Varaku (a kind of grain), green leaves prepared),
<>honey, rice etc. and from contact with women. He
<>should not wear flowers, ornaments, or fashionable

<>several times, using betel leaves, sleeping in the day
<>time and sexual act also should be avoided. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 175).
<HI>UPAVEN2A1. A river. This river is considered to be the

<>Pa1n5ca1li1 were born to the King Drupada of Pa1n5ca1la as
<>the fruit of the sacrifices performed by these hermits.
<>The story is given below:
<NI>The famous teacher Dron2a was the son of the hermit
<>Bharadva1ja, who was a friend of the King Pr2s2ata of
<>Pa1n5ca1la. So King Pr2s2ata sent his son Drupada to the
<>hermitage of Bharadva1ja for education. Thus Dron2a
<>and Drupada were fellow students.
<NI>After completing his education Drupada became King
<>of Pa1n5ca1la. At that time the teacher Dron2a once visited
<>the palace of the King. But Drupada did not duly
<>receive his former classmate. Dron2a got angry at this
<>and went to Hastina1pura and became the teacher of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas. As a remuneration
<>for teaching them Dron2a demanded that Arjuna should
<>bind Drupada and bring him before him. Arjuna did
<>so. Drupada gave Dron2a a portion of his kingdom and
<>got his liberty. From that day onwards Drupada wished
<>for a son who would take revenge on Dron2a, and
<>requested the hermit Upaya1ja to perform a sacrifice for
<>getting a son. At first the hermit refused. The King
<>served the hermit for a year. The hermit was pleased
<>and asked the King to invite Ya1ja for the sacrifice. The
<>King did as he was told and Ya1ja and Upaya1ja came
<>to Pa1n5ca1la and performed the sacrifice for getting a
<>son. From the sacrificial dais Dhr2s2t2adyumna and
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 were born. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 166
<>and Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 80, Stanza 45).
<HI>UPENDRA. A synonym of Vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u once took
<>birth by Aditi the wife of Kas4yapapraja1pati. In that

<>as Va1mana too. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<HI>UPENDRA1. A river. (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 9, Stanza 27).
<HI>UPENDRABALA. Son of a minister of the King named
<>S4ri1 Datta. (See under S4ri1 Datta).
<HI>URAGA. A class of serpents. Ten daughters were born
<>to Krodhavas4a1 wife of Kas4yapa. The Uragas were born
<>from the daughter Kadru1 and the na1gas were born
<>from the daughter Surasa1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 14).
<HI>U1RDHVABA1HU. A son of Vasis2t2ha. His mother was
<>U1rjja1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20). It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 150, that this
<>U1rdhvaba1hu did penance in South India.
<HI>U1RDHVABHA1K. A fire. This Agni (fire) was the fifth
<>son of Br2haspati. (M.B) Vana Parva, Chapter 219,
<>Stanza 20).
<HI>U1RDHVAPUN2D2RA. A mark worn on the forehead
<>with yellow ochre. This mark should be made by earth
<>or ochre, which should be taken from the top of a
<>mountain peak, banks of rivers, seashore, S4aivite temple
<>serpent-hill or from under a holy basil. The fruits of
<>wearing the mark will vary according to the colour of
<>the ochre. Black ochre will afford peace, red soil will
<>procure docility, yellow soil will get prosperity, and
<>white ochre will give duty or righteousness. As the fruits
<>vary according to the colour, so also it will vary accord-
<>ing to the finger used to put the sign. If the mark is [Page810-b+ 65]
<>made with the thumb the man will become stout. If it
<>is done with the middle finger he will have long life. If
<>it is done with the fourth finger (ana1mika1), he will get
<>food and if it is made with the index finger (tarjani1) he
<>will get salvation. The form of the mark also could be
<>changed. The mark may be made in the form of a
<>flame, the leaf of bamboo reed, a lotus-bud, a fish, a
<>turtle or a conch. If the mark is as large as ten finger-
<>breadths it is superfine. If of nine finger-breadths, it is
<>medium super-fine; and if it is eight and a half finger-
<>breadths, it is lower superfine. In the same way if the
<>finger-breadth of the mark is seven, six or five they will
<>be super medium, medium medium and lower medium.
<>If it is four, three and two they will be of the low,
<>medium low and lowest.
<NI>It is also ordered that when one wears the U1rdhva-
<>pun2d2ra in a particular spot of the body one will have to

<>Vis4vakarma1. U1rjjasvati1 had ten brothers. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 8). Priyavrata gave U1rjjasvati1 to the
<>teacher-priest S4ukra. Devaya1ni1, the wife of Yaya1ti,
<>was the daughter born to S4ukra by U1rjjasvati1. (Bha1ga-

<HI>U1RMILA1. Laks2man2a married U1rmila1, the daughter of
<>King Janaka and the sister of Si1ta1. When Laks2man2a
<>went to the forest with S4ri1 Ra1ma and Si1ta1, U1rmila1
<>remained in Ayodhya1. After the forest life, S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a returned with Si1ta1. When S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>was ruling over the country, two sons were born to
<>Laks2man2a by U1rmila1. The elder son was named
<>Taks2aka and the second was given the name Chatra- [Page811-a+ 65]
<>ketu. At the instruction of S4ri1 Ra1ma, Laks2man2a went
<>to the Eastern sea and killed the foresters there and
<>built there a city called Agati1. Taks2aka was made the
<>King of Agati1. Laks2man2a then went to the western sea
<>and killed the Barbarians there and built a city called
<>Candramati1 and made Chatraketu the King of that
<>city. Being punished by S4ri1 Ra1ma, Laks2man2a drowned
<>himself in the river Sarayu1. (See under Laks2man2a).
<>After that U1rmila1 jumped into a pile of fire and reach-
<>ed the world of Vis2n2u. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>U1RN2A1. A wife of Mari1ci. In the Sva1yambhuva Man-
<>vantara Mari1ci had a wife called U1rn2a1 and six mighty
<>sons by her. When they saw Brahma1 once, they teased
<>him by calling him ‘a father who had married his daugh-
<>ter.’ Brahma1 got angry with them, and cursed them to
<>take birth as Daityas (demons) on the earth. Accord-
<>ingly they took birth as the sons of Ka1lanemi on earth.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>U1RN2ANA1BHA (SUDARS4ANA). A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 96). It is mention-

<>and Atimanyu. Six great sons were born to U1ru by his
<>wife A1treyi1. They were An3ga, Sumanas, Sva1ti, Kratu,
<>An3giras and Gaya. Vena was born to King An3ga by

<HI>URUKRAMA. Another name of Va1mana.
<HI>U1RVA (AURVA). A luminous hermit of the family of
<>Bhr2gu. He was the son of Cyavana and the father of

<>of the three worlds and extinguished it by putting it in
<>the ocean. (For details see under Aurva).
<HI>URVARA1. A celestial woman in the palace of Kubera.
<>In the company of some other celestial women, she
<>danced before the hermit called As2t2a1vakra. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 44).
<HI>URVARI1YA1N. Son of the Praja1pati Pulaha. Three sons
<>named Kardama, Urvari1ya1n and Sahis2n2u, were born to
<>Pulaha by his wife Ks2ama1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1,
<>Chapter 1).
<HI>URVAS4I1 I. A famous celestial damsel.
<NI>1) {%Birth of Urvas4i1.%} In days of old two hermits named Nara
<>and Na1ra1yan2a did penance to Brahma1 in the holy her-
<>mitage of Badarika1 for a thousand years. (Nara and
<>Na1ra1yan2a were the children born to Dharma, the son of
<>Brahma1). Because of the severity of their penance Indra
<>was struck with fear. Thinking that they were doing
<>this severe penance with a view to become Indra, he
<>approached the hermits and told them that they might
<>ask for any boon. Even though Indra told them several
<>times, they did not speak a word nor did they make any
<>stir. Indra's fear increased. So Indra decided to create
<>some delusions which would arouse in them fear, desire
<>etc., so that their penance might be broken. He began
<>to bring around them wild animals such as lion, elephant
<>wild snake etc. and natural phenomena such as storm, [Page811-b+ 64]
<>heavy rain, forest-fire etc. to terrify them. The efforts
<>of Indra were futile. The disappointed Indra sent for
<>Ka1madeva (Cupid) and consulted him, as a result of
<>which Ka1madeva and his wife Ratidevi1 with many
<>celestial maids came to the hermitage in the mountain
<>of Gandhama1dana with the intention of hindering the
<>penance of Narana1ra1yan2as. The season of spring was
<>created in the forest. The celestial women such as
<>Rambha1 and others came before the hermits and began
<>to sing and dance. The hearts of the hermits began to
<>swell with passion. When they opened their eyes what
<>they saw was a beautiful sight. The famous celestial
<>women, Menaka1, Rambha1, Tilottama1, Sukes4ini1, Mano-
<>rama1, Mahes4vari1, Pus2pagandha1, Pramadvara1, Ghr2ta1ci1,
<>Candraprabha1, Soma1, Vidyunma1la1, Ambuja1ks2i1, Ka1n5ca-
<>nama1la1, and others with their ten thousand and eighty
<>hand-maids stood before them. Hermit Na1ra1yan2a who
<>got terribly angry struck on his thigh with his hand
<>and instantly there arose a woman of extreme beauty.
<>Because she had originated from the U1ru (thigh) of
<>Na1ra1yan2a, that woman, who was the most beautiful
<>in the three worlds, got the name Urvas4i1. All the others
<>were struck with wonder at the sight of this new creat-
<>ion. After that so many other beautiful women also
<>were created. The hermit Na1ra1yan2a gave all of them
<>to Indra. With shame Indra accepted them and return-
<>ed to heaven along with them. Thus Urvas4i1 arrived
<>at the realm of the devas (gods). (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 4).
<NI>2) {%Position of Urvas4i1.%} It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata
<>that Urvas4i1 had the eleventh place among the singers.
<>The expert dancers were Anu1ca1na1, Adrika1, Somakes4i1,
<>Mis4ra1, Alambus2a1, Mari1ci, S4ucika1, Vidyutparn2a1, Tilot-
<>tama1, Ambika1, Ks2ema1, Rambha1, Suba1hu, Asita1,
<>Supriya1, Pun2d2ari1ka1, Sugandha1, Surasa1, Prama1thini1,
<>Ka1mya1 and S4a1radvati1. Urvas4i1 got the first place among
<>the celestial maids in beauty. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>123).
<NI>3) {%Urvas4i1 and Puru1ravas.%} Puru1ravas was the son of Budha
<>born of Ila1. He grew up and became a king of great
<>renown. His fame reached even the realm of the gods.
<>One day during that period Brahma1 cursed Urvas4i1. “Go
<>and be born on the earth.” (It is stated in the Devi1
<>Bha1gavata that it was Brahma1 who cursed Urvas4i1 and in
<>the Bha1gavata that it was the Mitra1varun2as who cursed
<>Urvas4i1). Urvas4i1 had heard about the fame of Puru1ravas
<>and had felt tender love for him. The celestial maid
<>reached the earth. She went to the palace of Puru1ravas
<>and saw him. Because of the perfection of their figures,
<>both loved mutually. The king asked her to become
<>his wife. She agreed. But she laid down three conditions.
<NI>(i) I have with me two lambs which I bring up as my
<>sons. You must take care of them. No harm should
<>befall them.
<NI>(ii) I take in only ghee. On no account should you
<>compel me to eat any other food.
<NI>(iii) Don't come near me in nudity except at the time
<>of coition.
<NI>The king agreed to all these conditions. From that day
<>onwards Urvas4i1 lived in the palace of the king as his
<>wife. They lived happily for a long while without
<>separating from each other.
<NI>Urvas4i1 became conspicuous by her absence in the realm
<>of the gods. She was the most expert actress in heaven. [Page812-a+ 65]
<>Indra missed her. So a search was made and they found
<>out that she was in the palace of Puru1ravas. Indra
<>asked the Gandharvas to bring that celestial woman to
<>heaven somehow. Vis4va1vasu and some others of the
<>Gandharvas reached the palace of king Puru1ravas and
<>waited for an opportunity. One midnight they stole
<>the lambs and took them away through the sky. At
<>that time the king was with Urvas4i1 in the harem.
<>Urvas4i1 heard the cry of the lambs and she was flurried.
<>She reviled the king who was not capable of taking care
<>of two lambs. Hearing her harsh words the king took
<>his bow and arrow and following the cry of the lambs
<>he was about to chase the thieves. Taking this oppor-
<>tunity the Gandharvas caused a lightning to flash in the
<>king's harem. In the light of the lightning Urvas4i1 saw
<>the king standing nude. The Gandharvas having achi-
<>eved their task had left the lambs and departed before
<>the king had got out of the room. The king caught
<>hold of the lambs and returned to the harem, within a
<>short while. But Urvas4i1 had gone out of the palace
<>and was on her way.
<NI>The king was full of grief. He wandered all over the
<>country in search of Urvas4i1. At last he reached Kuru-
<>ks2etra and saw Urvas4i1 there. He bowed low before
<>her and implored her to return to the palace. But
<>Urvas4i1 replied thus:--
<NI>“Women are like wolves. Don't have alliance with them
<>Oh King! Kings should not put faith in women and
<>thieves.”
<NI>Saying thus, Urvas4i1 vanished. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 1).
<NI>4) {%The reason why Puru1ravas had to remain separate from Urvas4i1.%}
<>Puru1ravas had once gone to heaven, in accordance with
<>the invitation of Indra to help the Gods in the battle
<>with the asuras. Indra had killed Ma1ya1dhara, a noble
<>Asura, in that battle and had celebrated a festival. In
<>that festival Rambha1 was dancing before Tumburu, the
<>sage-priest, and detecting some flaw in her dance Puru1-
<>ravas teased her. Rambha1 retorted by asking the King
<>what he knew about dance, and the king replied that he
<>had learned from Urvasi1 more dance than Tumburu the
<>teacher of Rambha1. Tumburu got angry at this, and
<>cursed the king Puru1ravas to suffer from the pangs of
<>separation from Urvas4i1. Stricken with grief, Puru1ravas
<>returned to his palace. It was after this that the Gan-
<>dharvas took away Urvas4i1. Puru1ravas went to Badari-
<>ka1s4rama and performed penance, meditating on God
<>Vis2n2u for the nullification of the curse. Urvas4i1, aggri-
<>eved by separation from her husband, sat motionless as
<>a picture, in the custody of the Gandharvas. Lord Vis2n2u
<>was pleased with the penance of Puru1ravas. The Gan-
<>dharvas brought her back to the King. Thus it became
<>possible for the king to meet Urvas4i1 at least once a year.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<NI>5) {%The sons born to Puru1ravas by Urvas4i1.%} The king became
<>very sad when Urvas4i1 was about to depart from him at
<>Kuruks2etra. Seeing his grief Urvas4i1 told him. “Oh
<>King, if you want so much to live with me, you have to
<>worship the Gandharvas. They will be pleased and
<>will give me to you. Don't be sorry. Now I am preg-
<>nant. Come to this place at the end of a year. We
<>can spend that night together. Then we will get another
<>son also that night.” Pleased at what Urvas4i1 had
<>said, the king returned to his palace. On completion
<>of a year Puru1ravas went to Kuruks2etra and spent a [Page812-b+ 65]
<>night with Urvas4i1. Urvas4i1 gave Puru1ravas a very
<>beautiful child and then she vanished. The king sat
<>there and praised the Gandharvas, who gave the king
<>an Agnistha1li1 (a fire pot). Because of his derangement,
<>thinking it to be Urvas4i1 the king took the stha1li1 (pot)
<>and wandered about in the forest. At last placing the
<>pot in the forest, the king returned to his palace. On
<>that day Treta1yuga (one of the four ages of the word)
<>commenced, and the Vedas dawned in his mind as
<>three in number. He returned to the place where
<>he had left the Stha1li1 in the forest and took it. After
<>that he made two ‘aran2is’ (wood from which fire is
<>kindled by attrition) out of a banyan tree and placed his
<>body between them and made fire. That fire is called
<>‘Ja1tavedas.’ Thus Ja1tavedas became the son of
<>Puru1ravas.
<NI>Puru1ravas generated three fires from Ja1tavedas. The
<>first of them is Pran2ava. The second is called Na1ra1yan2a
<>and the third Agnivarn2a. (S4ri1mad Bha1gavata, 9th
<>S4kandha).
<NI>To Puru1ravas six sons were born from the womb of
<>Urvas4i1. They were A1yus, S4ruta1yus, Satya1yus, Raya,
<>Vijaya and Jaya. (A little difference is observed in these
<>names in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 75,
<>Stanzas 24 and 25).
<NI>6) To know how a Gandharva named Durmada and
<>a Vidya1dhari1 named Unmada1 played a trick on Puru1-
<>ravas and Urvas4i1, see under Unmada1.
<NI>7) {%How Agastya and Vasis2t2ha were born to Mitra1varun2as be-
<>cause of Urvas4i1.%} In days of old there was a renowned
<>king named Nimi in the family of Iks2va1ku. He decided
<>to perform a sacrifice of a long duration. He began
<>preparation and invited famous hermits such as Bhr2gu,
<>An3giras, Va1madeva, Pulastya, Pulaha. R2ci1ka and others.
<>Finally he invited Vasis2t2ha. At that time Indra had
<>begun another sacrifice in heaven. So Vasis2t2ha went to
<>heaven for that sacrifice, telling Nimi that he would
<>conduct the sacrifice on his return. The emperor Nimi
<>did not like it. Recognizing the hermit Gautama as
<>the main priest, he began performing the sacrifice.
<>The sacrifice of Indra lasted for 500 years. When Vasis2-
<>t2ha returned after that, the sacrifice of Nimi was over.
<>Vasis2t2ha cursed Nimi. “You will become devoid of
<>body.” Nimi cursed back. “Let Vasis2t2ha also become
<>thus.”
<NI>The aggrieved Vasis2t2ha went to his father Brahma1 and
<>complained about the curse. Brahma1 told Vasis2t2ha.
<>“You penetrate the brightness of Mitra1varun2as and
<>stay there. In due course you will get a birth which is
<>not of a womb.” Hearing these words, Vasis2t2ha reached
<>the hermitage of Mitra1varun2as. He left his body there
<>and fused himself into their effulgence. During this
<>period Urvas4i1 came to that hermitage. Seeing her,
<>Mitra1varun2as had seminal flow. The semen fell in a
<>pot. From the pot two bright and handsome sons were
<>born. The first of them was Agastya and the second
<>Vasis2t2ha. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>8) {%Indra cursing Urvas4i1.%} Once Agastya went to the dur-
<>bar of Indra. On the occasion Indra asked Urvas4i1 to
<>dance. In the midst of the dance she saw Jayanta, the
<>son of Indra, and became amorous and her steps went
<>wrong. Na1rada who was playing his famous lute called
<>Mahati1 could not play well. Agastya got angry and
<>cursed Jayanta to become a bud. He cursed Na1rada
<>also. So his lute became the lute of the world. Urvas4i1 [Page813-a+ 65]
<>was born on the earth under the name Ma1dhavi1 due to
<>the curse.
<NI>9) {%Urvas4i1 changing Arjuna into eunuch.%} (See under

<NI>3) {%Indra testing Us4i1nara.%} Us4i1nara was a just and liberal-
<>minded King. Indra decided to test the King regard-
<>ing his liberality. He got Agnideva (fire-god) for his
<>help. Indra took the form of a Kite and Agni that of
<>a dove. Both flew down to Us4i1nara as if the Kite was
<>chasing the dove. Us4i1nara agreed to protect the dove.
<>The Kite argued with the King that it was not meet

<NI>2) {%Utathya drank up the sea dry.%} Varun2a deva had an
<>eye on Soma's daughter Bhadra1 when Utathya married
<>her. Incensed at the marriage, Varun2a carried Bhadra1
<>off to the sea one day when Utathya was not present.
<>Na1rada informed Utathya that it was Varun2a who
<>stole his wife. Though Na1rada, at the request of
<>Utathya, asked Varun2a to return Bhadra1 to the former
<>he did not oblige. Enraged at this Utathya drank up
<>the sea dry. Yet, Varun2a did not come round. Then
<>Utathya rendered all the lakes of Varun2a dry. Trem-
<>bling at this Varun2a returned Bhadra1 to Utathya and
<>prostrated at his feet. He pardoned Varun2a and gave
<>back the sea to him. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>154).
<HI>UTATHYA II. The muni Satyatapas. (See under

<>olden days. There are S4a1straic (scriptural) injunctions
<>as regards conducting utsavas. Utsava is an indispens-
<>able celebration when once the deity (idol) is in-
<>stalled in the temple. Utsava should be celebrated for
<>one day, three days or seven days in the very same
<>month in which the deity was installed, because non-
<>celebration of Utsava will render the installation in-
<>effective. Utsava should be conducted either during
<>Uttara1yan2a (movement of the sun from south to North)
<>or Vis2u (when the Sun is in the centre) or at a time
<>suitable to the temple authorities who conduct the
<>utsava in S4ayana, Upavana or Gr2ha. It should com-
<>mence with auspicious ceremonies like the sowing of
<>seeds of nine varieties of foodgrains, and with dance,
<>song, instrumental music etc.

<>lords of the ages of Manu (Manvantara1dhipatis).
<>Priyavrata, with his children ruled the country in all
<>happiness and prosperity for ten crores of years. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha). Utta1napa1da, the second
<>son of Sva1yambhuvamanu begot one son, Uttama by
<>his wife Suruci and another son Dhruva by his wife
<>Suni1ti. (See under Dhruva). (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1,

<>Chapter 28, Verses 38-39). He fought Kr2tavarma1 also.
<>(Dron2a Parva, Chapter 92, Verse 27-32). He was

<>other wife called Suni1ti. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1,
<>Chapter 11). See under Dhruva.
<HI>UTTAN3KA (UTAN3KA). An ideal disciple of Veda
<>who was the disciple of A1podadhaumya.
<NI>1) {%Uttan3ka and the Guru's wife.%} After entrusting manage-
<>ment of the a1s4rama to Uttan3ka, Veda once went out
<>on a tour of the country, and Uttan3ka stayed in the
<>A1s4rama carrying out the instructions of the Guru. Then
<>came the menstrual period of Veda's wife, and his other
<>wives requested Uttan3ka to do the needful, so that the
<>fertile period of their co-wife was not wasted. Uttan3ka's
<>reply to them was as follows:- “Asked by women, I
<>shall not do this improper act; and the preceptor has
<>not asked me to do such a thing though it might be
<>improper.”
<NI>His Guru, A1podadhaumya returned to the A1s4rama some
<>time after this, and was very pleased to hear about the
<>above incident. He blessed Uttan3ka. (M.B. A1di1 Parva,
<>Chapter 3).
<NI>2) {%His tuition fee.%} His education being over, it was now
<>time for Uttan3ka to give due offerings--tuition fee to his
<>guru, and Uttan3ka enquired of the guru as to what he
<>would have by way of daks2in2a1. The guru asked
<>Uttan3ka to get his wife's instruction in the matter and
<>act accordingly. Because of the aforesaid incident
<>(Uttan3ka not acting on the guru's wife during her
<>menstrual period) she had a grouse against him, and
<>therefore, asked him to bring as his tuition fee the ear-
<>rings worn by the Ks2atriya wife of King Paus2a.
<NI>Uttan3ka set out to procure the ear-rings. On the
<>way he saw an ox, and on its back a big man, who
<>called out to Uttan3ka to eat the excretion of the ox.
<>When Uttan3ka hesitated to do so, the man on the ox
<>asked him again to eat it, pointing out that his guru,
<>Veda, had done it. Then did Uttan3ka consume both
<>the excretion and urine of the ox, and did his oblat-
<>ions, in his perplexed mood, standing. Uttan3ka arrived
<>at the palace of King Paus2a and told him about the
<>object of his visit. The King agreed to it. But, when
<>Uttan3ka entered the Zenana Paus2a's Ks2atriya wife
<>could not be seen. When Uttan3ka told the King about
<>this, he remained thoughtful for some time and told
<>the former that he might surely have become impure
<>due to performance of oblations in the wrong manner,
<>and that his wife would not be visible, due to her
<>chastity, to the eyes of such impure folk. Uttan3ka
<>admitted to having, on his way, performed oblations
<>not in the proper manner, and then he sat down
<>facing the east after washing his hands, feet etc. and
<>performed oblation in the correct manner. Then did the
<>wife of King Paus2a become visible to him, and she, pleas-
<>ed at his humility, handed over her ear-rings to him.
<>She also advised him to be very careful about the ear-
<>rings as they had once been coveted by Taks2aka, King
<>of the serpents. Bidding adieu to the queen, Uttan3ka
<>saw the King and they sat together to take food. Not
<>only was the rice cold; but a hair was also found in it.
<>Uttan3ka cursed the King and rendered him blind,
<>and the King, in turn, cursed Uttan3ka not to have [Page815-b+ 64]
<>children. But, both of them became calm quite soon
<>and withdrew their curses.
<NI>On his way back to the A1s4rama with the ear-rings, he
<>had only just stepped into a pool for a wash, when a
<>naked Buddha sannya1sin, who was following him,
<>snatched and ran off with the ear-rings. It was really
<>Taks2aka disguised as the sannya1sin who thus snatched
<>the ear-rings. Uttan3ka chased him and caught him
<>when he assumed his original form of the serpent King
<>and disappeared into a cave. Uttan3ka waited at the
<>mouth of the cave stupefied, when Indra deputed his
<>Vajra1yudha to help Uttan3ka. The Vajra1yudha cut a
<>tunnel-like route to Pa1ta1la from the earth and through
<>the cave Uttan3ka reached Pa1ta1la by this route and
<>found out the palace of Taks2aka.
<NI>Though Uttan3ka praised and cajoled the Na1gas (ser-
<>pents) their King Taks2aka did not make his appear-
<>ance. Uttan3ka saw there two women, who had been
<>weaving clothes, and on one machine there were black
<>and white threads. The machine had one wheel with
<>twelve spokes and was turned by six boys. Also was
<>there a horse, and a man. When Uttan3ka praised them,
<>the horse and the man approached him. The man
<>advised Uttan3ka to blow through the anus of the horse
<>so that the snakes could be brought round. Uttan3ka
<>did so, when lo! from all the pores on the body of the
<>horse, flames of fire began sprouting out. When the
<>Na1galoka (country of serpents) got thus filled with fire
<>and flames, Taks2aka lost his nerves and came out with
<>the stolen ear-rings, which Uttan3ka received back. But,
<>that was the last day on which the rings had been
<>promised to be given to his guru's wife by Uttan3ka,
<>who remained there gloomy and sorrow-stricken at the
<>thought that he would not be able to travel all the
<>distance before sunset and give the ear-rings to the
<>guru's wife. Then the horseman gave the horse to
<>Uttan3ka, who reached the A1s4rama just in time when
<>the guru's wife was about to curse Uttan3ka for not
<>returning with the rings though it was nearly dusk time.
<>Now the guru and his wife blessed Uttan3ka, who de-
<>tailed to them his experiences since leaving the A1s4rama
<>in quest of the ear-rings. Then the guru spoke thus to
<>Uttan3ka--“The two women whom you found engaged
<>in weaving were Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1, the white and
<>black strings, day and night, and the six boys who
<>turned the wheel with twelve spokes were the six
<>seasons. The ox seen by you on the way was Aira1vata
<>(Indra's elephant), the horse seen in Pa1ta1la was Agni-
<>deva, and the horseman, Indra. The excretion you ate
<>on your way was nectar and that was the reason why
<>you did not die in the Na1galoka. Indra who is my
<>friend blessed you because of mercy towards you, my
<>disciple. You could bring back the ear-rings also be-
<>cause of Indra's blessings.”
<NI>Then the guru blessed Uttan3ka and the latter took
<>leave of thim. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>3) {%Uttan3ka and Janamejaya's serpent yajn5a.%} Uttan3ka,
<>determined on taking vengeance on Taks2aka, went
<>away directly from the a1s4rama to Hastina1pura, where
<>he met Janamejaya and told him the fact that it was
<>Taks2aka, who had bitten to death Pari1ks2it, his (Janame-
<>jaya) father. It was thus prompted by Uttan3ka to take
<>revenge upon Taks2aka that Janamejaya performed the
<>serpent yajn5a. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 3). [Page816-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%Uttan3ka and Dhundhuma1ra.%} See under Dhundhuma1ra.
<NI>5) {%Uttan3ka attained salvation.%} Uttan3ka was put up at a
<>place called Ujja1laka. When he became old, he went
<>about visiting many temples. During this tour one day
<>Uttan3ka saw a hunter in the forest called Gulika
<>attempting to steal the golden plates on the dome of
<>the Vis2n2u temple in Sauvi1ra. Gulika raised his sword to
<>kill Uttan3ka, when he told the former that he would
<>have to suffer the results of sin during many births
<>if he committed a sin. This admonition of Uttan3ka so
<>touched the heart of the hunter that he fell dead on the
<>spot with a repentant heart. Uttan3ka sprinkled Gan3ga1
<>water on the corpse of the hunter, who attained Vai-
<>kun2t2ha (abode of Vis2n2u). On the advice of Vis2n2u,
<>Uttan3ka went to Badari1 where he did tapas and also
<>attained Vaikun2t2ha. (Na1radi1ya Pura1n2a).
<NI>In Chapters 53-58 of As4vamedha Parva of Maha1-
<>bha1rata is related the story of one Uttan3ka muni, under
<>the caption ‘Utan3kopa1khya1na.’ In Maha1bha1rata
<>(original) he is referred to as Uttan3ka; but in its
<>Malaya1lam rendering he is called Utan3ka. There are
<>no substantial differences between the story of Uttan3ka
<>and that of Utan3ka, Veda's disciple. But, since, there
<>are differences, in certain aspects some information
<>about the Uttan3ka of the ‘Utan3kopa1khya1na’ is given
<>below--
<NI>1) {%General.%} Uttan3ka was a disciple of Gautama, the
<>husband of Ahalya1. The guru had more love for
<>Uttan3ka than for his other disciples, and therefore did
<>not permit the latter to leave the A1s4rama even after
<>the other disciples were sent away. Uttan3ka became
<>old; wrinkles attacked his body and greyness his head.
<NI>2) {%Tuition fee (Gurudaks2in2a1).%} Uttan3ka once returned
<>from the woods with firewood, in a very tired condition.
<>The daughter of the guru shed tears at the sight.
<>Gautama called Uttan3ka to him and asked him about
<>the cause of his grief and sorrow. Uttan3ka replied that
<>the hairs on his head turned grey on account of sorrow
<>that he was not permitted to leave the A1s4rama although
<>it was hundred years since he had gone there first as
<>disciple. Then Gautama permitted Uttan3ka to quit the
<>A1s4rama. Uttan3ka asked Gautama what he should
<>offer as tuition fee. Gautama consulted his wife on the
<>topic and she suggested as tuition fee the two ear-rings
<>of gems worn by the wife of King Sauda1sa, who used
<>to eat the flesh of man. Immediately Uttan3ka set out
<>to fetch the ear-rings and on his way met Sauda1sa in
<>the forest, and told the latter about his mission. Sau-
<>da1sa tried to eat Uttan3ka, who told him that he was
<>in duty bound to obtain the ear-rings for his guru's
<>wife and that, after fulfilling the mission, he would
<>return to Sauda1sa to be eaten up by him. Sauda1sa
<>agreed to the proposition. He directed Uttan3ka to his
<>wife Madayanti1, who spoke to him thus--“Devas and
<>Mahars2is covet these ear-rings. If I place them on the
<>ground, serpents will steal them; if handed over to
<>Ucchis2t2a, Yaks2as will steal them, and if the watchman
<>sleeps, Devas will snatch them off. Therefore, you
<>should bring some token for me to believe that you are
<>deputed by my husband.” Accordingly Uttan3ka went
<>back to Sauda1sa and returned to his wife with a token
<>from him, and Madayanti1 handed over her ear-rings to
<>Uttan3ka. Being told by Sauda1sa that Uttan3ka need
<>not return again to him, Uttan3ka started for Gautama's
<>a1s4rama with the ear-rings. Feeling hungry on the way, [Page816-b+ 65]
<>Uttan3ka tied to the branch of a vilva tree the ear-rings
<>bundled in deer skin and ate vilva fruits. Just then the
<>bundle of deer skin got untied and the ear-rings kept in
<>it fell on the ground. A serpent carried off the rings
<>between its teeth and concealed itself in a mole-hill.
<>Highly grieved and upset by the sight, Uttan3ka fell
<>down from the tree. For 35 days Uttan3ka dug the mole-
<>hill. Then Indra felt great sympathy for him, appear-
<>ed on the spot, and passed his Vajra1yudha through the
<>mole-hill. Then the earth burst open and Uttan3ka
<>entered Pa1ta1la through the opening, and a horse, its
<>tail white and the rest of the body black in colour
<>presented itself to him. It asked Uttan3ka to blow
<>through its anus. Uttan3ka did so and the Na1galoka
<>was filled with flames of fire. (The horse was Agnideva).
<>Then did the serpents return the ear-rings to Uttan3ka,
<>who returned with it to Gautama and presented it to
<>him (Gautama) as tuition fee.
<NI>3) {%Uttan3ka about to curse S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Uttan3ka once went
<>to Dva1raka1, and during their talk was about to curse
<>Kr2s2n2a for not attempting to bring about a compromise
<>between the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas. At once
<>Kr2s2n2a exhibited his Vis4varu1pa (himself as containing
<>the whole universe). Thereupon Uttan3ka saluted Kr2s2n2a,
<>who asked him to request for any boon. He prayed for
<>the boon that water might be made available in any
<>desert he visited. Kr2s2n2a told him that whenever he
<>required water he might successfully think of him.
<NI>4) {%Indra tested Uttan3ka.%} Some time afterwards, while
<>roaming about quite thirsty and tired in a desert,
<>Uttan3ka thought about Kr2s2n2a, and at once there ap-
<>peared before him a naked Can2d2a1la, his body covered
<>with mud. Dogs encircled him. Uttan3ka hesitated to
<>drink the water given to him by this Can2d2a1la, who had
<>some water with him. The Can2d2a1la again insisted on
<>Uttan3ka drinking the water, but he again refused the
<>offer. The can2d2a1la then disappeared with the dogs.
<>Within a few minutes a person with disc, conch, club
<>etc. about him appeared, and Uttan3ka recognised him
<>as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Uttan3ka told Kr2s2n2a that it was not
<>proper to give water to a brahmin through a can2d2a1la.
<>Kr2s2n2a's reply to this was as follows:--“I asked Indra to
<>give you nectar instead of water, and he argued that it
<>was not proper that men should be given nectar. I
<>pleaded for you again. Indra replied to this that he
<>himself would, in the guise of a can2d2a1la give nectar to
<>you, and he should not be found fault with, if you
<>refused the nectar. I accepted that proposition of his.
<>But, you did not accept nectar thus offered to you. So,
<>you cannot be given nectar now. But, there will appear
<>water-laden clouds in deserts which you traverse, which
<>would be known as ‘Uttan3ka clouds’ and they would
<>give you sweet water.
<NI>Uttan3ka was pleased, and it is the Uttan3ka clouds,
<>which form as per the above orders of Kr2s2n2a that cause
<>rain to fall, though rarely, in deserts even today.
<HI>UTTARA I. The son of King Vira1t2a of Matsya.
<>Mention is made in the Maha1bha1rata, Vira1t2a Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Stanza 9 that Bhu1min5jaya was another
<>name of Uttara. Uttara also accompanied his father
<>Vira1t2a, when he went to take part in the Svayam3vara
<>(choice of a husband) of Draupadi1. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 185, Stanza 3).
<NI>2) {%Uttara and Arjuna.%} See the paragraph Ajn5a1tava1sa
<>under Arjuna. [Page817-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%The end of Uttara.%} Uttara had taken part in the
<>battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas. It is
<>mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter
<>45, Stanza 77 that a combat took place on the first day
<>of the battle between Uttara and Vi1raba1hu. Uttara
<>attacked S4alya who killed Uttara. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 47, Stanzas 36 to 39). Uttara who met
<>with a glorious death in the battle, got a place in
<>heaven with the gods. (M.B. Svarga1rohan2a Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanzas 17 and 18).
<HI>UTTARA II. A King who had gone down because of
<>his contemptuous behaviour towards his superiors.
<HI>UTTARA III. A fire. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 221,
<>Stanza 29 and Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 22).
<HI>UTTARA1.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Daughter of Vira1t2a, the King
<>of Matsya. Her brother was called Uttara.
<NI>2) {%Up to marriage.%} The Pa1n2d2avas led their incognito
<>life in the capital of the Matsya Kingdom. Arjuna
<>adopted the name Br2hannala and was employed as the
<>tutor of princess Uttara1 in music and dancing. At the
<>end of the life, King Vira1t2a gave his daughter Uttara1
<>in marriage to Abhimanyu the son of Arjuna. (See
<>the paragraph Ajn5a1tava1sa (incognito-life) under Arjuna).
<NI>3) {%Son.%} The son born to Abhimanyu and Uttara1 was
<>Pari1ks2it, who became a very famous King later. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Stanzas 83 and 84). See the
<>seventh paragraph under As4vattha1ma1).
<NI>4) {%The death of her husband.%} Abhimanyu was killed in
<>the battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas. It
<>is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chap-
<>ter 78, Stanza 37 that Uttara1 fell unconscious, when she
<>heard of the death of her husband. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a consoled
<>Uttara1. In the Maha1bha1rata, Stri1 Parva, Chapter 20,
<>Stanzas 4 to 28 the lamentation of Uttara1 over the death
<>of Abhimanyu is mentioned.
<NI>5) {%To the forest.%} Uttara1 also was seen among the
<>women who accompanied Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, to a little dis-
<>tance when he went to the forest after the battle. (M.B
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 15, Stanza 10).
<HI>UTTARADIS4A1. See under Ga1lava.
<HI>UTTARAJYOTIS2A1. An ancient city which stood in the
<>western part of Bha1rata. It is said in the Maha1bha1rata
<>that Nakula conquered this city. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter

<>is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chap-
<>ter 30, Stanza 3 that Bhi1masena conquered Uttara
<>Kosala.
<HI>UTTARAKURU. A part of the Jambu1dvi1pa (Island of
<>Jambu1). Mention is made in the Maha1bha1rata that
<>during his conquest Arjuna had gone up to this place
<>and carried away from there plenty of wealth. It is
<>believed by common people that this place is inaccess-
<>ible to human beings. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 28,
<>Stanzas 7 to 20). The southern end of this place is the
<>Ni1lagiri and the Northern end Mount Meru. The in-
<>habitants are gifted people, with trees bearing flowers
<>and fruits, the flowers fragrant and the fruits sweet.
<NI>A particular type of tree known as Ks2i1ri1 (milky)
<>grows here from which milk will flow. There are also trees
<>which will give you whatever you ask. It was the belief
<>of ancient people that with the fruits of Ks2i1ri1, you could
<>make garments and ornaments. The soil of this
<>place contains gems and in the sand there is gold. [Page817-b+ 65]
<>Those who fall down from heaven live in this region.
<>The average age of the inhabitants of this place is said
<>to have been eleven thousand years. There is a kind of
<>bird in this place called Bha1run2d2a. These birds drag
<>dead bodies away to caves. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chap-

<>work called ‘Neminirva1n2a’ is also written by Va1gbhat2a.
<>This work deals with the story of Nemina1tha, a Jain
<>hermit.
<NI>Not much is known about Va1gbhat2a. He was a scholar
<>in rhetorical science. There are certain stories about
<>his writing the medical books. It was a period when the
<>muslims had beaten down the Brahmins. They had
<>taken away the medical science also from them. The
<>Brahmins considered this to be a disgrace to them. They
<>decided to select an intelligent boy and send him to a
<>Muslim physician. They selected Va1gbhat2a. The Brah-
<>mins disguised Va1gbhat2a as a Muslim boy and sent him
<>to the Muslim Physician on the other side of the river.
<>The boy went to the physician and told him that he
<>was coming from far away with the intention of learning
<>medical science. The teacher put certain questions
<>and understood that the boy possessed extraordinary
<>intelligence. He began to teach the boy the science
<>of medicine. Seeing the interest of the boy the teacher
<>asked the boy to eat food from his house and to learn
<>day and night. The Brahmin boy did not like to eat
<>the food of Muslims. The boy said that he had a relative
<>on the other side of the river and that he would go
<>there and have his supper and return for the night study.
<>The teacher agreed and thenceforward Va1gbhat2a
<>began to learn day and night. Within a short time he
<>completed learning.
<NI>One day the teacher was sleeping on the seventh storey
<>of the building and his disciple Va1gbhat2a was massag-
<>ing his legs. The boy soliloquised that fate had destined
<>him to massage the legs of a Musalman. Instantly he
<>cried bitterly, and the teacher awoke and understood
<>that the boy was not a Muslim, and tried to cut his
<>head. The boy thought: “The four Vedas and the six
<>S4a1stras say that there is a god. If it is true no harm
<>will come to me.” Then he jumped out of the window.
<>In consequence of this jump, he became a little lame
<>and no other harm befell him. He swam across the
<>river and reached the other side and told the Brahmins
<>everything. The Brahmins asked him what he imagined
<>when he jumped from the seventh storey. He replied
<>“I jumped with this imagination. The four Vedas and
<>the six S4a1stras say that there is a god. If it is true no
<>harm will come to me.” As soon as the boy had finish-
<>ed the Brahmins became angry and they all got up.
<>They said “You went wrong in using the doubtful ‘if’,
<>instead of the affirmative ‘As.’ The Brahmins joined
<>together and expelled him from the society. The boy
<>thought of going away somewhere. “But there won't be
<>another chance for somebody else to go and learn
<>medical science from the Muslim physicians. So before
<>going away from here I must make the fruits of my
<>efforts available to these people.” Thinking so he lived
<>there for a little longer. He lived there without ming-
<>ling with the Brahmins, cooking his food. It is believed
<>that Va1gbhat2a wrote ‘As2t2a1n3gasan3graha’ and ‘As2t2a1n3ga-
<>hr2daya,’ during this period. [Page818-b+ 64]

<>perform this sacrifice to protect himself from hurts
<>caused by oven, threshing stone, axe, cutting knife, and
<>other weapons. This sacrifice could be performed in a
<>cavity for kindling fire on the floor besmeared with
<>cowdung and mud. It should not be done in an
<>ordinary oven meant for cooking, in iron oven, in
<>earthernware or on ordinary floor. As all the deities
<>are having faces of fire, the sacrificial fire should not be
<>kindled by fanning the flame with hand, winnow, hide
<>of black antelope or cloth. By fanning the flame with
<>cloth, the sacrificer will contract disease; by winnowing
<>he would sustain loss of wealth; and death, by fanning
<>with hand. Plums, fruits, roots, curd, ghee etc. could
<>be used as burnt offerings. When these are not avail-
<>able, firewood, roots of herbs, grass etc. could be used
<>instead. Things to be offered as burnt-offerings should
<>be purified, first by sprinkling ghee on them. In the
<>absence of ghee, milk, curd and water may be used.
<>Using things which are unfit as burnt-offerings will
<>invite bad results.
<NI>In Vais4vadeva-sacrifice, half-burnt firewood used in

<>rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Stanza 10).
<HI>VAJRA1YUDHA (Thunderbolt). The famous weapon
<>of Indra.
<NI>1) {%The making of this weapon.%} In olden days a fierce
<>asura named Vr2tra was born. The Ka1lakeyas and
<>many other asuras became his followers. They began to
<>create havoc in the world, and cause harm to the
<>Devas. At last under the leadership of Indra, the Devas
<>went to Brahma1 and informed him of their grievances
<>and requested for advice as to the way of killing Vr2tra.
<>Brahma1 told them that only with a weapon made of the
<>bone of the hermit Dadhi1ca, could Vr2tra1sura be killed.
<>The Devas went to the bank of the river S4on2a and saw
<>the hermit Dadhi1ca, who was the foremost of munificent
<>men, doing penance there. Indra told him the purpose
<>of their visit. He told the Devas to take his bone, if it
<>was useful to them. Saying this he forsook his body. The
<>Devas took the bones of the hermit and gave them to
<>Vis4vakarma1 who made a powerful weapon with them
<>and gave that to Indra. They named the weapon the
<>‘thunderbolt.’ (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 100).
<NI>2) {%The face of Subrahman2ya was cut.%} Once Indra was
<>defeated by Naraka1sura. He went to the Hima1layas and
<>hid himself there. Unable to see their King Indra, the
<>devas went to Subrahman2ya. When Indra knew this, he
<>thought that Subrahman2ya had taken possession of the
<>world of the gods. So he came and fought with Su-
<>brahman2ya. The thunderbolt of Indra touched the face
<>of Subrahman2ya and wounded him. From the blood
<>which flowed from the face of Subrahman2ya two noble
<>men appeared who eventually became warriors of
<>Subrahman2ya. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalambaka,
<>Taran3ga 6). [Page822-a+ 64]
<NI>3) {%Daily thunderbolt.%} In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chap-
<>ter 5 and Am3s4a 2, Chapter 8, a process by which
<>thunderbolt is made daily in the evening from the water
<>particles thrown by Brahmins when they recite the spell
<>Ga1yatri1, is described.
<NI>In the evening, the fierce giants called the Mandehas
<>wish to eat the Sun. Praja1pati had given them a curse
<>that though their bodies would not perish they would
<>daily meet with death. So there is a fight between these
<>giants and the sun daily in the evening. At that time
<>the Brahmins recite the spell Ga1yatri1 with the Brahma-
<>pervading syllable ‘OM,’ and throw up water. This
<>water becomes the Vajra weapon, and burns the giant.
<NI>4) {%The thunderbolt became a tiger.%} The hermits Na1rada
<>and Parvata once went to the palace of the King
<>Sr2n5jaya. The King worshipped them and served
<>them for a long time, as a result of which a son was
<>born to him. Indra decided to lessen the superior
<>power of these hermits. Once the son of the King, who
<>was a mere boy, was playing in the forest. At the in-
<>struction of Indra, the thunderbold took the form of a
<>tiger and went to the forest and killed the boy. Sr2n5jaya
<>became very sad. Na1rada and Parvata brought the boy
<>to lite again and gave him to the King. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 30).
<HI>VAJRI1 I. Indra who wields the weapon Vajra (q.v)

<>(Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, 3: 8: 39-56; Va1yu Pura1n2a, 70
<>34-50). But in maha1 Bha1rata, mention is made only
<>about three wives of Vis4ravas, named Pus2potkat2a1, Ra1ka1
<>and Ma1lini1
<HI>VAKA DA1LBHYA (BAKA DA1LBHYA). A hermit of
<>Ancient India. The information obtained from Maha1-
<>bha1rata about this hermit is given below.
<NI>(He was a member of the council of Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 11).
<NI>(ii) Once Vaka Da1lbhya lectured to Yudhis2t2hira about
<>the greatness of Bra1hman2as. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>26, Stanza 6).
<NI>(iii) On another occasion he described the welfare of
<>eternal beings to Indra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>193).
<NI>(iv) Once he stopped S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, who was going to
<>Hastina1pura, and conversed with him on the way. (M.B.

<HI>VA1KPA1RUS2YA (Using harsh words). One of the
<>wrongs brought under the rule of chastisement in ancient
<>India. Without caring for the truth or falsity, a man
<>praising another with a view to tease or offend him,
<>is Va1kpa1rusya. The teasing may be aimed at some-
<>body with disabled members of the body or disabled
<>organs of sense. Besides, using heart-rending words also [Page822-b+ 65]
<>comes under this crime. In olden days kings issued
<>orders to fine anybody found guilty of this crime. Ordi-
<>narily the fine was 25 Pan2as. If the crime was committ-
<>ed against one who was below the level of the culprit
<>the fine to be paid was only half. If harsh words were
<>used against other women or people of a higher level
<>the fine was double. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 258).

<>Stanza 53).
<HI>VALA (BALA). An asura. It is stated in Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Bhu1mikhan2d2a, how Indra killed this asura.
<NI>One day Vala went to the sea for his evening worship.
<>Devendra saw the asura, shining with the radiance
<>of celibacy and the divine rod and deer-hide, praying
<>on the sea-shore. Instantly Indra cut him into two with
<>his weapon, the thunderbolt. Vala fell down motionless.
<>Mention is made about this asura in R2gveda, Man2d2ala
<>1, Anuva1ka 4. (For further details see under Bala).
<HI>VALA1KA (BALA1KA). A forester. (For further details

<>4, Verse 52).
<HI>VA1LIS4IKHA. See under Ba1lis4ikha.
<HI>VALKALA. See under Balvala.
<HI>VALLABHA I. The husband of Hemaprabha1, an un-
<>chaste woman. (See under Hemaprabha1).
<HI>VALLABHA II. Son of Bala1ka1s4va. He was a righteous
<>King. Vallabha had a son named Kus4ika. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 5).
<HI>VA1LMI1KI I. A hermit who was the first among poets
<>and the author of Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Knowledge about this hermit
<>who was the first among the poets of Bha1rata, is scanty.
<>So we have to depend mainly on some hearsay for the
<>life history of this sage.
<NI>It is said that Va1lmi1ki was the tenth son of Varun2a. But
<>in his younger age he fell into the hands of wicked
<>people and became a wicked man, like his friends. Then
<>his name was not Va1lmi1ki. Being a father, he had to
<>support his family. For this purpose he used to plunder
<>travellers. Once he happened to catch the Saptars2is
<>(the seven hermits) who passed by that way. The
<>hermits asked him whether his wife and children would
<>share the sins he had incurred by plundering. The
<>plunderer could not answer that unexpected question.
<>He ran home and asked his wife and children if they
<>would share the sins incurred by him. They were not
<>prepared to do so. In a moment his life underwent a
<>thorough change. He ran to the Saptars2is and knelt
<>before them. They imparted to the forester, knowledge
<>of the Vedas. The forester sat under a tree and began
<>to sing ‘Ra1ma Ra1ma.’ Days and months and years
<>passed, unknown to him. He did not know that white
<>ants had built a shelter above him. After several years
<>the Saptars2is returned by that way. They broke the [Page823-a+ 65]
<>ant-hill and took the hermit out. Because he came out
<>of Valmi1ka or white-ant-hill he came to be known as
<>Va1lmi1ki. He built his hermitage on the bank of the
<>river Tamasa1 and lived there with his disciples. It was
<>at this place that he composed the famous poem Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a. (For further details see under Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Va1lmi1ki shines in the palace of Indra. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7, Stanza 16).
<NI>(ii) Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Stanza 27, that Va1lmi1ki met S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>who was going to Hastina1pura as a messenger of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>(iii) Sa1tyaki recited a poem composed by Va1lmi1ki,
<>after having killed Bhu1ris4ravas in the Bha1rata-battle.
<>(M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 143, Stanza 57).
<NI>(iv) Va1lmi1ki told Yudhis2t2hira of the benefits of his
<>devotion to S4iva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>18, Stanza 8).
<HI>VA1LMI1KI II. One of the prominent sons of Garud2a.

<HI>VA1MA1. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 12).
<HI>VA1MADEVA. An ancient hermit.
<NI>1) {%Va1madeva and S4ala.%} Three sons named S4ala, Dala
<>and Bala were born to King Pari1ks2it by his wife Sus4o-
<>bhana1, a princess of Man2d2u1ka. In due course, King
<>Pari1ks2it anointed his eldest son S4ala as King and went
<>to the forest for penance.
<NI>Once S4ala went to the forest to hunt. While chasing
<>a deer, the King asked his charioteer to bring horses
<>capable of overtaking the deer. The charioteer told the
<>King that such horses were available at the hermitage
<>of Va1madeva. They went to the hermitage of Va1ma-
<>deva and got the horses on condition that they would
<>be returned.
<NI>After the hunting, S4ala reached his capital. Seeing the
<>beauty and the vigorous nature of the horses, the King
<>did not like to part with them. Va1madeva sent his
<>disciple to the court of the King to take the horses back.
<>But the King sent him back empty-handed. Va1madeva
<>got angry. He came in person and demanded his horses.
<>The King replied that Brahmins did not require such
<>horses. While these two were quarrelling with each
<>other, some fierce giants came there and pierced S4ala
<>with a trident and killed him. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 192).
<NI>2) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(i) He was a friend of Vasis2t2ha and a priest of Das4aratha.

<>to King Vasumanas. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 92).
<HI>VA1MADEVA II. A King. Arjuna defeated this King
<>during his regional conquest of the North. (M.B. Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 27, Stanza 11). [Page823-b+ 65]
<HI>VA1MADEVA III. One of the seven sons born to Manu
<>by his wife S4ataru1pa1. It is stated in Matsya Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 4, that the Brahmin was born from the face,
<>Ks2atriya from the hand, Vais4ya from the calf of the leg
<>and S4u1dra from the foot, of Va1madeva, who was an
<>incarnation of S4iva. This Va1madeva who had five
<>faces and a trident in his hand, fought with Candra,
<>when Ta1ra1 the wife of Br2haspati was carried away by
<>Candra. (Matsya Pura1n2a, 4-13).
<HI>VA1MANA I. An incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} There are ten main incarnations
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Of these, the incarnation of Va1mana is
<>the fifth.
<NI>2) {%Two Va1manas.%} Two different stories occur in the
<>Pura1n2as about the incarnation of Va1mana. One story
<>is about how Maha1vis2n2u took the incarnation of Va1mana
<>and thrust Maha1bali an asura, down to the nether-
<>world. This story is more widely known. In the second
<>story the place of Maha1bali is given to the asura called
<>Dhundhu. This is the main difference. For a compara-
<>tive study, both stories are given below:
<NI>a) {%The first story of the incarnation of Va1mana.%} The devas
<>(gods) such as Indra and the others were born to Praja1-
<>pati Kas4yapa by his wife Aditi and the asuras (demons)
<>such as Maha1bali and others, by his wife Diti. The
<>Daityas (asuras) began to harm and harass the Devas
<>to a great extent. Once Aditi, the mother of the Devas,
<>complained to Kas4yapa about this. He advised her to
<>take the fast called ‘Payovrata’ fixing the image of
<>Maha1vis2n2u in her heart and that he will take birth
<>through her as Va1mana and destroy Maha1bali. Accord-
<>ing to the advice of her husband, Aditi began to take
<>Payovrata, at the end of which Maha1vis2n2u appeared
<>before her and asked her what her wish was. She told
<>Vis2n2u, of her grievances and Vis2n2u consoled her and
<>said “You have invoked me by your prayer and fast
<>for the safety of your sons. So I will enter your womb
<>through the penance of Kas4yapa and take birth as your
<>son and rescue your sons.”
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u disappeared. Aditi worshipped her husband
<>with devotion. By contemplation Kas4yapa knew every-
<>thing. He infused the energy he had acquired by
<>penance into Aditi, who gave birth to a son. The birth
<>took place on the twelfth day of the month of Bha1dra-
<>pada, in the bright lunar fortnight at the auspicious
<>moment called Abhijit, in the star of S4ra1van2a. The
<>infant had four hands. While Kas4yapa and Aditi were
<>looking on, the infant changed its form and became a
<>dwarfish Brahmin boy. The Devas brought presents
<>to the child. The Sun taught him the spell called Sa1vitri1-
<>mantra. Br2haspati gave the Brahmastring. Kas4yapa
<>gave the string worn round the waist. The earth gave
<>the hide of a black antelope. Soma the Vanaspati gave
<>a rod; Aditi gave the cloth over the privities, the sky
<>an umbrella, the seven hermits gave Kus4a-grass, Brahma1
<>gave a waterpot, Sarasvati1 gave a rosary and Kubera
<>gave a pot.
<NI>At that time, the powerful Maha1bali had brought the
<>three worlds of heaven, earth and Pa1ta1la (the nether-
<>world) under his control. That Asura King performed
<>a horse-sacrifice with the help of a Bha1rgava Brahmin.
<>Hearing about it Va1mana started for the place of sacri-
<>fice. Maha1bali was performing the sacrifice at a place
<>called Bhr2gukacchaka on the North bank of river
<>Narmada1. The priests who were performing the rites [Page824-a+ 65]
<>and ceremonies of the sacrifice saw Va1mana coming
<>slowly to the sacrificial hall. They wondered whether it
<>was the Sun, Sanatkuma1ra or Agni (Fire) coming to
<>see the sacrifice. While they were standing thus, Va1mana
<>with his umbrella, rod and water pot filled with water
<>entered the sacrificial hall. Maha1bali welcomed Va1mana
<>and asked him the purpose of his visit. Va1mana said
<>“Oh King! Your words are sweet. Noble Asura! give
<>me three feet of ground which I measure with my feet.
<>That is all what I want.”
<NI>Maha1bali agreed. The teacher-priest S4ukra felt some
<>doubts regarding the identity of Va1mana. So he secret-
<>ly told Maha1bali that the boy Va1mana was none other
<>than Maha1vis2n2u and as such, he should not give any
<>promise. But Maha1bali had already given the promise.
<>He refused to go back upon his words. The priest
<>S4ukra got angry at this and cursed Maha1bali thus.
<>“You boast that you are wise and learned. But you are
<>disobedient, slow-witted and unwise. So all your
<>prosperities will be destroyed.”
<NI>Though he was cursed, he did not deviate from the
<>path of truth. He gave the promised ground to
<>Va1mana by pouring water with the water brought
<>in golden pot by his queen Vindhya1vali1. The names,
<>As4ana1 and Kot2ara1 also are used in the Pura1n2as for
<>Vindhya1vali1 the wife of Maha1bali. She came out for
<>the purpose wearing golden ornaments. Maha1bali
<>himself washed the feet of Va1mana, who instantly
<>began to grow and became large beyond imagination.
<>Everybody on the spot was amazed at the unimagin-
<>able bigness of Va1mana. On that huge figure, Maha1bali
<>saw the priest, the performers of sacrificial rites, the sacri-
<>ficial hall, the universe, the elements, the qualities the
<>senses, the mind, the individual spirits, and at the feet
<>of the figure the world Rasa1tala. He saw the earth on
<>its feet, mountains below the knees, birds on its knees,
<>the Maruts on its thighs, evening on its clothes, the
<>Praja1patis on its privities, the noble and mighty asuras
<>on its lions, the sky on its navel, the oceans on its stomach,
<>Dharma (duty) in its heart, rightness and truth on its
<>breasts, Maha1laks2mi1 holding lotus on its chest, songs
<>of Sa1man and all other voices in its neck, all the gods
<>beginning with Indra on its hands, the points (direct-
<>ions) on its ears, the ether on its head, the clouds on
<>its hair, breaths in its nose, the sun in its eyes, fire on
<>its face, the Vedas in its words, Varun2a in its tongue,
<>day and night agreement and disagreement in its wink-
<>ing and anger on its forehead. In its touch there was
<>desire, in its radiance there was water, in its buttocks
<>Jawlessness, sacrifice in its steps, death in its shadow,
<>illusion in its laugh, medicines in its hairs, rivers in its
<>veins, stones in its nails, Brahma1 in its intelligence,
<>hermits, devas etc. in its life-breaths. Thus the figure
<>was seen by Maha1bali. Va1mana had trodden on the
<>whole of the earth, which was completely under the
<>cont ol of Maha1bali, with one foot, filled the whole of
<>the sky with his large body and the four points were filled
<>with his hands. The second step was put on Maharloka,
<>Janaloka and Tapoloka (three worlds). No spot was
<>left in the universe for a third step.
<NI>Va1mana said:--“You have given me three feet of
<>ground. I have measured two feet of ground. Show me
<>the place to measure the third step. I have measured
<>the earth with one step and the heaven with the second
<>step. You have seen it. If you cannot keep your promise [Page824-b+ 65]
<>you had better go down to Pa1ta1la.” Bali requested him
<>to place the third step on his head. Va1mana placed his
<>foot on the head of Maha1bali and thrust him down to
<>Pa1ta1la.
<NI>Va1mana brought Indra to the spot and anointed him
<>as the ruler of heaven, in the presence of all the gods
<>and hermits. Indra sent Va1mana with the Lokapa1las
<>(Indra, Agni, Yama and Varun2a) in a divine Vima1na
<>to the world of Vis2n2u. (Bha1gavata Skandha 8).
<NI>b) {%The second story of the incarnation of Va1mana.%} Dhundhu,
<>an asura boy, was born to Kas4yapa by his wife Danu.
<>That asura did penance and pleased Brahma1. He made
<>a request that he should not be killed by Indra and
<>the other gods or anybody else. Brahma1, who was
<>pleased at his penance, gave him the boon he asked.
<>The boy Dhundhu, at the beginning of the fourth
<>Kaliyuga, during the period of Hiran2yakas4ipu, went to
<>heaven and defeating Indra and the other Devas,
<>established his rule there as Indra. The mighty
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu was travelling on the mountain Mandara
<>as an official under Dhundhu.
<NI>The defeated and grief-stricken Devas went to the
<>world of Brahma1 and lived there. Dhundhu, who knew
<>this, wanted to drive them out of that place also. He
<>requested S4ukra, the priest and teacher of asuras, to
<>tell him the means of doing it.
<NI>S4ukra said. “Devendra was enabled to enter the
<>presence of Brahma1, because he had performed one
<>hundred horse-sacrifices. “Hearing this, Dhundhu, with
<>the permission of the teacher S4ukra, began to perform
<>sacrifice in the holy place called Pra1ci1na ti1rtha.
<NI>Hearing that Dhundhu had begun the horse-sacrifice,
<>Indra and the Devas trembled with fear and, leaving
<>the world of Brahma1, went to the world of Vis2n2u and
<>prayed for protection. Bhagava1n came to know of
<>everything and consoled them and sent them back.
<>After this Maha1vis2n2u took the form of a Va1mana
<>and jumped into the Devika1jala and lay afloat like a
<>piece of dry wood. Dhundhu and the hermits saw by
<>chance, Va1mana sinking and coming up in the water.
<>They took the Va1mana-Brahmin out of water and asked
<>him how he had fallen in water. Va1mana replied with
<>shiver:--“In the family of Varun2a there was a Brahmin
<>named Prabha1sa, who was a scholar. I am Gatibha1sa,
<>the younger of his two sons. After the death of father,
<>I requested my brother to divide the property of our
<>father. My brother quoted several rules and said that
<>I was not entitled to get any portion of my father's
<>wealth. I spoke against him and getting angry he
<>caught me by my hair and threw me into the river. It
<>is a year since I, being not able to swim, began to sink
<>and come up in this river. Thus you have seen me
<>here.”
<NI>The Bha1rgavas who were present there, requested
<>Dhundhu thus. “Oh! King of the asuras! Be pleased
<>to give this boy a well-furnished house, servant-maids
<>and plenty of wealth.” Hearing this Dhundhu said to
<>Va1mana. “I will provide you with wealth, servant-
<>maids, house, gold, cows, land, clothes etc.”
<NI>Va1mana humbly said to Dhundhu “Oh Lord! I do
<>not want any wealth. It is my desire for wealth that
<>has brought me to this plight. I request you to give
<>me only three feet of ground.”
<NI>As soon as the asura-King complied with his request,
<>Va1mana began to grow like the moon. He assumed the [Page825-a+ 62]
<>shape of Trivikrama to measure each of the three
<>worlds with a foot. In two steps he measured all the
<>worlds. Va1mana whose body was bigger than Maha1-
<>meru became angry when he did not see place to
<>measure the third step, and fell on Dhundhu. By this
<>heavy fall there appeared a great cavity thirty thousand
<>yojanas deep. Bhagava1n Vis2n2u took the asura Dhundhu
<>and threw him into that deep pit with a mighty force,
<>and by a shower of dust he filled the cavity.
<NI>Indra with the Devas occupied the world of Gods.
<>Leaving the asura King in the sea of dust, Bhagava1n
<>jumped into the river Ka1lindi1 and disappeared. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 78).

<>written several poems and dramas. Imitating the poem
<>‘Meghasandes4a’ of Ka1lida1sa, he had written a poetic
<>work of the same type called ‘Ham3sasandes4a’. A minor
<>Drama called S4r2n3ga1rabhu1s2an2a was written by this

<HI>VARA1HA III. (Boar). One of the ten incarnations of
<>Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>1) {%Need for this incarnation.%} Jaya and Vijaya, two door-
<>keepers of Maha1vis2n2u showed disrespect towards
<>the famous hermits Sanaka and others who went to
<>visit Maha1vis2n2u. The angry hermits cursed them to take
<>birth as asuras. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya took birth
<>as the two asuras Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2yakas4ipu and
<>were born from Praja1pati Kas4yapa by his wife Diti.
<NI>Even their birth itself was inauspicious. Once, while
<>Kas4yapa was carrying on evening worship, his wife was
<>filled with libid. She embraced Kas4yapa. Because she
<>got pregnancy in an inauspicious moment, two asura
<>sons were born. At the time of their birth darkness
<>spread over the whole of the world, and some ill omens
<>were seen. The Devas (gods) trembled.
<NI>The elder son was called Hiran2ya1ks2a and the second
<>son was called Hiran2yakas4ipu. As Hiran2ya1ks2a grew up
<>he began to quarrel with the Devas. When the fight
<>grew fierce, he picked up the earth in his hands as a
<>ball and went under water. There was left only water.
<>The Devas went to Maha1vis2n2u and prayed to him in
<>order to get the earth back.
<NI>At this time Manu Sva1yambhuva, the son of Brahma1,
<>was living with his father looking after his welfare. The
<>father, who was pleased with the services of his son
<>said. “My dear son, you should worship Devi1, who will
<>be pleased with your devotion and will bless you. If
<>she is pleased with you, you will become a famous
<>Praja1pati.” Hearing the words of Brahma1, Sva1yam-
<>bhuva worshipped Devi1 with ardent devotion, deep
<>meditation and severe vows and penance, at which
<>Jagadamba1 was pleased. She appeared before him and
<>asked him what boon he wanted. Manu requested that
<>he should be permitted to carry on creation without
<>any obstruction. Devi1 gave him permission. Manu [Page827-a+ 65]
<>returned to his father Brahma1 and said. “Father, point
<>out to me a solitary place. I will sit there and create
<>subjects by the blessings of Devi1.” Only when he heard
<>the request of his son, did Brahma1 begin to think about
<>the exigency of providing his son with such a place. For,
<>the earth was completely under water. For a long time
<>even Brahma1 was being subjected to much incon-
<>venience to carry on creation. Only Bhagava1n A1di
<>Na1ra1yan2a (Vis2n2u) could do anything in this matter. So
<>Brahma1 with the Manus, hermits and others began to
<>meditate on Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>2) {%Incarnation.%} Instantly the young one of a Boar
<>jumped out of the nose of Brahma1 through his breath.
<>That divine figure of Boar stood in the air and began to
<>grow. Within a few moments, it became a colossal
<>Being. It grew up as big as an elephant. Soon it be-
<>came as large as a mountain. Seeing this, Brahma1 and
<>the others stood in amazement. The Boar made a grunt
<>in a loud roaring sound. The people of Janaloka, Satya-
<>loka etc. understood that it was the sound of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. They raised glory and praise to Bhagava1n, who
<>heard all these praises, but without condescending to
<>tell anything, looked at all of them with grace and love,
<>and with a mighty force jumped into the sea. It was
<>immensely troubled by the manes of God Almighty.
<>Varun2a prayed to him to save him from them. Bhagva1n
<>folded his mane and went down to the deep water and
<>made a search for the earth. The Boar walked smelling
<>and snorting and found out the earth. He slowly lifted
<>it on his tusks and started from there. On the way, the
<>fierce and wicked Hiran2ya1ks2a hindered him. Bhagava1n
<>Vis2n2u used his club Nandaka and killed Hiran2ya1ks2a. It
<>was besmeared with his blood; Maha1vis2n2u came up to
<>the surface of water with the earth. He set the earth
<>firm over the water. Thus Brahma1 gave Manu a place
<>in the earth which floated on the water like a lotus-leaf,
<>and empowered him to perform creation.
<NI>3) {%Incarnation of Boar again.%} The goddess Earth, the
<>deity of earth which was raised to the surface of water,
<>fell in love with Maha1vis2n2u and embraced him. He
<>embraced her in return. These mutual embraces conti-
<>nued for one complete Devavars2a (year of God) and
<>consequently the goddess Earth became tired and weak
<>and unconscious. So the earth slid down a little under
<>water. Bhagava1n took the form of a Boar again and
<>lifted the earth to its original place and returned to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 3; Devi1 Bha1gavata
<>Skandhas 8 and 9; Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 5; Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapter 91).

<HI>VARAMAN2I. A beetle made of jewel. Brahma1 had
<>given a boon that only he who fought with this jewel-
<>beetle in his mouth could kill Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a. This [Page827-b+ 64]
<>secret was known only to the giants, such as Ra1van2a.
<>and others. This Varaman2i was kept in an under-
<>ground cell of a harem near the Ka1li1 temple in the
<>Pa1ta1la.
<NI>The battle between Ra1ma and Ra1van2a was going on.
<>Hanu1ma1n made a fort coiling his tail like a spring and
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a stayed inside this fort. While they
<>were sleeping, Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a made a tunnel under the
<>earth and carried away Ra1ma and Laks2man2a. Vibhi1s2an2a
<>knew this, only next day morning. Instantly he sent
<>Hanu1ma1n to Pa1ta1la. In accordance with the advice of
<>Vibhi1s2ana, Hanu1ma1n went directly to the cell in the
<>harem, took Varaman2i and put it in his mouth. Then
<>he fought with Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a and defeated him. Thus
<>with the help of the Varaman2i Hanu1ma1n rescued Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>VARAN2A1. A river famous in the Pura1n2as. It is mention-
<>ed in Va1mana Pura1n2a that the river Varan2a1 which
<>flowed from the right leg and the river Asi1, which
<>started from the left leg of Bhagava1n, who lies in con-
<>templation at Praya1ga, are two holy rivers. (See under
<>Va1ra1n2asi1).
<HI>VA1RAN2A. A country in ancient Bha1rata. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 31,
<>that the army of the Kauravas had surrounded this
<>country.
<HI>VA1RAN2A1SI1 (VA1RA1N2ASI1). Ka1s4i1.
<NI>(Before reading the information given here refer
<>to the details given about Ka1s4i1 under Ka1s4i1 and
<>Divoda1sa).
<NI>1) {%The name Va1ran2a1si1.%} Formerly this place was known
<>as Praya1ga. Later it got the name Va1ran2a1si1 and then
<>Ka1s4i1. The name Va1ran2a1si1 is originated from two rivers.
<>Bhagava1n Yogas4a1yi1 who stays in Praya1ga was born from
<>a portion of Maha1vis2n2u. From the right leg of Yoga-
<>s4a1yi1 the river Varan2a1 started and from his left leg the
<>river Asi1 started. These two rivers are praised and
<>worshipped all over the world. The temple of Yoga-
<>s4a1yi1 is situated in the place between these two rivers.
<>As the place is situated between Varan2a1 and Asi1 it is
<>called Va1ran2a1si. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 3).
<NI>2) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(i) Bhi1s2ma went to Ka1s4i1 and took Amba1, Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1, the daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1, to his
<>kingdom by force. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 102,
<>Stanza 3).
<NI>(ii) Va1ran2a1si1 is a holy place of pilgrimage. By bathing
<>in Kapila1hrada, a holy bath there, and worshipping
<>S4an3kara, one could obtain the fruits of performing
<>the sacrifice Ra1jasu1ya. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 84,
<>Stanza 78).

<>Sam3vartta as his priest. (M.B. As4vamedha Parva,
<>Chapters 6 and 7).
<HI>VA1RAN2A1VATA. The place where Duryodhana built the
<>wax-house for the Pa1n2d2avas. It is believed that the
<>modern village Varn2ava, 19 miles north east to Meerut
<>in North India, is the place where this Pura1n2ic Va1ran2a1-
<>vata stood. Information about Va1ran2a1vata found in
<>Maha1bha1rata, is given below;
<NI>(i) Once the ministers of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra made a con-
<>sultation about the festival in this city. (M.B. A1di

<>Parva, Chapter 95, Stanza 14).
<HI>VARARUCI. An ancient Indian scholar in astronomy
<>and astrology. (Some details regarding Vararuci are
<>given under Bhartr2hari).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} It is stated in Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha-
<>lambaka, Taran3ga 1, that Vararuci was the rebirth of
<>a Gan2ana1yaka (guard of S4iva) named Pus2padanta.
<>Once S4iva happened to tell Pa1rvati1 some previous
<>stories of the Vidya1dharas. Pus2padanta eavesdropped
<>and heard everything. Pa1rvati1 understood this and
<>cursed him to become a man. Accordingly Pus2padanta
<>was born in the city of Kaus4a1mbi1 under the name
<>Vararuci or Ka1tya1yana. (For details about the curse
<>see under Gun2a1d2hya).
<NI>2) {%Of sharp intelligence.%} Vararuci was born as the son
<>of the Brahmin Somadatta at Kaus4a1mbi1. Agni-
<>s4ikha was another name of Somadatta. Vasudatta1
<>was the mother of Vararuci. In the previous birth,
<>Vasudatta1 was a hermit maid. Due to a curse she
<>lost her hermit-maidhood and took birth as a woman
<>under the name Vasudatta1 and became the wife of
<>Somadatta.
<NI>As his father died in his childhood, Vararuci was
<>brought up by his mother. She was in great penury
<>after the death of her husband. One day two travellers
<>came to her house. While they were sitting on the
<>veranda, the sound of a conch was heard. Then the
<>mother called Vararuci and said to him. “Son, the
<>dance of Nanda, the friend of your father, is about to
<>begin.” Vararuci requested his mother to let him go
<>to the temple and see the dance so that he might learn
<>it. Hearing this, the guests were amazed. How can
<>one learn dance by seeing only once? That was the
<>doubt in the minds of the travellers. “Vararuci could
<>learn anything by hearing only once,” his mother
<>said. As a test, they recited to him a portion from the
<>Vedas. Vararuci repeated the portion to them without
<>any mistake. After this the guests took the boy and [Page828-b+ 65]
<>showed him the dance and brought him back. The boy
<>performed every item of the dance he saw, before the
<>guests. They were immensely pleased.
<NI>3) {%Getting a teacher.%} The guests had actually been
<>searching for a boy who could understand anything at
<>the first hearing. There was reason for it.
<NI>In the great city of Nandara1ja, there was a great
<>Brahmin named S4an3karasva1mi1. He had two sons
<>named Vars2a and Upavars2a. Both married and lived in
<>separate houses. By and by Vars2a became cruel and
<>wicked and poor. Upavars2a became learned and
<>wealthy. The rainy season approached. In those days
<>it was a custom for women to make a sweet food of rice
<>flour with sugar and give it to cruel Brahmins. It was
<>to prevent the extreme cold in the winter and the ex-
<>treme heat in the summer from affecting them severely.
<>The wife of Upavars2a made this sweet food and gave it
<>to Vars2a. When he brought it home, his wife scolded
<>him. Vars2a felt very sorry because of his foolishness.
<>He gave up all his desires and began to worship
<>Kuma1rasva1mi1. Kuma1rasva1mi1 was pleased with him
<>and blessed him with all kinds of knowledge. Kuma1ra-
<>sva1mi1 had ordered him to teach all of this knowledge
<>to one who could learn at first hearing. From that day
<>onwards Vars2a had been waiting for a disciple who
<>could learn at first hearing.
<NI>During this period there lived two Brahmins named
<>Devasva1mi1 and Karambhaka in the city of Vetasapura.
<>They were friends. A son was born to each of them.
<>The son of Devasva1mi1 was named Vya1li1. The name of
<>the son of Karambhaka was Indradatta. When Vya1li1
<>was a child, his father died. Seeing their grief the
<>father of Indradatta left the country. Both of the boys,
<>having nobody to look after them, went to perform
<>penance, before Subrahman2yasva1mi1. Subrahman2ya
<>ordered them in their sleep to go to Vars2a in Pa1t2alika1,
<>the city of King Nanda, and to learn every thing from
<>him. The boys immediately went to the city of King
<>Nanda and enquired about the teacher Vars2a. The
<>people told them that Vars2a was a fool. They were
<>sorry to hear it. Still they did not turn back. They
<>reached the house of Vars2a, and entered the house which
<>was the abode of rats and bats, the walls of which were
<>crumbling due to rain as it had not been thatched for
<>a long time. The courtyard was full of Cassiatora
<>plants. Inside the house, here and there on the floor,
<>Cyperus-grass was growing. The wife of Vars2a who was
<>in utter penury stood up and welcomed them. She told
<>them about her husband. “He is waiting for a disciple
<>who would learn everything at first hearing.” Vya1li1
<>and Indradatta agreed to bring such a disciple and
<>they started on a journey in search of such a boy. They
<>were the two travellers who came to the house of
<>Vararuci.
<NI>Vya1li1 said all about these things to the mother of
<>Vararuci. She was very glad and said. “Everything
<>fits well. At the birth of my son, an ethereal
<>voice said: “At first hearing he will learn every-
<>thing. He will learn everything from the teacher
<>Vars2a. He will publish works in grammar and astro-
<>nomy.” If he has interest in good things he will get the
<>name Vararuci. So I had been thinking how and where
<>to find this teacher Vars2a.”
<NI>Next morning, with the permission of his mother,
<>Vararuci started for the house of Vars2a, with Vya1li1 and [Page829-a+ 65]
<>Indradatta. They reached the house of Vars2a. Next
<>morning they smeared and purified the floor and the
<>three sincere and simple disciples sat facing the east.
<>The teacher Vars2a recited to them the divine spell
<>‘Om,’ and instantly all the Vedas and the ancillaries of
<>Vedas made their appearance. The teacher commenced
<>teaching. The three disciples learned, Vararuci
<>hearing only once, Vya1li1 hearing twice and Indradatta
<>hearing thrice. Hearing these divine recitations and
<>repetitions which were not to be heard anywhere else,
<>Brahmins crowded to the place. King Nanda of
<>Pa1t2ali1putra praised the teacher Vars2a and sent him
<>plenty of wealth and conferred on him ranks and
<>privileges.
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} Vararuci learned everything from the
<>teacher Vars2a. He went with his friends once to see
<>the Indra-festival. There, Vararuci happened to see
<>Upakos4a1 the daughter of Upavars2a and fell in love
<>with her. That night he did not sleep. At last he slow-
<>ly closed his eyes. A divine woman clad in white
<>garments appeared before him It seemed to him that
<>the woman said to him. “You need not worry in this
<>matter. Upakos4a1 was your wife in the previous birth.
<>She will marry only you. I am Sarasvati1 who pervades
<>your body.” Vararuci woke up. Next day the elders
<>came to know of this, and gave her in marriage to
<>Vararuci.
<NI>5) {%Vararuci becoming a Minister.%} Education was finished.
<>It was time for Vya1li1 and Indradatta to give presents
<>to the teacher Vars2a. The teacher demanded a crore
<>of Vilkas (a Venetian ducat used for neck-ornament).
<>They were not having so much wealth. They went
<>with Vararuci to Nanda, the King of Ayodhya1, and the
<>Brother-in-law of Vararuci. When they reached Ayodhya1,
<>they heard that the King had just died. Indradatta
<>said “By the practice of contemplation I shall enter the
<>body of the King. Vararuci should come and beg money
<>of me. Till my return Vya1li1 must keep my body.”
<NI>“The spirit of Indradatta immediately entered the
<>King's body. The dead King rose up. People were
<>struck with wonder. They celebrated a festival. Vya1li1
<>kept the body of Indradatta within a temple. Vararuci
<>went to the presence of the King and begged for a
<>crore of Vilkas. The King called his minister S4akat2a1la
<>and told him to give Vararuci a crore of Vilkas.
<>S4akat2a1la, who was an intelligent man, felt some doubt
<>in the coming to life of the King. He decided that some
<>one might have entered the body of the King. He
<>ordered that every dead body in the city should be
<>burnt. Along with the bodies, the body of Indradatta
<>also was taken by force from Vya1li1. At this time the
<>King compelled S4akat2a1la to give the beggar Vilkas.
<>But till the dead bodies were burnt, S4akat2a1la did not
<>obey him. Because his body was burnt Indradatta had
<>to remain in the body of the King. S4akat2a1la gave Vara-
<>ruci the required amount. But of what use was the
<>money? Indradatta had become the King. The King
<>and Vya1li1 made a secret consultation, as a result of
<>which Vararuci was made the Prime Minister. S4akat2a1la
<>was charged with Brahmahatya1 and was put into a
<>dungeon with his hundred sons. They were allowed
<>fried and powdered grain and a ‘ceratu’ (a measure)
<>of water as food for each.
<NI>S4akat2a1la said to his sons. “My sons, all of us cannot
<>live with so little food. The most intelligent one among [Page829-b+ 65]
<>us should live by eating the whole food, to take revenge
<>on the Yoga Nanda King. Who will do so?”
<NI>Sons:--We don't think that we are powerful to do that.
<NI>So you must live, father!
<NI>So S4akat2a1la ate the whole food and lived while his sons,
<>one by one, died of hunger before his eyes. S4akat2a1la
<>sat in the middle of the Skeletons with the sole purpose
<>of taking revenge. Vya1li1 gave the present to the teacher
<>and went home.
<NI>Indradatta and Vararuci lived as king and minister.
<NI>6) {%Loss of ministership.%} By and by Indradatta had fallen
<>into bad ways. The subjects were beset with famine.
<>The people hated the king and the minister. They made
<>a cry to bring S4akat2a1la back. They obtained the per-
<>mission of the king and brought S4akat2a1la out of the
<>dungeon. S4akat2a1la knew that so long as Vararuci was
<>alive, he could do nothing to the King Yoga Nanda. So
<>he decided to wait for an opportunity, and accepted
<>an office under Vararuci. One day Yoga Nanda went
<>out for a walk. He saw in the Ganges the palm of a
<>hand with five fingers. He called Vararuci and asked
<>him what the sight was. Vararuci showed two fingers
<>in that direction. Immediately the palm of the hand
<>disappeared. The King was amazed at this and asked
<>him for its meaning. He said “The meaning of showing
<>fingers was that if five men unite together, they could
<>accomplish anything. I showed two fingers, to mean that
<>if two men unite together they also could achieve any-
<>thing.” At this reply the king was much pleased and
<>S4akat2a1la felt miserable at the intelligence of Vararuci.
<NI>On another occasion the King saw his wife looking at a
<>Brahmin guest through the window. He got angry and
<>ordered that Brahmin to be killed. When that Brahmin
<>was being taken to the scaffold, a dead fish, placed for
<>sale, laughed loud. The king asked Vararuci for its
<>reason. Saying that he had to consider about it before
<>giving a reply, he went out and meditated upon Sara-
<>svati1. Devi1 appeared and told him. “If you climb up to
<>the top of this palm tree and sit there to night you will
<>understand why the dead fish laughed.” Vararuci did
<>as he was told. A fierce giantess came there with her
<>young ones. The children began to ask her for food.
<>The giantess told them that they would get the flesh of
<>a Brahmin next day, and that he was not killed that day
<>because the dead fish had laughed. The young ones
<>asked her why the dead fish laughed. The giantess said
<>“The wives of the kings are not chaste. In all harems
<>men live in the guise of women. Without stopping this
<>the king was going to kill an innocent Brahmin. That
<>is why the dead fish laughed.”
<NI>Vararuci, who heard this conversation, got down when
<>the giantess was gone. He went to the king and told
<>him why the fish laughed. The king made a sudden
<>search in the harem. He found out some men in the
<>dress of women. The king honoured Vararuci and
<>released the Brahmin. One day an artist who drew
<>portraits, came to the palace. He drew a portrait of
<>the king and the queen and placed it before the king.
<>The picture was life-like. The king gave the artist
<>several presents. Once Vararuci happened to enter the
<>bed-room of the king. He saw the picture on the wall.
<>The picture was beautiful. Still, considering the appear-
<>ance of each part of her body the queen ought to have
<>a mole on her loin. Vararuci put that mole in the
<>picture. When Vararuci had gone the king entered the [Page830-a+ 65]
<>room and saw the mole in the picture. The kingasked his
<>servant, who that person was who had put that mole in
<>the picture. He replied that it was Vararuci. The king
<>thought that Vararuci had nocturnal connections with
<>the queen. Perhaps it was in this way that Vararuci
<>found out men in the dress of women. The king called
<>S4akat2a1la to him and told him to kill Vararuci secretly.
<>S4akat2a1la felt pity on Vararuci and hid him in a place.
<>Vararuci told S4akat2a1la “No body can kill me. My
<>friend is a giant. He will come to me the moment
<>think of him. If I tell him he will swallow the whole
<>world.” When he heard this, S4akat2a1la desired to see
<>the giant. Vararuci thought of him and the giant
<>appeared. S4akat2a1la was terribly afraid of the giant.
<>Vararuci made him disappear. S4akat2a1la asked him how
<>he got the friendship of the giant. Vararuci replied.
<NI>“While you were in the dungeon, a city chief was disap-
<>pearing daily from this city. The king asked me to find
<>out the reason. One night, while I was walking through
<>the city, I saw this giant. He asked me. “Who is the
<>most beautiful woman in this city?” I replied “Whoever
<>falls in love with a woman, to him, that woman is the
<>most beautiful. You who do not know this principle,
<>are a fool.” The giant had no answer. He said “You
<>alone have defeated me. I am glad of it. The moment
<>you think of me I will come and help you.” Saying
<>this the giant disappeared. Thenceforward we became
<>friends.”
<NI>S4akat2a1la felt great respect for Vararuci. Hiran2yagupta,
<>the son of Yoga Nanda, went for hunting. His horse ran
<>fast and he was separated from his army and got into
<>a deep forest far away. He ate some fruits and plums
<>and got on a tree to rest for the night. At that time a
<>lion chased a bear, which climbed on the same tree.
<>The prince trembled with fear. The bear said “Do not
<>fear. I am your friend.” Both talked for a while and
<>became fast friends. Shortly, the prince began to sleep.
<>The lion asked the bear to push that man down. The
<>bear said that he would not deceive his friend. The dis-
<>appointed lion sat under the tree. Then the bear slept
<>and Hiran2yagupta sat awake. The lion asked the prince
<>to push the bear down. Thinking that he could save
<>his life by complying with the request of the lion, he
<>pushed the bear down. Fortunately the hold of the bear
<>was firm and so it did not fall. The bear cursed Hiran2ya-
<>gupta. “May you become mad.” The king was very
<>sorry when his son returned a mad man. The king
<>repented that he had killed Vararuci. For this was the
<>time when the king needed him most.
<NI>S4akat2a1la went to the presence of the king and said that
<>Vararuci was still alive. In accordance with the order
<>of the king, S4akat2a1la brought Vararuci. The king
<>showed him his mad son. By the blessing of Sarasvati1,
<>Vararuci understood that the prince had deceived his
<>friend, and informed the king of what had happened.
<>Immediately the prince was cured of his madness. Yoga
<>Nanda asked Vararuci, how he knew the cause of the
<>madness of the prince. He replied. “A man of intelli-
<>gence can understand anything by symptoms and in-
<>ference.” He also said that in this way he knew about
<>the mole of the queen. When the king heard this he
<>bowed down his head.
<NI>After this Vararuci left the palace. He did not stop to
<>accept the favours of the king. Nor did he pay any heed
<>to the compulsion of the king to stay. He reached his [Page830-b+ 65]
<>house. Everybody who saw Vararuci began to cry. Not
<>knowing the reason, he stood dumbfounded. Upavars2a
<>came to him and said that when the news about the
<>slaughter of Vararuci reached home, Upakos4a1 got in-
<>to fire and his mother died of broken heart. The grief-
<>stricken Vararuci went to the forest for penance.
<NI>After this S4akat2a1la waited for an opportunity to bring
<>Indradatta (Yoga Nanda) down. Once he had been
<>walking out side the city when he saw a Brahmin dig-
<>ging a pit. S4akat2a1la asked him why he was digging the
<>pit. He replied “I stumbled on this Darbha grass. So
<>I am rooting it out.” S4akat2a1la resolved to make use of
<>this Brahmin to achieve his purpose. His name was
<>Ca1n2akya. S4akat2a1la took Ca1n2akya to the palace. A
<>ceremony of offerings to the manes was being conducted
<>in the Palace. Another Brahmin named Subandhu
<>also came there. The king ordered ‘agrabhojana’ (first
<>meal) to be given to Subandhu. Ca1n2akya trembled
<>with fury. At that time his lock of hair was loosened.
<>He took a vow that only after pacifying his anger by
<>killing Yoga Nanda within seven days, would he tie up
<>his lock. Ca1n2akya began practising sorcery against the
<>king. The king caught burning fever and died on the
<>seventh day. S4akat2a1la killed Hiran2yagupta. After this
<>Sakat2a1la made Candragupta, the son of the real Nanda
<>who died earlier, the king. Making Ca1n2akya his minis-
<>ter, S4akat2a1la went for penance.
<NI>7) {%Sons.%} See under Pa1kkana1r.
<NI>8) {%The end.%} Vararuci began to perform penance in the
<>Vindhya mountain. At that time a brahmin came to
<>the hermitage of Vararuci. He informed Vararuci of
<>the death of Yoga Nanda. Thinking about the littleness
<>of the pleasures of the world, he began to walk through
<>the Vindhya mountain when he saw the devil called
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti. Telling everything to the devil Ka1n2abhu1ti,
<>Vararuci started for Badarya1s4rama to discard his body.
<>On the way he saw a hermit who lived on water alone.
<>In the meanwhile his finger was cut with the tip of
<>Darbha grass and blood oozed from the wound. Vara-
<>ruci, by his attainments, changed the blood into the
<>juice of a pot-herb. The hermit cried out “Oh, I have
<>become a man of attainments.” With a laugh
<>Vararuci said “You have not yet overcome your egoism.
<>I did so to test you. First of all you must overcome
<>your egoism and become wise.”
<NI>After saying this Vararuci went to Badarya1s4rama and
<>reached there. He did penance there and Devi1 appear-
<>ed. According to her advice he made a fire by contem-
<>plation and burned his body in it. Then Vararuci
<>became the old Pus2padanta and went to the presence
<>of S4iva.
<HI>VARASTRI1. A sister of Br2haspati. The Vasu named
<>Prabha1sa married Varastri1. This woman who was an
<>expounder of the Vedas, pervaded all the creations by
<>the power of harmony with the Supreme Spirit. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 60, Stanza 96: Va1yu Pura1n2a, 84,
<>15).
<HI>VARATANTU. The preceptor of a hermit called
<>Kautsa. (See under Kautsa).
<HI>VARATANU. A King of the Kurus. Because of his sin-
<>ful deeds in the previous birth he was denied the happi-
<>ness of getting children in the next birth. In the rebirth
<>his name was S4ri1dhara. He lived with his wife Prabha1-
<>vati1 for a long time, but did not get children. When
<>the hermit Vya1sa came to his palace once, the King [Page831-a+ 65]
<>asked him for the reason of his remaining childless.
<>Vya1sa replied “Oh King, hear why you have only
<>one wife and why you do not get children. In the
<>previous birth you had been a brahmin named Vara-
<>tanu. Your wife was called S4an3kari1. When both of you
<>were going somewhere once, you happened to see a low-
<>caste child falling into water. Without paying any heed
<>to it, you went on your way. The child was drowned.
<>Though both of you have taken births in royal families
<>due to the several good deeds of yours, you have become
<>childless because of that one sinful act.”
<NI>According to the instruction of Vya1sa, he gave Brah-
<>mins alms of gold, clothes, oxen, pumpkin etc. and
<>performed Ba1la vrata, the rite for the sake of children.
<>Thus he got remission of his sin. Within a year he got
<>a son loved and respected by everyone. That handsome
<>prince became an emperor who came to be the founder
<>of a dynasty. (Padma Pura1n2a, Brahma Khan2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 6).
<HI>VARATRI. One of the four sons of S4uka. The other
<>three were, Pr2thuras4mi, Br2hadan3giras and Rajata.
<>Devendra killed them because they were against sacrifice.
<>It is stated in Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a that after a while
<>from the severed heads of these sons date palm trees
<>grew up.
<HI>VARAYU. A King born in the family of Mahaujas.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74, Stanza 15).
<HI>VARCAS I. Son of Soma, one of the eight Vasus.
<>Manohara1 was the mother of Varcas. Abhimanyu, the
<>son of Arjuna was the next birth of Varcas. (For
<>further details see under Abhimanyu).
<HI>VARCAS II. The son of Sucetas, a Brahmin born in
<>the family of Gr2tsamada. This Varcas had a son called
<>Vihavya. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 30, Stanza
<>61).
<HI>VA1RDHAKS2EMI. A mighty King of Vr2s2n2i dynasty.
<>The following details about him are taken from Maha1-

<HI>VARGA1. A celestial maid. There is a story in Maha1-

<>and her friends were changed into crocodiles and had
<>to live in water for a long time.
<NI>Once there lived an ‘apsaras’ (celestial maid) named
<>Varga1 in Deva1ran2ya. She had four friends called
<>Saurabheyi1, Sami1ci1, Budbuda1 and Lata1. Once they were
<>going to the house of Kubera their patron. On the way
<>they saw a hermit. They saw the whole forest
<>shining with the radiance of the power of penance
<>of the hermit. They decided to entice the hermit [Page831-b+ 65]
<>somehow. With this intention they entered
<>his hermitage. Seeing their dalliance and co-
<>quetry, the hermit got angry and cursed them to
<>become crocodiles for a hundred years. They implored
<>him with tears, for liberation from the curse. The
<>hermit told them that in due course a noble man would
<>come and get them out of water and that then they
<>would obtain their original form. They walked towards
<>a lake.
<NI>On the way they saw Na1rada. They told him every-
<>thing. He told them. “On the coast of the southern
<>ocean there are five ti1rthas (holy baths) known as
<>Agastya, Saubhadra, Pauloma, Ka1randhama and
<>Suprasanna. You may go to these lakes and live there
<>as crocodiles one in each. In due course Arjuna, the son
<>of Pa1n2d2u will come and redeem you.”
<NI>According to the words of Na1rada the five celestial
<>maids walked to the south and reached the Pan5cati1rtha
<>(the five holy baths) and each of them entered a lake
<>as a crocodile. After this nobody dared to live near
<>those holy baths. After some time Arjuna started on his
<>pilgrimage. He passed through many places and reach-
<>ed the Pan5cati1rtha. He enquired why the place was
<>forsaken by people. The hermits told him that there
<>was a crocodile in each of the five baths and that they
<>would eat anybody who got into the bath. Arjuna got
<>into a lake. Immediately a crocodile came and caught
<>hold of him. With great difficulty he dragged it out of
<>the lake. Instantly the crocodile changed into a beauti-
<>ful damsel. The celestial maid Varga1 told the amazed
<>Arjuna her story and she added that her four friends
<>were lying in the neighbouring four lakes. Arjuna redeem-
<>ed every one of them. After this, Varga1 and her
<>friends went to Deva1ran2ya and Arjuna to Man2alu1ra.
<>From that day onwards the five ti1rthas came to be known
<>as Na1ri1ti1rthas.

<>thousand years. Varis2t2ha and Gr2tsamada, as friends of
<>Indra were present at the sacrifice. Gr2tsamada committ-
<>ed some mistakes in the recitation of Sa1mans. Varis2t2ha

<>Varun2a as the guardian of the western zone. Vais4ravan2a
<>once did penance before Brahma1, and when Brahma1
<>appeared before him, he made a request that he should
<>be appointed as one of the guardians of the quarters.
<>Brahma1 replied. “I have already selected Indra, Varun2a
<>and Yama as guardians of the points. I was thinking
<>who, the fourth, should be, when you came. So from
<>this day onwards, Indra shall be the guardian of the
<>East, Yama that of the South, Varun2a, that of the

<>er of the elements. The semen of Varun2a fell on
<>Valmi1ka (White-ant-hill) from which the great hermit
<>Va1lmi1ki was born. Besides them, Daks2asa1varn2i, the
<>ninth Manu was the son of Varun2a. Pus2kara was an-
<>other son of Varun2a. The handsome Pus2kara was
<>received as husband by the daughter of Soma (Can-
<>dra). Vandi1, who was defeated by the hermit As2t2a1-
<>vakra at the palace of Janaka was the son of Varun2a.

<>decided to perform a sacrifice. He made all prepara-
<>tions. But he did not get the required cow at the sti-
<>pulated time. So he got the Homadhenu of Varun2a
<>by theft and began to perform the ya1ga (sacrifice).
<>Varun2a knew this. Instantly he went to Kas4yapa and
<>demanded his cow. But Kas4yapa refused to return the
<>cow. Varun2a complained to Brahma1, who sent for
<>Kas4yapa and asked him about the cow and both
<>Brahma1 and Varun2a cursed Kas4yapa that he who had
<>taken the cow by stealth would take birth as a cowherd
<>in Amba1d2i. (For further details see under Kas4yapa

<NI>i) {%First birth.%}
<NI>a) {%Birth.%} Vasis2t2ha is one of the mental sons of Brahma1.
<>This is the first birth of Vasis2t2ha.
<NI>“Na1rada was born from the lap, Daks2a was born from
<>the right thumb, Vasis2t2ha from the breath (pra1n2a)
<>Bhr2gu from the skin, Kratu from the hand of Brahma1.”
<NI>In this birth, Arundhati1 was the wife of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Arundhati1 was known by the name U1rja1 also. There is
<>a Pura1n2ic story behind the marriage of Vasis2t2ha and
<>Arundhati1.
<NI>In her previous birth the name of Arundhati1 was
<>Sandhya1. She was born from the passion of Brahma1.
<>As soon as she was born she grew up. Seeing her exqui-
<>site beauty the Praja1patis were filled with excitement.
<>Even Brahma1, her father, was some-what excited at her
<>sight. S4iva, who understood this, teased Brahma1.
<>Sandhya1 was ashamed. Even after S4iva, Brahma1, Pra-
<>ja1patis and the others had gone their ways, she remained
<>there blaming her birth. She said to herself: “The mo-
<>ment I was born, I grew up to be a young woman. My
<>father and my brothers looked at me with desire. I
<>also looked at them excitedly. As an atonement for
<>this sin, I will burn my body in fire. I do not want a
<>body desired by my father and brothers. With this
<>decision she went to the mountain Candrabha1ga, which
<>is the source of the river Candrabha1ga1, and began to
<>perform penance. Brahma1 who came to know of this, [Page834-b+ 65]
<>was filled with pity and sent Vasis2t2ha to her. He went
<>there in the form of a Brahmin boy and taught her how
<>to perform penance. After the return of Vasis2t2ha she con-
<>tinued the severe penance to Vis2n2u. Her penance became
<>the subject of talk and wonder everywhere. After a short
<>while Vis2n2u appeared before her sitting on his convey-
<>ance Garud2a. She praised Vis2n2u. Vis2n2u was pleased
<>with her and asked what her desire was. She said:
<>“Lord, creatures should not be sexually excited at their
<>birth. They should have sexual desire only when they
<>are grown up. The three worlds must know that I am
<>chaste. In all my births I should not look at anybody
<>except my husband with sexual desire. The man who
<>looks at me with sexual desire should lose his manliness
<>and become a hermaphrodite.”
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u agreed to her request. It was from that day
<>onwards that sexual desire appeared in creatures in
<>their grown-up stage only, after they have passed the
<>stages of infancy and childhood. Maha1vis2n2u told her.
<>“It is preordained that this body of yours will be burnt
<>in fire. Medha1tithi, (Megha1tithi), the son of Priyavrata
<>is performing the great sacrifice called Jyotis2t2oma which
<>is to be completed in twelve years. It is coming to a
<>close. There is none equal to him because of this sacri-
<>fice. That great hermit's sacrifice is being performed in
<>the basin of this river Candrabha1ga1. Unseen by the
<>hermits, you should go there and get into the fire. Be-
<>cause of my blessing you will be born from that fire as
<>the daughter of Medha1tithi. You should go into the fire
<>thinking of him whom you want to be your husband in
<>this birth.”
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u touched Sandhya1 with the tip of his finger.
<>Sandhya1 walked to the sacrificial hall. Seen by none,
<>she got down into the fire. She was burnt in the blaz-
<>ing fire. By the order of Vis2n2u; the God fire placed
<>Sandhya1 who was burnt in the sacrificial fire, in the
<>Solar region. The sun divided that body into two and
<>placed them in his chariot. The upper portion became
<>the pra1tassandhya1 (dawn) between the day and the
<>night and the lower portion became the Sa1yantana
<>Sandhya1 (the evening twilight). At the end of the
<>sacrifice, from the centre of the sacrificial fire a girl,
<>like the flame of fire rose up. Medha1tithi took that
<>child in his hands and called her Arundhati1. The child
<>became famous throughout the three worlds, as the
<>name stood for the principle that on no reason what-so-
<>ever will righteousness be obstructed. (Rodha means
<>obstruction. So Arundhati1 is one who cannot be obstruct-
<>ed). In some other Pura1n2as Arundhati1 is given as
<>the daughter of Praja1pati Kardama and Devahu1ti.
<NI>b) {%Marriage.%} Arundhati1 grew up in the hermitage
<>of Medha1tithi. Candrabha1ga1 holy bath which was the
<>playfield of Arundhati1, is even today, known as Arun-
<>dhati1ti1rtha. Arundhati1 became five years of age. Brahma1
<>saw her when she was playing on the ground after hav-
<>ing taken her bath. At the instruction of Brahma1,
<>Arundhati1 was entrusted to Sa1vitri1 and Bahula1 for
<>education. Sa1vitri1 is the wife of the Sun. Arundhati1
<>lived in Ma1nasa lake with Sa1vitri1, Ga1yatri1, Bahula1,
<>Sarasvati1, Drupada1 and such other celestial women
<>and completed her education. One day Arundhati1
<>happened to see Vasis2t2ha who was shining with radi-
<>ance. They fell in love with each other. Parents and
<>relatives and the elders came to know of this. Sa1vitri
<>patting Arundhati1 blessed her to become the wife of [Page835-a+ 64]
<>Vasis2t2ha. The marriage of Arundhati1 with Vasis2t2ha was
<>conducted in the presence of the Gods.
<NI>c) {%Sons.%} Seven sons, named Citraketu, Purocis, Viraca,
<>Mitra, Ulban2a, Vasubhr2dya1na and Dyuma1n were born
<>to Vasis2t2ha by Arundhati1. All the seven of them were
<>Brahmars2is.
<NI>{%d) The meaning of the names Vasis2t2ha and Arundhati1.%} The
<>meaning of the name Vasis2t2ha is given by Vasis2t2ha
<>himself as follows:--
<NI>I am known as Vasis2t2ha for two reasons. I am ‘Vasu-
<>ma1n’. The S4rutis say that Air, Earth etc. are Vasus.
<>I have become Vasis2t2ha because I have brought under
<>control the Vasus beginning with An2ima1 (the power
<>of reducing the body to an atom). See what Arun-
<>dhati1 herself says, about the meaning of the name
<>Arundhati1.
<NI>“I consider mountains, earth and heaven as elements
<>in which I live, only after considering my hus-
<>band as the element in which I live. My husband
<>is the first and foremost element in my life. Moreover
<>I conform (anurodha) with the mind of my husband.
<>So know me as Arundhati1.”
<NI>{%e) Conjugal fidelity of Arundhati1.%} The Saptars2is (the seven
<>hermits) once left Arundhati1 alone in a forest and went
<>to the Mountain Hima1layas to gather fruits and roots.
<>In those days, due to severe summer, the earth
<>became a wilderness. So the hermits lived in the
<>Hima1layas. Arundhati1 all alone did penance in the
<>forest. On one day S4iva took the form of a Brahmin and
<>going near Arundhati1 requested her for alms. She rep-
<>lied: “There are only Ziziphus fruits here, and nothing
<>else to eat.” The Brahmin asked her to boil them. She
<>placed the pot of Ziziphus fruits on the oven and sat
<>there hearing the good stories told by the Brahmin. Thus
<>without thinking about her hunger or thirst she sat there
<>for twelve years hearing the stories narrated by the
<>Brahmin. When the hermits returned from Hima1layas,
<>S4iva assumed his original form and said, “Hermits!
<>This woman, sitting in the hermitage, has acquired
<>more penance than you have acquired in the Hima1layas.
<>Good woman! What boon do you want?” She
<>requested that that place should be known as the holy
<>place called ‘Badarapacana (cooking of Ziziphus fruits).
<>S4iva allowed it. Even today that place is considered
<>a holy place.
<NI>f) {%Death.%} When so many devas were dead at the sacri-
<>fice of Daks2a, Vasis2t2ha also died along with them.
<>Arundhati1 followed her husband. After death both of
<>them entered the firmament and became two stars.
<NI>g) {%Seeing Arundhati1.%} In India there is a custom of show-
<>ing the women, the star Arundhati1. Arundhati1 is the
<>first of the women who took only one husband in her life.
<>The meaning of this custom is this that this mentality of
<>Arundhati1 should be acquired by the married women
<>of India. Moreover, if the star stands in front of the star
<>Vasis2t2ha, it is considered to forebode calamities in the
<>world. (Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a).
<NI>ii) {%Second birth.%}
<NI>{%General information.%} Vasis2t2ha who died at the sacrifice
<>of Daks2a took birth again from the sacrificial fire of
<>Brahma1. Aks2ama1la1 was the wife of this Vasis2t2ha.
<>Aks2ama1la1 was the rebirth of Arundhati1. So, in some
<>Pura1n2as, both are shown as one. This birth of Vasis2-
<>t2ha was terminated by the curse of emperor Nimi of [Page835-b+ 65]
<>the Iks2va1ku dynasty. (For details see under Nimi).
<NI>(iii) {%Third birth.%} In the third birth Vasis2t2ha was born
<>from a pot as the son of Mitra1varun2as. In this birth
<>Vasis2t2ha was the brother of Agastya. (For detailed
<>story see under Agastya, para 2). In this birth the
<>wife of Vasis2t2ha was an Arundhati1, who was the sister
<>of Na1rada. Thus according to the Pura1n2as, it took
<>three births for Vasis2t2ha to complete his life. It is
<>difficult to ascertain, in which particular birth, a parti-
<>cular story, stated in the Pura1n2as, took place. It is
<>probable that a large number of episodes might have
<>taken place in the second and third births.
<NI>Stories connected with the life of Vasis2t2ha are given
<>below:
<NI>2) {%Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra.%} Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra
<>were two herm its who quarrelled with each other through-
<>out their lives. The quarrel between Vasis2t2ha a
<>Brahmin hermit and Vis4va1mitra a royal hermit, is
<>given below:
<NI>(i) {%Reason for the enmity.%} Vis4va1mitra was a King who
<>cared much for the welfare of his subjects. Once he
<>went with his army to hunt. He became tired by the
<>hunt and reached the hermitage of Vasis2t2ha who
<>welcomed them with hospitality. He told them that
<>food would be ready when they returned after a bath.
<>The King and his men bathed quickly and when they
<>returned, a grand feast was ready for so many thou-
<>sands. The King was in great perplexity. After the
<>meals Vis4va1mitra approached the hermit Vasis2t2ha
<>and asked him how he got such a grand feast ready.
<>He replied that the cow Ka1madhenu in his hermitage was
<>capable of granting any wish. The king desired to have
<>the cow. He asked the hermit to exchange the cow for
<>a crore of ordinary cows. Vasis2t2ha did not agree to
<>this. Vis4va1mitra said that the noble and superior
<>things of the country belonged to the King. The hermit
<>did not agree to that also. Finally Vis4va1mitra was
<>about to take away the cow by force. Thus the quarrel
<>began. Understanding the wish of Vasis2t2ha Ka1madhenu
<>held her horns and tail up and stood as a fierce
<>and cruel figure. From the various limbs of the cow so
<>many thousands of warriors jumped out and a fierce
<>battle ensued in which the hundred sons and the huge
<>army of Vis4va1mitra met with defeat. At last Vis4va1mitra
<>tried to launch a direct attack against Vasis2t2ha. But
<>the arrows of Vis4va1mitra were changed to flowers when
<>they touched the body of Vasis2t2ha. At last the King
<>admitted that the power of the penance of a Brahmin
<>hermit was the real power and he admitted defeat from
<>Vasis2t2ha. From that day onwards a deep-rooted,
<>hatred against Vasis2t2ha arose in the heart of Vis4va1mitra.
<>He left the administration of his Kingdom in the hands
<>of his relatives and went to the south where he erected
<>a hermitage and began to do severe penance. He acquir-
<>ed great powers of penance and became a royal hermit
<>of immense attainments and the quarrel between the
<>two great hermits Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra began.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, 5 sargas from 51).
<NI>(ii) {%Second confrontation.%} The next contest between the two
<>hermits was due to the king Tris4an3ku of the Solar
<>dynasty. Tris4an3ku wanted bodily attainment of heaven.
<>Vasis2t2ha tried to discourage the king. Vis4va1mitra took
<>up the matter. He began to perform a sacrifice to lift
<>up the king bodily to heaven, and Tris4an3ku began to
<>rise up higher and higher. But Indra did not allow him [Page836-a+ 65]
<>to enter bodily into the heaven. At last Vis4va1mitra, by
<>the power of his penance created an artificial heaven
<>midway between the heaven and the earth and placed
<>Tris4an3ku in that heaven. With this the gap between
<>the two hermits widened. (For more details see under
<>Tris4an3ku).
<NI>(iii) {%Third confrontation.%} By the blessing of Varun2a, a son
<>named Lohita was born to Haris4candra. He had promis-
<>ed Varun2a to sacrifice his son Lohita. But Lohita
<>came to know of this and he left the palace. Haris4can-
<>dra was in a difficult situation. Vasis2t2ha advised him
<>to buy a son and to sacrifice him. Accordingly a Brah-
<>min boy named S4unas4s4epha was bought. Vasis2t2ha
<>decided to sacrifice him. Vis4va1mitra said that he could
<>not be sacrificed. Haris4candra was loved by Vasis2t2ha.
<>So Vis4va1mitra tried to harm him as far as possible.
<>Haris4candra fell in the trap of Vi1s4va1mitra and lost his
<>country, city, wite, everything and had to live in funeral
<>places. (For detailed story see under Haris4candra.)
<NI>(iv) {%Fourth confrontation.%} Vasis2t2ha did not like the
<>deception practised by Vis4va1mitra, on Haris4candra.
<>Once Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha met in the forest by
<>chance. Vasis2t2ha scolded Vis4va1mitra, who had only
<>the guise of a hermit, thus: “You wicked Vis4va1mitra!
<>Why do you put the truthful Haris4candra into so much
<>misery? You are deceiving him as the stork sits in
<>meditation and deceives the fish. So you will become
<>a stork.”
<NI>Vis4va1mitra looked at the hermit Vasis2t2ha who had
<>cursed him and said. “So long as I am a stork you
<>shall be Kingfisher. Thus they cursed each other.
<NI>Both of them became birds and went to the shore of
<>Ma1nasa lake and each building a nest on the top of
<>trees began to live there. There was nothing but quar-
<>rel between the two birds daily. Both pecked and
<>scratched each other to such an extent that they were
<>covered with bleeding wounds. They looked like an
<>Erythrina tree filled with flowers. Everybody who saw
<>them was filled with sadness. Thus they lived there
<>for a long time.
<NI>Once the Kind-hearted Brahma1, the father of Vasis2t2ha,
<>saw their sorry plight. Having pity on them he came
<>there with the other gods and delivered them both
<>from the curse. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 6).
<NI>(v) {%Fifth confrontation.%} Vis4va1mitra called the river
<>Sarasvati1 and asked her to bring Vasis2t2ha along with
<>her current. Sarasvati1 did not like the idea. Still,
<>fearing the curse of Vis4va1mitra she agreed to do so. The
<>river-basin where Vasis2t2ha had been performing penance
<>was pulled down by the current of the river, and taking
<>Vasis2t2ha in the current carried him down. Sarasvati1
<>did not wish to leave Vasis2t2ha at the mercy of Vis4va1-
<>mitra. So when they reached the door of the hermitage
<>of Vis4va1mitra, she carried him further down in a swift
<>current. Vis4va1mitra got angry and cursed Sarasvati1.
<>“Let blood flow through the river.” With that the
<>water of Sarasvati1 changed to blood-colour. The gods
<>were perplexed at this. They all gathered on the banks of
<>the river. In the presence of the gods, both the hermits
<>came to a compromise. Thenceforward that place
<>became a holy ti1rtha under the name Vasis2t2ha1pava1ha.

<>under its shade. The silk-cotton tree became arrogant.
<>Once Na1rada came there and praised the tree:--“How
<>gigantic, this silk-cotton tree is! Even in a great storm
<>its branches do not move.” The praise of Na1rada made
<>the tree more haughty. It told Na1rada that the storm
<>etc. were its servants. Na1rada told Va1yu, what the
<>silk-cotton tree said to him. Va1yu got angry and com-
<>ing to the tree, said thus:- “You, wicked silk-cotton
<>tree, in days of yore, when Brahma1 was carrying on
<>creation he took rest on you for a while. That is why I
<>keep motionless when I come to you. It is not because
<>I am afraid of you. I knew that you belittled me before
<>Na1rada. If you are bold enough, come and fight with
<>me.”
<NI>The silk-cotton tree accepted the challenge. Next day
<>Bhagava1n Va1yu changed into a storm and blew against
<>the tree. The tree lost leaves, flowers and fruits and
<>stood bare. Thus within a very short time the arrogance
<>of the tree was curbed.
<NI>This story was told to Yudhis2t2hira by Bhi1s2ma, to show
<>that rendering help to a foe, will only make him
<>haughty. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, 3 Chapters from 154).

<HI>VEDA (S).
<NI>1) {%Introduction.%} The root ‘Vid’ in Sanskrit means ‘to
<>know’. The books composed of the knowledge of the [Page842-a+ 65]
<>A1ryans, collected and compiled were called the Vedas.
<NI>2) {%The origin and importance of the Vedas.%} It is said that
<>Brahma1 was the creator of the Vedas. Many say that,
<>for the performance of sacrifices Brahma1 created from
<>Agni (fire), Va1yu (Wind) and Ravi (the Sun), the
<>three Vedas R2g, Yajus and Sa1man which are eternal and
<>in accordance with regulations.
<NI>The Vedas have two sides, the spiritual and the mun-
<>dane. Moreover all the explanations of the Vedas
<>from the Bra1hman2as to the Bha1s2ya of Sa1yan2a, pertain
<>to sacrifices. The literary meaning of Veda is mundane.
<>Considering these two points and the facts that they are
<>religious books and that they reveal the mental and
<>social outlooks of the early A1ryans, and as the origin of
<>all the thoughts of Indians, all the Vedas, especially
<>R2gveda, hold a lofty place.
<NI>3) {%Parts of the Vedas.%} Maha1vis2n2u incarnated as Vya1sa
<>in Dva1para Yuga and divided the Vedas. The first
<>Veda consisted of four pa1das and a hundred thousand
<>granthas. Vya1sa divided it into four parts known as,
<>R2gveda, Yajurveda, Sa1maveda and Atharvaveda.
<>The sage and seer Vya1sa thus created by R2g, “Hautra”
<>(a collection of lyrics in praise of different Gods, to be
<>recited by the priest styled the ‘hotr2’), by Yajus
<>“A1dhvaryava”, (a book of sacrificial prayer, of prose
<>formulas to be uttered by the ‘Adhvaryu’ priest, who
<>performed the manual work involved in a sacrifice), by
<>Sa1man, “Audga1tra”, (Songs meant to be sung at the
<>Soma sacrifice by a special class of priests ‘Udga1tr2’) and
<>by Atharva “Brahmatva”, (a collection of songs, spells
<>and incantations, for the healing of disease, the restora-
<>tion of harmony, the exorcism of evil spirits and to
<>celebrate the power and omniscience of God) and
<>established them separately. Paila, a scholar in R2g-
<>veda, and a disciple of Vya1sa, gave the original Veda
<>to Indrapramiti and its Sam3hita1 (collections) to Ba1s2kala
<>as gifts. Ba1s2kala divided the Sam3hita1 into four, and
<>gave each of them to Baudhya and others. Yajurveda
<>was divided into twentyfour branches. They were com-
<>posed by Vais4ampa1yana of extraordinary intelligence,
<>a disciple of Vya1sa. Ka1n2d2as (Chapters) such as Va1ja-
<>saneya etc. were composed later by hermits such as
<>Ya1jn5avalkya and others in the form of Smr2tis (tradition,
<>as handing down only the tradition derived from an-
<>cient sages, to whom the Vedas were ‘revealed’).
<>Jaimini the disciple of Vya1sa, divided Sa1maveda into
<>different branches. Sumantu and Sukarma1 compiled
<>separate Sam3hita1s (collections) from them. Sukarma1
<>composed thousand Sam3hita1s. Sumantu the disciple
<>of Vya1sa took the Atharvaveda and taught it to
<>thousands of Paippala1da disciples. By the blessings of
<>Vya1sa, Su1ta made the Pura1n2a Sam3hita1 (the collection
<>of Pura1n2as). (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 150).
<NI>4) {%Branches af the Vedas.%} It has already been mentioned
<>that the Vedas are four in number called R2g, Yajus,
<>Sa1ma and Atharva. Each of these Vedas has branches
<>called Sam3hita1s (collections) and Bra1hman2as (treatises
<>relating to prayer and sacrificial ceremony). A1ran2yakas
<>are appendices to the Bra1hman2as. Upanis2ads (secret
<>or esoteric doctrines) are appendices of the A1ran2yakas.
<>Thus each of the Vedas has Sam3hita1s, Bra1hman2as,
<>A1ran2yakas and Upanis2ads. All these are, in a way, ex-
<>positions of the Vedas. In all these expositions there
<>are numberless Su1ktas. All these taken together are
<>called Vedic literature. [Page842-b+ 65]
<>In the Sam3hita1s there are lyrics in praise of different gods.
<>All these are spells and incantations (mantras) in the
<>form of songs. The under-currents of all these spells are
<>Vedas and stories from the Vedas. Generally speaking
<>the Bra1hman2as contain prose texts giving practical
<>observations on sacrifice which are mentioned in the
<>songs of praise. Here and there stories from Pura1n2as
<>and epics occur. The A1ran2yakas (forest-texts) got that
<>name, because they are books of instruction to be given
<>in the forest or writings meant for wood-dwelling her-
<>mits. As they contained esoteric spells and incanta-
<>tions which might cause injury even to those who were
<>not concerned with them instruction in them was not
<>given in towns or villages. The contents of the A1ran2y-
<>akas are the allegorical signification of the rites and
<>sacrifices and the mystic meaning of the Vedas.
<NI>It has been mentioned that the Upanis2ads are append-
<>ices of the A1ran2yakas. Still there is not much differ-
<>ence between the two and hence they cannot be separat-
<>ed from one another so easily. The Upanis2ads are
<>called Veda1ntas, (The aim and completion of the
<>Vedas), because they are the end of the Vedas. The
<>Veda1ntas belong to the later period of the Vedic age.
<>Instruction in Veda1ntas was given only after completing
<>the study of the mantras (Vedas) and the Bra1hman2as.
<>The Upanis2ads contain philosophical speculations about
<>the conception of Brahman and the Vedas. The word
<>Veda includes the Veda1n3gas also. Veda1n3gas (Ancillaries
<>of the Vedas) are S4iks2a1 (phonetics), Vya1karan2a
<>(grammar), Chandas (metrics), Nirukta (etymology),
<>Joytis2a (astronomy), and Kalpa (ritual). At first
<>instruction is given in the study of Brahman and the
<>study of Vedas. When more discussions and expositions
<>on them are needed, the study of Bra1hman2as and
<>A1ran2yakas are resorted to. In course of time the
<>Bra1hman2as and A1ran2yakas, which contain discussions
<>and expositions of the Vedas became independent
<>branches of study under these names. That is why they
<>contain mainly prose texts.
<NI>There are one lakh of mantras or spells and incanta-
<>tions in all the four Vedas taken together. They are
<>for blessing everybody and to make the four objects of
<>life easily attainable. Sa1n3khya1yana and A1s4vala1yana
<>sorted and grouped the mantras. Accordingly there
<>are two thousand one hundred and ten mantras known
<>as Bra1hman2as. Dvaipa1yana and other hermits have
<>stated the number of granthas (verses) in R2gveda. It
<>is said that there are one thousand nine hundred and
<>ninety nine mantras in Yajurveda. There are one
<>thousand eightysix branches also. The branches in
<>Yajus are known by the names Ka1n2vi1, Ma1dhyandini1,
<>Kat2hi1, Madhyakat2hi1, Maitra1yan2i1, Taittiri1ya, Vais4am-
<>pa1yanika1 and so on.
<NI>In Sa1ma Veda there are branches such as Kauthumi1,
<>A1tharvan2a1yini1 and so on; and songs such as A1ran2yakam,
<>Uktham, U1ham and son on. The number of Sa1mavedic
<>verses are nine thousand four hundred and twenty-
<>five.
<NI>Sumantu, Jan5jali, S4loka1yani, S4aunaka, Pippala1da,
<>Mun5jakes4a and such others were responsible for the
<>sorting and grouping of the mantras in the Atharva-
<>veda. Altogether there are one thousand six hundred
<>Upanis2ads. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 271).
<NI>5) {%Expositions of the Vedas.%} The religion of the A1ryans
<>became an established one when Vya1sa had created the [Page843-a+ 65]
<>Vedasam3hita1s. The aim of Vya1sa was to bring about
<>uniformity in the religious observances by performing
<>rites and rituals, religious ceremonies such as sacrifices
<>etc. without any flaw. Following this a very wide
<>Vedic literature grew up. The study of the Vedas,
<>critical review of meaning, the connection between
<>mantras and tantras (Chants and rituals), Grammar,
<>etymology, all these became inevitable. As the Vedas
<>could be looked at from different points of view, from
<>very early days, various types of expositions of the
<>Vedas came out. Seven types of commentaries,
<>Nairukta, Ya1jn5ika, Vaiya1karan2a Jyautis2a, Sa1mprada1yika
<>A1dhya1tmika, Aitiha1sika (pertaining to etymology,
<>sacrifice, grammar astronomy, customs of a tribe,
<>Bra1hma or Spiritual legends and ancient lore) were
<>the prominent among them. When the westerners
<>began research work in the Vedas, another branch of
<>literature also took form, known as the A1gamikas
<>(the historical). Even in the time of Ya1ska, who
<>was an authority on Nirukta (etymology) the Vedas
<>were expounded on the basis of legends and ancient
<>lore. Hints to this effect are seen in Ya1ska's works.
<>Mention is made about other types of expositions also,
<>in them. The last book of importance in the Sa1mpra-
<>da1yika type of exposition, was Veda1rthapraka1s4a, of
<>Sa1yan2a. But the commentary of Skandasva1mi1, the
<>books R2garthadipika1 and Udgi1thabha1s2ya of Ma1dhava1-
<>ca1rya etc. have spread the sa1mprada1yika type of
<>speculations in India. There is another cult in India
<>which believes that everything seen in the Vedas is
<>spiritual and that the spells and incantations are
<>esoteric.
<NI>6) {%The gods of the Vedas.%} All the gods known today
<>are not found in the Vedas. Even those who are found
<>do not have the prominence that is given to them now.
<>For example, the deity Vis2n2u, worshipped as one of
<>the three godheads today, is not as omnipotent as the
<>Indra of the Vedas. Though Vis2n2u is praised in five
<>spells in R2gveda, when compared with other deities,
<>he was not of much prominence. In the Vedas the
<>incarnation of Va1mana is not given much importance.
<>Even though Rudra is a recognized deity and mention
<>occurs about Kapardi1, in the Vedas, there is not a song
<>of praise of S4iva in the R2gveda. There is no mention
<>at all, about the worship of the Phallus, Devi1 and so
<>on in the Vedas. The Vedas celebrate the Omniscience
<>of Varun2a, Indra, Agni, Mitra, the Maruts and so on.
<>The lustre of Indra was gradually dimmed with the
<>efflux of time and he became a mere libertine in the
<>Pura1n2as. The importance of many deities such as
<>Varun2a, Agni, Mitra, As4vin and so on was greatly dimi-
<>nished in the Pura1n2as. Thirtythree deities pertaining
<>to Earth, Ether and Sky are praised in the Vedas.
<NI>7) {%The rites concerning instruction in Vedas.%} Manu has
<>given certain instructions as to how the teaching of
<>Vedas should be conducted.
<NI>8) {%The teachers of Veda.%} See under Guruparampara1.
<NI>9) {%The period of the Vedas.%} The Indians believe that the
<>spells and incantations and the Bra1hman2as are not man-
<>made, but are revelations by God. So they are con-
<>sidered to be beginningless and endless. The hermits
<>are considered to be seers of the spells. It is mentioned
<>“Mantradras2t2a1rah2 na tu Karta1rah2”. (They are seers
<>of Mantra, not makers). In the opinion of one party,
<>according to this maxim, it is not necessarry to search [Page843-b+ 64]
<>for the creators or the period of creation, of mantras.
<>They hold that only the Su1tras (thread, clue, guide,
<>rule, aphorism) are made by man.
<NI>The westerners and the modern thinkers of India do
<>not agree completely with this view. They believe
<>that the early A1ryans who entered India, first settled
<>down in the Punjab and that the local civilization which
<>they had assumed, broke out as songs of praise. In
<>course of time, these songs of Praise took the form of
<>R2gveda mantras (saying, song, formula). In the begin-
<>ning there was only one Veda. Many believe that this
<>state continued up to B.C. 1500. It is a fact universally
<>acknowledged, that this Vedic literature is the most
<>ancient literature of the world. There is difference of
<>opinion as to the period of origin of this Vedic literature.
<>Prof. Macdonell and Prof. Jacobi are foremost among
<>those who have made their opinions. In the opinion
<>of Prof. Macdonell, the Vedic literature originated in
<>the period between B.C. 1500 and 1200. But Jacobi's
<>opinion is that all the Vedas were made before B.C.
<>4000.
<HI>VEDADIS2A. The son of Br2hadratha, the King of Cedi.

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Ten sons including Kuru, were born to

<>of Kuru gave birth to six sons An3ga and others. An3ga
<>married Suni1tha1. The son Vena was born by Suni1tha1.
<>It is mentioned in Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter

<>to become a great sinner.
<NI>The story says that Suni1tha1 was the mother of Vena. In

<>hurting others. One day when she went to the forest
<>for play with her maids she saw Sus4an3kha the son of
<>a Gandharva named Gi1takola1hala. That youth who
<>was handsome in every part of his body, was doing
<>penance meditating on the goddess Sarasvati1 for the
<>attainment of the art of music. Suni1tha1 began to annoy
<>him daily. Sus4an3kha bore this annoyance patiently.
<>He said only this-“Go away, go away.” But she did
<>not pay heed to his appeals. Once she became angry
<>and struck him. Getting angry at this, Sus4an3kha called
<>out, “You wicked girl! Why do you annoy me? You
<>have beaten me, who am engaged in penance, for no
<>cause.” That righteous Gandharva youth curbed his
<>anger considering that she was a woman.
<NI>She told him “My father will beat everybody in the
<>three worlds. He will harm the wicked, and will not
<>do any harm to the good. So he rules the country
<>righteously.” Suni1tha1 told all about the story to her
<>father. Though Yama, the incarnation of righteousness,
<>heard all that his daughter said he did not give any
<>reply.
<NI>She again went to the forest and struck him with a
<>whip. Sus4an3ka rose up, shivering with pain and cursed
<>her thus:
<NI>“You wicked girl! When you become a house-holder
<>and join your husband you will get a son who will be a
<>scoffer of Devas and Brahmins and an all-round sinner.”
<>Thus cursing her he continued his penance. Vena was
<>born according to this curse.
<NI>3) {%The wicked rule of Vena.%} The hermits anointed Vena
<>as the King. He became lord of the whole earth. He
<>made a proclamation thus:--“Sacrifice is prohibited.
<>Giving alms, is prohibited. Offerings of no kind should
<>be made. Who else, other than I, can be the Yajn5a-
<>purus2a? (the deity who eats the food of sacrifice)? I
<>am the only lord and consumer of sacrifices.”
<NI>Hearing this proclamation, the hermits approached
<>him and told him that the Vedas were the basis of
<>righteousness, that sacrifices were ordained in them, and
<>that if no sacrifice was performed the Devas would not
<>be pleased and so on. But this did not make any change
<>in his behaviour.
<NI>The hermits became angry. They all gathered together
<>and recited spells and struck him with Darbha (poa)
<>grass and killed him. As there was no King the world
<>fell into darkness. Because of the troubles caused by
<>plunderers, people gathered round the hermits. Hermits
<>joined together and churned the left hand of Vena,
<>from which a man of short stature came out, to whom
<>the hermits said, ‘Nis2i1da’ (sit). Because the hermits
<>said Nis2i1da’, Nis2a1da came into existence from that
<>dwarf born of the sins of Vena. Then the hermits
<>churned the right hand of Vena. At this churning a
<>person as big as a mountain with divine signs came out.
<>He had bow and arrows and in his palm there were
<>marks of a wheel and flag. Seeing this the Devas [Page845-a+ 65]
<>anointed him the King of the earth. He ruled righte-
<>ously and brought the goddess earth (Pr2thvi1) who had
<>estranged herself from his father Vena close to him.
<>Because he had conciliated Pr2thvi1 he became famous
<>as a King. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 47).

<>is not meet and right on the part of a heroic mother to
<>welcome a son who comes home being defeated in
<>battle. To substantiate this point, she told S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>the story of Vidula1, as given below.
<NI>Vidula1 was a brave woman, who lived in ancient India.
<>Her son San5jaya fought with the King of Sindhu and
<>was defeated. When he came home Vidula1 did not
<>receive him. She emboldened him by saying that she
<>would be more proud of a son, who had sacrificed his
<>life, in the battlefield than one who returned home
<>defeated. All his arguments which were excuses for his
<>cowardice, were refuted by his mother. At last San5jaya
<>engaged again in a battle with the King of Sindhu.
<NI>On hearing this story told by Kunti1 S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a became
<>immensely pleased. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, 3 Chapters
<>from 134).
<HI>VIDURA I.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Vidura was a superhuman
<>being, very famous in the story of Maha1bha1rata, as a
<>brother of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, as a man of colossal intelligence
<>who had been closely watching the goings and comings
<>of the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas, as the adviser of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, and as a man of immense learning and
<>wisdom.
<NI>2) {%Incarnation af Dharmadeva.%} There is a story in Maha1-
<>Bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 107, which describes
<>Vidura as born from a portion of Dharmadeva. The
<>story is given below.
<NI>Long ago there was a hermit called Ma1n2d2avya in India.
<>As he was standing in deep meditation near his hermit-
<>age, the men of the King chased some thieves and came
<>to the place where the hermit stood. The robbers
<>placed the stolen property near the hermit and ran
<>away. The king's men caught the hermit, and the
<>thieves. The King ordered them to be placed on a
<>trident. The thieves died on the trident. But Ma1n2d2avya
<>was not dead. The King sawed the trident and got
<>Ma1n2d2avya down. The hermit went to Dharmadeva and
<>asked him what his blame was for suffering the punish-
<>ment of the trident on him. Dharmadeva replied that
<>the punishment was inflicted for a cruel deed he had
<>done in his childhood. He had caught some flies and
<>made a bunch of them by piercing them with the rib of
<>a coconut-palm leaf. But Ma1n2d2avya argued that
<>Dharmadeva was not right in punishing him because
<>the S4a1stras and rules of righteousness said that mistakes
<>committed by boys below the age of twelve could not
<>be considered to be sins. Further he cursed Dharmadeva
<>that he would take birth on the earth from the womb
<>of a S4u1dra1. Accordingly Dharmadeva took birth from
<>the womb of the servant of Ambika1 and Amba1lika1.
<NI>3) {%Birth.%} Vidura was born as the brother of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u. (For detailed story see under Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra I, para 2).
<NI>4) {%Up to marriage.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura
<>spent their younger days in Hastina1pura as inseparable
<>brothers. Their teacher was Bhi1s2ma. Vidura learned
<>the Vedas, S4a1stras, Pura1n2as, Itiha1sas etc. also, along
<>with the education given to a prince such as archery,
<>club-fight, sword-fight, wrestling, controlling elephants
<>etc. He understood that to be righteous was far better [Page848-b+ 64]
<>than fighting. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 108, that Vidura got the sense of righteousness,
<>and education in fighting, at the same time.
<NI>Childhood ended. As Vidura was born to a Brahmin
<>by a S4u1dra1 woman he had no right to become King.
<>When he grew up, the duty to find a wife for him fell
<>on Bhi1s2ma. At that time a damsel born to a Brahmin
<>by a S4u1dra1 woman was being brought up in the palace
<>of King Devaka. With the permission of Devaka, Bhi1s2ma
<>brought the girl and gave her in marriage to Vidura.
<>It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 114,
<>that sons and daughters were born to the couple.
<NI>5) {%Partiality towards the Pa1n2d2avas.%} Vidura was the most
<>intelligent and wisest man of his time, and he always
<>favoured righteousness. Though he viewed the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas with equal favour, in his heart he
<>felt some partiality towards the Pa1n2d2avas, because they
<>were virtuous, whereas the Kauravas were becoming
<>more and more wicked. As this partiality arose from
<>his sense of righteousness, nobody could blame Vidura
<>for this. His aim was the prosperity of the Lunar
<>dynasty of Kings.
<NI>Many ill omens were seen at the time of the birth
<>of Duryodhana. Vidura understood that if that infant
<>grew up he would be a comet to the Lunar dynasty. It
<>is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 115,
<>that Vidura advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that it would be better
<>for him to throw away that infant.
<NI>The death of Pa1n2d2u drew Vidura closer to the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>Vidura took the lead in performing the funeral rites
<>and other ceremonies which followed. The Pa1n2d2avas.
<>were very sad and miserable at the death of their father.
<>It was at this time that Duryodhana poisoned Bhi1ma-
<>sena, tied him with a rope and threw him into the
<>river Ganges. Bhi1masena was carried to the world of
<>na1gas (serpents). Kunti1 felt grieved at the loss of her
<>son Bhi1ma, but Vidura consoled her.
<NI>It was due to the wisdom of Vidura that the Pa1n2d2avas
<>escaped from the disaster in the lac-house. As soon as
<>Duryodhana had completed the lac-house, Vidura
<>understood the deception lying hidden under it.
<>and he informed the Pa1n2d2avas of everything about it.
<>Moreover he sent a man named Khanaka and made
<>an underground passage from the lac-house. When the
<>lac-house was burnt down, the Pa1n2d2avas escaped by
<>the under-ground passage and reached the banks of
<>the Ganges. Vidura had sent a ferryman secretly to
<>take them to the other side of the Ganges. When
<>Bhi1s2ma got the news that the Pa1n2d2avas had been burnt
<>to death in the lac-house he became very sad. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>149, that Vidura informed Bhi1s2ma secretly that the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were not dead.
<NI>After this event the Pa1n2d2avas come into the scene only
<>at the Svayam3vara (marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li1. Bhi1s2ma and
<>Dron2a proposed that the Pa1n2d2avas should be brought
<>back and be given half of the kingdom. Vidura, by his
<>arugments convinced Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that the proposal of
<>Bhi1s2ma and Dron2a was correct. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked
<>Vidura to bring the Pa1n2d2avas back. Vidura went to
<>the city of Drupada and brought the Pa1n2d2avas back
<>and consoled their mother Kunti1. After this Yudhis2t2hira
<>performed Ra1jasu1ya (sacrifice of royal consecration).
<>Vidura took part in it and took the charge of financial [Page849-a+ 65]
<>part of the sacrifice. It was after this that Duryodhana
<>challenged Yudhis2t2hira for a game of dice. Vidura saw
<>beforehand that this move on the part of Duryodhana
<>was dangerous. So he talked forcibly against this, and
<>gave warning to all concerned. As Duryodhana did not
<>agree with Vidura, he was scolded. But Duryodhana
<>was firm and the game was conducted. Pa1n5ca1li1 was
<>harassed by means of stripping and the Pa1n2d2avas went
<>to the forest. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 3, that Vidura had been witnessing all these
<>scenes with wet eyes.
<NI>6) {%Separated from the Pa1n2d2avas.%} When the Pa1n2d2avas
<>were driven to the forest, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra felt sorry. He
<>became more afraid of the people than he was sorry
<>for the Pa1n2d2avas. He understood that his subjects
<>would unite and rise against his sons. He called
<>Vidura and asked him for a remedy. Vidura who was
<>full of impatience, made a speech against the wicked-
<>ness of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and advised him to
<>forsake his own sons and to bring the Pa1n2d2avas back
<>and give them the kingdom. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra did not like
<>this approach. He said that Vidura was partial to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and asked him to go away from the palace.
<>Vidura became grieved at this. He followed the
<>Pa1n2d2avas, and walking a long distance, reached the
<>forest Ka1myaka and met the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>When Vidura had gone Dhr2tara1s2t2ra felt miserable.
<>He sent for Vidura and when he returned Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>begged for pardon. Vidura again became the adviser
<>of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 6).
<NI>7) {%Adviser of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.%} The advice of Vidura is
<>famous in Maha1bha1rata. The main duty of Vidura was
<>to console Dhr2tara1s2t2ra by speaking about righteousness
<>when he became troubled in mind because of the const-
<>ant quarrels between his sons and the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>Vidura fulfilled his duty well. Duryodhana was firm on
<>the point that not a dot of land would be given to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to Hastina1pura as mediator.
<>Duryodhana showed disrespect to him. Vidura said
<>in strong words that it was wrong on the part of
<>Duryodhana to have done so and compelled Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra to show due respect and hospitality to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>Accordingly Dhr2tara1s2t2ra welcomed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and
<>showed respect and hospitality. Knowing this, Duryo-
<>dhana and his brothers tried to make S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a a
<>captive. Vidura harshly scolded them for this attempt.
<>Seeing all these impudent actions on the part of his
<>sons, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra became distressed. Vidura consoled
<>him by good exhortations. He told Dhr2tara1s2t2ra about
<>the transience of life and the importance of the soul.
<>When the battle was fiercely going on in the battle-
<>ground of Kuruks2etra, Vidura re ained with Dhrta-
<>ra1s2t2ra consoling him and giving him good advice. The
<>death of Bhi1s2ma was an unbearable grief to Vidura. He
<>took part in the funeral of Bhi1s2ma. He himself placed
<>the body on the funeral pyre. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 168, Stanza 11).
<NI>8) {%Pilgrimage.%} When Vidura failed in his attempt to
<>ward off a pitched battle between the Kauravas and
<>the Pa1n2d2avas he felt extremely miserable. Without
<>taking part in the battle, he started on a pilgrimage.
<>Getting the news at Prabha1saksetra about the end of
<>the battle, he went to the basin of river Yamuna1. On
<>the way he heard the news of the passing away of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a, from Uddhava. Before death S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a had [Page849-b+ 64]
<>revealed that Vidura had heard Uddhavagi1ta1 from
<>Maitreya. This book which is in the form of a conver-
<>sation between Vidura and Maitreya contains the talk
<>between Kapila and Devahu1ti. Description of the line
<>of Manus, sacrifice of Daks2a, story of Dhruva, story
<>of Pr2thu, story of Puran5jana etc. were the subjects of the
<>talk. (Bha1gavata, 3--4).
<NI>9) {%End.%} The Bha1rata-battle came to an end. The
<>Kauravas were exterminated. Efforts were begun to
<>establish law and order. In all these efforts Vidura was
<>a help to the Pa1n2d2avas. Still he spent most of his time
<>with the old Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Yudhis2t2hira came to Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and both embraced each other. Seeing this
<>Vidura cried aloud. Vidura advised Yudhis2t2hira how
<>to carry on the administration of the new government.
<>After this he decided to go to the forest to spend his
<>last days. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1, Kunti1, Vidura and
<>S4akuni went to the forest. The Pa1n2d2avas tried in vain
<>to prevent them from going. When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1, Kunti1, Vidura, San5jaya and others started
<>for the forest, even Bhi1masena cried aloud. Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the people of the city went along with them up to
<>the river Ganges. On the bank of the Ganges near the
<>hermitage of S4atayu1pa, a hermitage was erected and
<>Vidura and the others lived there.
<NI>They lived there for nearly six years. The Pa1n2d2avas be-
<>came unable to bear the separation from their elders.
<>Once Dharmaputra dreamt about his mother. Next day
<>the Pa1n2d2avas went to the banks of the Ganges. Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>Subhadra1, Uttara1 and many people of the city followed
<>them. They went to the S4atayu1pa-hermitage and saw
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the others. But the great Vidura was
<>not there. When asked about it he got the reply that
<>having become abstemious and having no more desires
<>he was wandering about. Yudhis2t2hira was greatly
<>troubled.
<NI>Next day at dawn when Yudhis2t2hira went to bathe in
<>the Ganges, on the way he saw Vidura sitting in contem-
<>plation with a stone in his mouth. Yudhis2t2hira stood
<>with joined palms before the lean and weak form of
<>that sage and said “Look, Dharmaputra bows before
<>you.” He repeated this several times. But there was
<>no change in Vidura. Yudhis2t2hira's disappointment
<>did not last long. For, in a short while Dharmaputra
<>saw that a divine radiance emanated from the body
<>of Vidura and passed on to his body and that the body
<>of Vidura fell lifeless on the ground. This union took
<>place because both Vidura and Yudhis2t2hira were port-
<>ions of Dharmadeva. After this Dharmaputra made
<>preparations to burn the body of Vidura. Then an ethe-
<>real voice said “Vidura is abstemious. His body should
<>not be burned.” Dharmaputra went to the hermitage
<>and informed all, about the death of Vidura. (M.B.
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapters 26 to 28).
<NI>Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Svarga1rohan2a Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanza 22, that Vidura entered Svarga
<>(heaven) and stays there in the form of Dharmadeva.
<HI>VIDURA II. A Ks2atriya who lived in Pa1n5ca1la. The
<>story of this Vidura, who had killed a Brahmin because
<>of his want, is given in Padma Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhand2a,
<>Chapter 91. The story is given below:
<NI>Long ago there lived a Ks2atriya, named Vidura, in
<>Pa1n5ca1la. Because of penury he killed a Brahmin. After
<>that the Ks2atriya discarded his lock of hair and Brahma- [Page850-a+ 64]
<>string and went to every house saying “Look, here am
<>I, a slayer of Brahmin. Please, give alms to the drunk-
<>ard and killer of a Brahmin.” Saying thus he walked
<>from house to house and took alms. But he did not get
<>remission of Brahmahatya1 (killing of a Brahmin).
<NI>Filled with grief and sorrow and mental worry the
<>sinner Vidura sat in the shade of a tree. At that time
<>Candras4arma1, a Brahmin of Magadha came there. He
<>was a wicked man who had killed his teacher because
<>of inordinate lust in consequence of which he had been
<>forsaken by his own people. Vidura asked Candras4arma1
<>who wore no sign of a Bra1hman2a, what he was. Candra-
<>s4arma1 told his story to Vidura who in return told him
<>his sinful acts.
<NI>At this time another Brahmin named Vedas4arma1 came
<>there. He also was a sinner. The three of them told each
<>other about their sinful acts. At this time Valla1la, a
<>Vais4ya came there. He was a drunkard who had killed
<>cows. These four desperate sinners travelled together
<>and visited several ti1rthas (holy baths). But they did not
<>get remission of their sins. At last they started for
<>Ka1lan5jaragiri.
<NI>While these desperate sinners were living in Ka1lan5jara
<>a poor Brahmin came there. He asked them why they
<>were so sad. They told him everything. When he heard
<>their stories he felt pity for them. The old Brahmin said
<>“You sinners should go to Praya1ga, Pus2kara, Sarvati1rtha
<>and Va1ra1n2asi1 and bathe in the Gan3ga1 on New Moon days
<>and you will become free from sin.” They obeyed the
<>old Brahmin and went to the holy places told by him.
<>Thus Vidura and his friends became sinless.
<HI>VIDU1RA. A king of the Kuru dynasty. He was the son
<>born to the great king Kuru by S4ubha1n3gi1, a damsel of
<>Da1s4a1rha family. Vidu1ra married Sampriya1, a princess
<>of Madhu royal family. A son named Anas4va1 was born

<>Jara1sandha and so on. Jara1sandha employed this
<>Vidu1ratha as the guardian of the Eastern entrance
<>of the city of Mathura1. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed his
<>brother Dantavaktra, S4a1lva, S4is4upa1la and others, Vidu1-
<>ratha ran to take revenge on Kr2s2n2a. But he was killed
<>by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>(v) It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Svarga1rohan2a
<>Parva, Chapter 5, Stanza 16, that after death he joined

<>this child.
<HI>VIDU1RATHA III. A king who was the friend of the her-
<>mit Bhalanda. This king had two sons named Suni1ti and
<>Sumati and a daughter named Muda1vati1. One day while
<>Vidu1ratha was hunting in the forest, he saw a cleavage
<>on the earth caused by the yawning of Kujr2mbha1sura.
<>The king stood there for a while looking at the cleavage.
<>Then the hermit Suvrata who had been standing close
<>by approached the king and said. “This asura Kujr2mbha
<>has a divine pestle with him. Because of the possession
<>of this pestle he has become invincible and is a threat
<>to the whole world.”
<NI>Vidu1ratha, who knew everything from Suvrata, lived
<>cautiously. One day his daughter was carried away by
<>this Kujr2mbha1sura. Suni1ti and Sumati confronted the
<>asura to rescue their sister but were made captives.
<>Finally Vatsapri, the son of the hermit Bhalanda killed

<HI>VIGRAHA III. (Image).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God, who is not discernible to
<>the outward senses, is given embodiment and consecrat-
<>ed in places of worship by people. These figures are
<>called Vigrahas (idols or images). People worship
<>S4a1lagra1ma, (a kind of ammonite found in the river
<>Gan2d2aki1), Ba1n2alin3ga (Phallus), mystical diagrams,
<>animals, birds, trees, rivers, lakes, places of death etc.
<>and so many other things.
<NI>2) {%The different kinds of Vigrahas.%} Vigrahas are of three
<>groups. They are:-(1) Mysterious (2) Evident-mysteri-
<>ous (3) Evident. S4a1lagra1ma, Phallus etc. belong to the
<>group mysterious. The Mukhalin3ga, considered to be
<>the image of Trimu1rti (Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva) in the
<>Elephanta cave, belongs to the group Evident. The
<>image of Phallus is Evident-mysterious. In the first,
<>there is no form or figure. In the second there are parts
<>of the figure. The image which shows the entire figure
<>is Evident.
<NI>Some gods and goddesses possess two appearances,
<>peaceful and fierce. Those who wish to succeed in
<>performing cruel deeds and to vanquish enemies, wor-
<>ship fierce gods whereas those who wish for peace,
<>worship peaceful Gods. Vis4varu1pa, (assuming all
<>shapes), Narasim3ha (the man-lion), Vat2apatras4a1yi1 (as
<>lying on banyan-leaf) and Paras4ura1ma are fierce forms
<>of Vis2n2u. Destroying Ka1ma (cupid) Gaja and Tripura
<>are fierce forms of S4iva worshipped by some people.
<>Generally temples with images in this form are erected
<>outside the village or city.
<NI>Owing to the differences, in the making and the mater-
<>ials used, the images are divided into three groups. [Page852-a+ 64]
<>They are portraits, Half-portraits and corrupted
<>portraits. The whole of the figure will be made in
<>(portraits) citras. In half-citras only the front view
<>will be completed. Corrupted Citras are images done
<>on the wall or rock.
<NI>3) {%Main images.%} Main images are mostly S4aivite or
<>Vais2n2avite. There will be one or two other images.
<>Worship of Devi1 (Goddess) is one of them. The S4aivi-
<>tes will worship Pa1rvati1 also after S4iva and the Vais2n2a-
<>vites Maha1laks2mi1 also after Vis2n2u In South India the
<>worshippers are S4aivites and Vais2n2avites.
<NI>4) {%S4aivites.%} In India a large number of people worship
<>S4iva. There is not much difference in the mode of wor-
<>ship of these various people. There are worships which
<>are in accordance with the Vedas and which are not.
<>Forms of worship which are Sa1ttvika (of goodness) and
<>which are not, could be seen. The S4aiva worship called
<>Paras4upada is very ancient. The phallus at Gud2imalla
<>is considered to be as old as B.C. 2nd century. From
<>this it could be inferred how old, the S4aivite worship is
<>in India.
<NI>5) {%The S4aivite images.%} Of the emblems denoting S4iva,
<>the most important is the Phallus, which is of two kinds,
<>movable and immovable. Risen by itself and or erected
<>and set firm and consecrated inside temples are immov-
<>able; that which is made of earth, metal, jewel, wood
<>or stone, is movable. There are Phalluses made for the
<>time being. They are fixed on platforms or pedestals.
<>They are of different sizes and shapes. The Phallus is
<>made of male stone and the pedestal of female stone.
<NI>6) {%The portions of S4iva.%} There are various kinds of images
<>meant to reveal various attributes of S4iva. Lin3godbhava
<>(originated from Phallus), Candras4ekhara, Raudra,
<>Uma1sam3hita (with Uma1) etc. are some of them. Ka1ma1-
<>ntaka (killing Ka1ma or Cupid), Gaja1ri (enemy of Gaja),
<>Ka1la1ri (Enemy of Yama) and Tripurada1haka (burn-
<>ing Tripura) are figures of extermination. S4iva has
<>the figures of blessing Can2d2es4a, Vis2n2u, Nandi1s4vara,
<>Vighnes4a and Arjuna also. There are a large number
<>of images in various dancing poses.
<NI>There are four other figures of Daks2in2a1mu1rti, such as the
<>explanation, knowledge, yoga (or meditation, contem-
<>plation and other ways of union with the Universal
<>Soul) and Vi1n2a1dhara (carrying a lute). A few other
<>forms are Bhiks2a1t2aka (begging alms), Kapa1ladha1ri1
<>(wearing skulls), Gan3ga1dhara (bearing the Gan3ges),
<>Ardhana1ri1s4vara (God half of whom is a woman),
<>Vr2s2abhava1hana (seated on a bull), Vis2abhaks2aka (eat-
<>ing poison) etc. The figures of Sada1s4iva, Mahes4a,
<>Eka1das4arudras (eleven Rudras), Vidyes4vara and Mu1rt-
<>yas2t2aka are seen occasionally here and there. There
<>are scriptures describing these figures.
<NI>7) {%The Devas (gods) connected with S4iva.%} Among the gods
<>connected with S4iva, first place is given to Gan2apati.
<>Worship of Gan2apati was in vogue from 6th or 7th
<>century B.C. Perhaps the images that we see today
<>were made after this period.
<NI>In South India temples dedicated to Gan2apati are not
<>scarce. The position of Gan2apati is at the entrance of
<>villages and fortresses, at the foot of banyan trees, at
<>the entrance of temples and at the south-west corner of
<>S4aivite temples.
<NI>There are images of Gan2apati in the postures of stand-
<>ing and dancing. Main images are those with the trunk [Page852-b+ 65]
<>turned to the right and to the left. The trunk is turned
<>to the right in some and to the left in others.
<NI>8) {%Subrahman2ya.%} Subrahman2ya is worshipped only in
<>South India. Subrahman2ya is known by various names
<>such as Kuma1ra, Muruka, Ka1rttikeya, Skanda, A1rumu-
<>kha, Guha, and so on. Temples dedicated to Subrah-
<>man2ya are seen in plenty in Tamil Nadu. They are all
<>situated on the tops of hills.
<NI>There is sufficient proof in the poetic works of the
<>San3gha period, to the fact that Subrahman2ya-worship
<>was prevalent in South India. On excavation at the
<>place Na1ga1rjunakon2d2a in the District of Guntur, images
<>of Subrahman2ya were found under the earth. They
<>were as old as 3rd century B.C.
<NI>Images of Subrahman2ya are seen in various postures
<>and shapes such as sitting, with six faces, with one face,
<>with two hands, with four hands, sometimes with wife,
<>in the state of having finished investiture with the
<>Brahma-string etc. There are figures sitting on the pea-
<>cock also.
<NI>9) {%Other images.%} Images of S4akti, Laks2mi1, Earth-goddess,
<>Sarasvati1, Saptama1tr2s (Seven Mothers), Jyes2t2ha1, Vis2n2u,
<>the ten incarnations, the planets such as the sun etc.
<>the deities of the weapon like the thunderbolt, S4akti
<>(lance), Nandikes4vara, Can2d2es4vara, S4a1sta1, Ks2etrapa1la,
<>Brahma1, Guardians of the zones, As4vini1devas, half gods,
<>etc. are also dedicated and worshipped in temples.
<HI>VIHAN3GA. A serpent (na1ga) born in the race of the
<>Na1ga Aira1vata. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 57, Stanza 12, that this serpent fell in
<>the sacrificial fire of the serpent-sacrifice performed by
<>Janamejaya and was burnt to death.
<HI>VIHAN3GAMA. A soldier of the giant Khara. This Khara
<>who confronted Ra1ma and Laks2man2a in Dan2d2aka1ran2ya
<>(forest Dan2d2aka) had twelve army captains under him,
<>including Vihan3gama, (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 26).
<HI>VIHAVYA. The son of Varcas who was born in the
<>dynasty of Gr2tsamada. Vitatya was the son of this
<>Vihavya. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 30, Stanza
<>61).
<HI>VIHUN2D2A. An asura. This asura was the son of the mighty
<>and great Asura Hun2d2a. At the time of the fierce battle
<>between the devas and the asuras, this mighty asura
<>Hun2d2a and Nahus2a confronted each other and Hun2d2a
<>was killed. After this Vihun2d2a, the son of Hun2d2a fought
<>with Nahus2a. In the earlier part of the battle Vihun2d2a
<>and his army suffered defeat. Vihun2d2a began to do
<>penance in order to defeat the Devas who got terrified
<>at this and went to Maha1vis2n2u and prayed for protect-
<>ion. Vis2n2u consoled them saying that he would take
<>necessary steps. When the Devas were gone, Vis2n2u took
<>the form of a beautiful woman and went in search of
<>Vihun2d2a. They met each other in the garden Nandana.
<>Vihun2d2a fell in love with her. He wanted to marry her.
<>She said, “Oh, Handsome Vihun2d2a, I have no objection
<>to be your wife. But there is a condition, you, must
<>gather seven crores of Ka1moda flowers and offer them
<>as oblation to S4iva, and then make a garland of
<>Ka1moda flowers and put it on my neck. From that
<>day onwards I am yours.”
<NI>Vihun2d2a agreed to it. He went for the flowers. He
<>wandered over forests and mountains. Nobody had any
<>idea of such a tree or flower. Thinking that this condi-
<>tion, laid by the damsel, was a deceit played upon him, [Page853-a+ 65]
<>he stood perplexed when the hermit S4ukra saw him.
<>He told the hermit everything. Then S4ukra told him,
<>“Ka1moda is neither a tree nor a flower. She is goddess
<>who came up from the sea of Milk at the time of the
<>churning. She dwells at Gan3ga1dva1ra. When she laughs
<>pure white fragrant flowers fall from her lips, on the
<>water of Gan3ga1, every moment. When she is sad, the
<>flowers that fall from her lips will be red.”
<NI>Vihun2d2a started for Gan3ga1dva1ra. Na1rada knew this.
<>He came to Vihun2d2a and said, “It is difficult to reach
<>Gan3ga1dva1ra and please Ka1moda1, and obtain the flower.
<>So the easiest way is to gather the flowers that come
<>down through the water of Gan3ga1.” Vihun2d2a agreed.
<>He took his seat on the bank of Gan3ga1 and waited for
<>the flowers to come.
<NI>Na1rada decided to cause harm to Vihun2d2a. So he went
<>to Ka1moda1 and by way of telling her news, he inform-
<>ed her that the hermit Bhr2gu had cursed Maha1vis2n2u
<>and changed him into a man. On hearing this Ka1moda1
<>began to cry. Red flowers fell from her lips. They were
<>carried down in cluster by the water of Gan3ga1. Vihun2d2a
<>gathered them and went to the dwelling place of S4iva.
<>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 saw this by their inward eyes. Pa1rvati1
<>did not like the idea of offering red flowers at the feet
<>of her beloved husband. S4iva found out a remedy for
<>it. He advised Pa1rvati1 to offer pure white flowers at his
<>feet standing as a boy. Vihun2d2a came with red flowers
<>Pa1rvati1 appeared in the form of a boy. Both began to
<>vie with each other in offering flowers at the feet of
<>S4iva. Gradually it changed to a fight between the boy
<>and Vihun2d2a. In the fight Vihun2d2a was killed. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mi khan2d2a, some chapters from 119).

<HI>VIJAYA XII. A bow of Indra. This is as bright as
<>Ga1n2d2i1va and as strong as the bow S4a1rn3gadhanus of
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. The bows of the Devas, considered to be
<>most divine, are Vijaya, Ga1n2d2i1va and S4a1rn3ga. Vijaya
<>belongs to Indra, Ga1n2d2i1va to Varun2a and S4a1rn3ga to
<>Vis2n2u. Once Druma, a Kimpurus2a (demi god) who lived
<>in the mountain Gandhama1dana got Vijaya from Indra.
<>After that Rukmi1, his disciple got this bow from Druma.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 158, Stanza 3).
<HI>VIJAYA XIII. The divine bow of Karn2a. It is said that
<>this bow was the most divine of all weapons. This bow
<>which was made by Vis4vakarma1, originally belonged
<>to Indra. At that time Indra had defeated many asuras

<>loved disciple Paras4ura1ma. Karn2a got it from Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. It is said that this bow was superior to Ga1n2d2i1va.
<>It was with the help of this bow that Paras4ura1ma con-
<>quered the Ks2atriyas twentyone times. (M.B. Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 42).

<>born to Sahadeva by Vijaya1.
<HI>VIJAYA1 III. A synonym of Devi1 Durga1. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 6, Stanza 16).
<HI>VIJAYADAS4AMI1. A festival of Indians. As this festival
<>is celebrated for nine nights from the 1st to the 9th in the
<>bright lunar fortnight of the month of Kanni (Sep-
<>tember-October) it is known as Navara1tri (Nine nights)
<>and as it continues up to Das4ami1 (the tenth night) it
<>is called Dasra. The Hindus believe that the Vijaya-
<>das4ami1 (the victorious tenth) was the day on which
<>Devi1 Durga1 killed Mahis2a1sura and got victory. So this
<>day is considered to be a suitable moment to begin the
<>learning of all the arts which would enable one to carry
<>on a successful life. Sarasvati1 is considered the trans-
<>figuration of Durga1. As people became less superstiti-
<>ous, they began to consider the story of killing Mahis2a1-
<>sura as a metaphorical saying, to mean the killing of
<>ignorance. So the day of victory of Devi1 Durga1 (the same
<>as Sarasvati1) is considered to be the auspicious moment
<>for the beginning of learning. The warrior places his
<>weapons, the man of literature his books and pen, the
<>musician his musical instruments, at the feet of Devi1 and
<>with devotion and worship receives them back from
<>Devi1 on the Vijayadas4ami1 day at an auspicious
<>moment.
<NI>This is a festival celebrated everywhere in India. In
<>several native states this festival used to be celebrated
<>under the sponsorship of the royal family as a State
<>festival. As it is believed that Mahis2a1sura had lived in
<>Mysore the celebration of Dasra in that State generally
<>is on a grand scale. In Kerala, from olden times this
<>festival was celebrated under the patronage of the Van5ci
<>Royal family.
<HI>VIJAYALAKS2MI1. One of the eight Laks2mi1s. The duty
<>of Vijayalaks2mi1 was keeping the treasury of Brahma1.
<>Once she showed carelessness in her duty. So Brahma1 [Page854-a+ 64]
<>cursed her to go and guard the gate tower of Ra1van2a.
<>Accordingly Vijayalaks2mi1 guarded the gate of Lan3ka1
<>under the name Lan3ka1laks2mi1. When she was hit by
<>Hanu1ma1n she obtained her original form and returned
<>to the world of Devas. (See under Lan3ka1laks2mi1).
<HI>VIJITA1S4VA. One of the five sons of emperor Pr2thu.
<>Vijita1s4va decided to perform one hundred horse-
<>sacrifices and completed ninetynine. Seeing this Indra
<>feared that he might be deposed. So he stealthily took
<>away the sacrificial horse of Vijita1s4va.
<NI>There was a fierce battle between Indra and Vijita1s4va
<>in which Indra was defeated, and Vijita1s4va recovered
<>the stolen horse from Indra. It was from that day on-

<HI>VIKRAMA1DITYA. Vikrama1ditya, who is believed to be
<>one of the mighty emperors of Bha1rata, was an extra-
<>ordinarily wise, righteous and valiant ruler. There are
<>several stories in all the languages of India, prevalent every-
<>where. They are generally called Vikrama1ditya stories.
<>Vikrama1ditya was the son of Mahendra1ditya, King of
<>Ujjayini1. Mahendra1ditya and his wife Saumyadars4ana1
<>were in great distress as they were childless. Sumati,
<>the Prime Minister, Vajra1yudha, the army commander,
<>and Mahi1dhara, the priest, were as distressed as the
<>royal couple. The King and the queen engaged them-
<>selves in fast and prayer.
<NI>In the meanwhile, the Devas found life extremely
<>difficult due to the wicked deeds of the barbarians, and
<>they went to Kaila1sa and told Rudradeva of their
<>grievances. They said, “Oh! Lord! All the asuras
<>exterminated by yourself and Maha1vis2n2u, are born
<>on the earth as Barbarians. They commit great sins
<>such as killing the Brahmins, obstructing sacrifices
<>carrying away hermit damsels etc. The sacrificial
<>offerings in the sacred fire with Vedic Mantras by
<>Brahmins, is the food of Devas. Because of the troubles
<>caused by the Barbarians in the earth, the sacrifices are
<>hindered and the Devas are in trouble due to lack of
<>food. So a being, mighty and strong enough to ex-
<>terminate all the Barbarians on the earth, should take
<>incarnation.”
<NI>S4iva agreed and sent the devas back to their world.
<>Then he called Ma1lyava1n and told him to take birth
<>as the son of Mahendra1ditya in the city of Ujjayini1. [Page855-a+ 64]
<>S4iva added. “You should exterminate all the Barbarians
<>and reinstate rituals and ceremonies. The Yaks2as,
<>Ra1ks2asas, ghosts etc. will be under your control. You
<>will be an emperor there with divine powers.” Accord-
<>ingly Ma1lyava1n took birth as the son of Mahendra1-
<>ditya. That infant was Vikrama1ditya who became a
<>mighty emperor later. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Vis2amas4i1la-
<>lambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>VIKRAMAS4I1LA. A King praised in the Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>Pura1n2a. Ka1lindi1 was his wife and Durgama his son.
<HI>VIKRA1NTA. A King who was the father of Sudhr2ti
<>and the son of King Dama. It is mentioned in Va1yu
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 86, that Vikra1nta was an ideal King
<>who loved and cared for his subjects.
<HI>VIKR2TA. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 196, that this was the name adopted
<>by Ka1madeva (Cupid) when he argued with Iks2va1ku,
<>in the form of a Brahmin.
<HI>VIKR2TI. A King of the family of Yaya1ti. This King's

<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 9).
<HI>VIKS2ARA. A noble asura born to Kas4yapa Praja1pati
<>by his wife Danu. The most powerful of the Da1navas
<>(asuras) given birth to by Danu1, were Viks2ara, Bala,
<>Vi1ra and Vr2tra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza
<>33). Of these Viks2ara took rebirth later as King
<>Vasumitra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 41).
<HI>VIKUKS2I. A son of Iks2va1ku. It is said that Iks2va1ku
<>was born from the spittle of Manu. It is stated in Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7, that after the death of S4arya1ti,
<>the Ra1ks2asas (giants) attacked Ayodhya1 and the sons
<>of the King having fled to different directions, Iks2va1ku
<>continued the dynasty of S4arya1ti in Ayodhya1. Hundred
<>sons beginning with Vikuks2i, were born to Iks2va1ku.
<>Of these hundred sons fifty were employed to rule
<>over the regions of East and North and fortyeight, to
<>rule over the regions in the south and the west. With
<>the remaining two sons the King stayed in Ayodhya1,
<>and carried on administration.
<NI>One day King Iks2va1ku resolved to conduct the great
<>sacrifice of offering to the manes called Maha1pralaya-
<>s4ra1ddha, for which preparations were speedily made.
<>The hermits such as Vasis2t2ha and others arrived
<>according to invitation. He sent his son Vikuks2i to the
<>forest to bring the required amount of flesh for the
<>sacrifice. Vikuks2i entered the forest and hunted hare,
<>hog, deer etc. and collected the required quantity of
<>flesh; but on the way home, he became tired of hunger.
<>To appease his hunger he took a small hare from the
<>collection cooked it and ate it. He took the balance to
<>the King who was much pleased with his son and gave
<>the animals to Vasis2t2ha the family priest for proks2an2a
<>(sprinkling of holy water on the animals before sacri-
<>fice). But Vasis2t2ha got angry and said, “flesh which
<>constitutes remains is not acceptable.” The king
<>understood the truth only then. He was filled with
<>anger and distress. He expelled Vikuks2i from his
<>country for this misdeed. Thus because he had eaten
<>a S4as4a (hare) Vikuks2i got another name S4as4a1da.
<>S4as4a1da not at all caring about the misfortune that be-
<>fell him, went to the forest and lived on fruits and
<>roots and worshipped Devi1, with ardent devotion.
<NI>Iks2va1ku died. S4as4a1da knew this and returned to
<>Ayodhya1 and assumed reign. He performed several [Page855-b+ 63]
<>sacrifices on the banks of river Sarayu1. The famous
<>Kakutstha was the son of this Vikuks2i. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<HI>VIKUN2D2ALA. A Vais4ya who obtained heaven by
<>bathing during the month Ma1gha in the waters of
<>Ka1lindi1. This Vais4ya was a deplorable sinner. Still the
<>men of Ka1la (Yama) sent Vikun2d2ala to heaven without
<>minding his sins. This story occurs in Padma Pura1n2a,
<>A1di Khan2d2a, Chapter 30, as follows:
<NI>In days of old there lived a Vais4ya named Hema-
<>kun2d2ala in the great kingdom of Nis2adha. He was a
<>devotee and worshipper of devas and Bra1hman2as. He
<>carried on trade and agriculture and by plundering
<>he amassed much wealth.
<NI>Hemakun2d2ala grew old. He thought about the frailty
<>of life and spent a sixth part of his wealth for charitable
<>purposes. For remission of the sins committed through-
<>out the whole of his life, he gave alms as stipulated
<>in the Pura1n2as. After entrusting the family affairs to
<>his sons S4ri1kun2d2ala and Vikun2d2ala, he went to the
<>forests for penance.
<NI>His sons were young. They turned away from
<>righteous ways and followed a path of pleasures and
<>wickedness. They refused to pay any heed to the
<>advice of their elders. Drinking and going to other
<>women became their routine.
<NI>Within a short time they lost their wealth. They had
<>nothing to eat. Their friends and favourites all discard-
<>ed them. Being forsaken by every body, they engaged
<>themselves in theft or robbery. They were afraid of
<>the king and the people, and so they shifted to the
<>forest. They lived by hunting. At this time the elder
<>brother was caught by a tiger. The younger brother
<>was bitten by a snake. Thus, on the same day, both
<>sinners met with death. The messengers of Yama took
<>both of them to the world of Yama. According to the
<>order of King Dharma, Vikun2d2ala got heaven and
<>S4ri1 Kun2d2ala got hell.
<NI>Vikun2d2ala who was glad at obtaining heaven asked the
<>men of Yama on the way, why he was given heaven.
<>They replied, “There was a Brahmin who was well-
<>versed in all branches of knowledge. He was the son
<>of Harimitra. His hermitage was on the southern
<>bank of Yamuna1. Yourself and the Brahmin became
<>friends in the forest. Because of that friendship you
<>were enabled to take bath in two Ma1gha months in
<>the holy waters of Ka1lindi1 which is capable of washing
<>all the sins away. By the first Ma1gha bath you got
<>remission of your sins. By the second Ma1gha-bath
<>you became eligible for the attainment of heaven.”

<>to house and ate belly-ful of modakas and returned

<>saw a snake and began to tremble with fear. Due to
<>the shivering of its legs Gan2apati fell down. The belly
<>of Gan2apati was broken due to the fall and a large
<>quantity of modakas came out. Gan2apati gathered
<>everything that fell out of his belly and stuffed them
<>again in the stomach and joining the cut edges entwin-
<>ed the snake tightly round the stomach. Candra who
<>was standing in the sky seeing all these things laughed
<>with contempt. At this, Gan2apati got wild and plucked
<>his tusk and throwing it at the moon cursed him. “Let [Page857-a+ 65]
<>nobody look at you on the Gan2apati-festival day.”
<>(Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a). This story is slightly differ-

<HI>VIPULA II. A mountain near Girivraja, the capital city
<>of Magadha. Mention is made about this mountain in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 21, Stanza 2.
<HI>VIPULA III. A hermit who was born in the dynasty of
<>Bhr2gu. There is a story showing how this hermit protect-
<>ed the wife of his teacher from Indra while he was the
<>disciple of the hermit Devas4arma1, in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 40. The story is given below:
<>Ruci, the wife of the hermit Devas4arma1, was extremely
<>beautiful. Devas4arma1 was aware of the fact that Indra
<>had often looked at his wife with covetous eyes. He had
<>to perform a sacrifice. But he feared that if he went
<>away from the hermitage his wife would be carried away
<>by Indra. At last he called his beloved disciple Vipula
<>and revealed the secret to him. The teacher told his dis-
<>ciple that Indra was a libertine as well as a magician
<>and that he would appear in various forms to entice
<>Ruci, and asked him to protect Ruci even at the cost
<>of his life. Then Devas4arma1 left the hermitage for the
<>sacrifice.
<NI>Vipula followed the wife of his teacher, wherever she
<>went. He feared that Indra might come even unseen by
<>anybody. So he decided to get inside Ruci by super-
<>natural powers of Yoga. He made Ruci to sit in front of
<>him and stare into his eyes and through the rays of her
<>eyes he entered inside her.
<NI>Knowing that Devas4arma1 had left the hermitage, Indra [Page858-b+ 64]
<>came in front of Ruci. By the power of Stambhana
<>(suppressing the use of faculties by mantra) Vipula
<>made Ruci stand motionless staring into the face of
<>Indra. She did not give any reply to the questions of
<>Indra. At last Indra looked into Ruci with inward eyes
<>and saw as in a mirror Vipula sitting inside her. With
<>shame Indra left the place instantly.
<NI>When the teacher returned on completion of the sacri-
<>fice Vipula told him all that had taken place. The
<>teacher was pleased and told his disciple that he might
<>ask for any boon.
<NI>He got the boon to be a righteous man throughout his
<>life and left the hermitage.
<NI>It was during this period that the marriage of Prabha1-
<>vati1, the sister of Ruci, took place. The marriage of
<>Prabha1vati1 with Citraratha, the king of An3ga, was settled.
<>A messenger from An3ga informed Ruci about it. Then
<>some flowers fell from the sky near Ruci. She wore
<>them and went to the marriage. Prabha1vati1 wanted to
<>have the same flowers. Vipula was sent to bring flowers
<>of the same kind. As Vipula was returning with the
<>flowers, he saw two men turning a wheel. Each of them
<>claimed that he had turned more than the other, and
<>quarrelled with each other. One of them pointing at
<>Vipula, said that he who told lies would get what Vipula
<>would undergo in hell. Vipula was worried at hearing
<>this. He proceeded on his journey. He saw six men gamb-
<>ling. One of them pointed at Vipula and said “A false
<>gamester would get what Vipula would get in hell.”
<>Being flurried by these two talks, Vipula ran to his
<>teacher to understand its meaning. He went to Campa1-
<>puri1 and saw the teacher and asked him the meaning of
<>what he had heard. The teacher told him, that the two
<>who turned the wheel were day and night and the six
<>who were engaged in gambling were the six R2tus (sea-
<>sons) and that R2tus and day and night are witnesses of
<>every sinful act committed any time. Vipula became
<>aware of his sin. While he was staying inside the wife of
<>his teacher, his genital touched her genital and face
<>touched face. He had not told the teacher this. But the
<>teacher said that it need not be considered a sin be-
<>cause the deed was done with no bad intention.

<HI>VI1RABHADRA. One of the guards of S4iva.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} There are two different opinions in the Pura1-
<>n2as, regarding the origin of Vi1rabhadra. There is no
<>doubt that his birth was due to the anger of S4iva. When
<>S4iva knew that his wife Pa1rvati1 jumped into the fire and
<>died at the sacrifice of Daks2a, he struck his matted hair
<>on the ground and from that, Vi1rabhadra and Bhadra-
<>ka1li1 came into being. This is the version given in Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7. According to Maha1bha1rata,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 284, Vi1rabhadra was born from
<>the mouth of S4iva. From each of the hairpores of Vi1ra-
<>bhadra, who was born from the mouth of S4iva to destroy
<>the sacrifice of Daks2a a fearful monster was born, all
<>of whom, formed a group of ghosts called the Raumyas.
<NI>2) {%The Destruction of the sacrifice of Daks2a.%} See under
<>Daks2a.
<NI>3) {%Attainment of boon.%} After the destruction of the sacri-
<>fice of Daks2a, the fearful monster Vi1rabhadra, began to
<>exterminate the entire creation. Then S4iva appeared
<>and pacified him and said “You shall become a planet
<>in the sky called An3garaks2aka (Bodyguard) or Man3gala
<>(well being). Everybody will worship you. Those who
<>thus exalt you, will get health, wealth and long life.”
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 7; Va1yu Pura1n2a, 101, 209; Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a, 24).
<NI>After the destruction of the sacrifice of Daks2a, Vi1ra-
<>bhadra severed a portion of his radiance, and from that
<>radiance, later A1dis4an3kara (S4an3kara1ca1rya) was born.
<>This story occurs in Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Pratisarga Parva.
<NI>4) {%Prowess.%} Vi1rabhadra was not only a follower of
<>S4iva. He was a prominent general of the army. In the
<>battle of the burning of Tripura and the Jalandhara
<>fight, Vi1rabhadra stood with S4iva and fought fiercely.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a and Uttara Khan2d2a).
<NI>5) {%Protector of the Devas.%} Vi1rabhadra was the destroyer
<>of the Asuras and the protector of the Devas. Once [Page859-b+ 65]
<>Kas4yapa and all the other hermits and sages with him
<>were burnt to ashes in the wild fire that occurred in the
<>S4aukat2a mountain. Instantly Vi1rabhadra swallowed
<>that wild fire and by the power of incantation, he bro-
<>ught to life from the ashes all the R2s2is (hermits) who
<>were burnt to death.
<NI>On another occasion a serpent swallowed all the gods.
<>Vi1rabhadra killed the snake and rescued all the Devas.
<>Once an asura called Pan5camed2hra put into his mouth
<>all the gods, all the hermits and Ba1li and Sugri1va.
<>Those who escaped from the danger stood agape being
<>powerless to confront the Asura. At last Vi1rabhadra
<>attacked the asura. That great and fierce battle lasted
<>for years. At the end Vi1rabhadra killed the Asura and
<>rescued all.
<NI>Because Vi1rabhadra had thus protected the Devas and
<>the others on three occasions, S4iva became immensely
<>pleased with him and gave him several boons. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, 107).
<HI>VIRA1DHA. A fierce Ra1ks2asa (giant) whom Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a killed in the Dan2d2aka forest. Vira1dha was
<>the rebirth of Tumburu, a Gandharva who had been
<>cursed to become a Ra1ks2asa. The story about S4ri1
<>Ra1ma's liberating the Gandharva from the curse and
<>sending him back to the world of Gandharvas, occurs
<>in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Sargas 2 to 4,
<>as follows.
<NI>In days of old, Tumburu, a Gandharva had been serv-
<>ing Kubera. Once Tumburu was asked by Kubera to
<>bring Rambha1. Tumburu failed in bringing Rambha1
<>at the stipulated time. Kubera got angry and cursed
<>Tumburu to become a Ra1ks2asa. Tumburu requested
<>for liberation from the curse. Kubera granted his
<>request and said “In Treta1yuga, Maha1vis2n2u will
<>incarnate as S4ri1 Ra1ma, who with his sword will change
<>your Ra1ks2asa form. You will regain your former form
<>and will come back to the world of Gandharvas.”
<NI>Accordingly Tumburu took birth as the son of giant
<>Jaya. This child born to Jaya by his wife S4atahrada1,
<>grew up and came to be known by the name Vira1dha.
<>Two extra-ordinarily long hands and the outward
<>appearances of a giant aroused fear in every living
<>creature. He lived in the forest Dan2d2aka. It was at
<>this time that S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a came with Si1ta1,
<>to live in this forest. As soon as Vira1dha saw them he
<>ran to them with a loud cry.
<NI>“With sunken eyes and swollen stomach, widened
<>mouth and an enormous body, with a fierce appearance,
<>of very great height an uncouth figure, body wet with
<>fat, clad in the hide of a leopard, looking like Yama
<>with open mouth, with three lions, two wolves, four
<>leopards, ten spotted deer and the head of a big tusker
<>with tusks smeared with fat, all these caught pierced
<>in an iron trident, and shouting in a roaring sound”,
<>he ran to them and after taking Si1ta1, he began to run.
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a followed him. Vira1dha placed
<>Si1ta1 down and, taking Ra1ma and Laks2man2a on each
<>of his shoulders he began running. Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>cut off each of his hands. But Vira1dha did not die.
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a decided to bury him alive.
<>Vira1dha recognized S4ri1 Ra1ma and told him his story.
<>Instantly his demoniac form changed and he regained
<>his original form of a Gandharva. Thus Tumburu
<>returned to the world of Devas. (See under Tumburu).

<>couple. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a had made himself invisible. So she
<>could not find him. She found out Viraja1. Ra1dha1 open-

<NI>2) {%Other details.%}

<NI>(iv) There is a story about the quest for knowledge
<>about universal and individual souls, by Indra and
<>Virocana, in Cha1ndogyopanis2ad, as given below.
<NI>Once the Devas and the asuras approached Praja1pati
<>to learn about Brahman, the impersonal God. Praja1-
<>pati told them: “A1tman (soul) is the first tattva
<>(Essential being) which is sinless, eternal, desireless
<>and unimaginable in the earth.” Having heard this
<>philosophy about the soul, the Devas selected Indra,
<>and the asuras selected Virocana and to know the
<>details, they sent them to Praja1pati as his disciples.
<NI>Indra and Virocana stayed with Praja1pati for several
<>years to know more about A1tman. But Praja1pati did
<>not reveal to them the secret about Brahman. At last to
<>test them Praja1pati said “Your reflection that you see in
<>water or mirror is the A1tman (soul).”
<NI>Virocana, who mistook what the Praja1pati said as truth
<>immediately took his bath, put on costly dress and orna-
<>ments and stood near water and saw his reflection in water.
<>After that, taking the reflection for soul, he spread this
<>doctrine among his people. With this the asuras accept-
<>ed body as soul. But the Devas did not recognize this
<>philosophy. They accepted the doctrine that A1tman is
<>that essence of Nature which is alien to body and mind
<>and which is pure.
<NI>(v) There are two different statements about the death
<>of Virocana in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>(1) In the battle with Ta1raka1sura, Virocana was killed
<>by Devendra. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 99.
<>Brahma1n2d2a 1. 20. 35; Matsya: 10: 11; Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a 16).
<NI>(2) The Sun God was pleased with Virocana and had
<>given him a crown. The sun told him that death would
<>come only if that crown was removed from the head by
<>some body. Because of this boon Virocana became
<>arrogant. So Maha1vis2n2u took the form of a beautiful
<>woman and enticed Virocana towards him and taking
<>away the crown killed him. (Gan2es4a Pura1n2a 2, 29).
<NI>According to Na1rada Pura1n2a, Maha1vis2n2u took the form
<>of a Brahmin and reached the palace of Virocana. There
<>changing the righteous wife of Virocana into a mad
<>woman he killed Virocana.
<NI>(vi) Virocana had two wives called Vis4a1la1ks2i1 and Devi1.
<>Two children, Bala and Ya odhara1 were born by them.
<>The wife of the famous Tvas2t2a1 was this Yas4odhara1.
<>(Brahma1n2d2a. 3: 1: 86; Na1rada Pura1n2a 2: 32: Bha1ga-

<HI>VIS2N2U.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara
<>are the Lords of creation, sustenance and extermination
<>of this perishable universe. These trimu1rtis (three
<>figures) also are perishable. It is said, that one day of
<>Brahma1 will constitute thousand four-fold (catur) yugas
<>and that during the life of Brahma1, fourteen Indras will
<>fall down from heaven and die. This is a Brahma1 age.
<>The ages of two Brahma1s constitute the age of one Vis2n2u.
<>At the end of the age Vis2n2u also will perish. The age
<>of S4iva is double the age of Vis2n2u. S4iva also will perish
<>at the end of his age. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<NI>When everything perishes there comes the deluge (the
<>great flood). After that, for one hundred and twenty
<>Brahma1 years the universe will be desolate and void. In
<>that deep eternal silence, Vis2n2u will be seen sleeping on
<>a banyan leaf on the surface of water. That is the
<>beginning of the next great age. In this stage, Ba1la-
<>mukunda is the name of Maha1vis2n2u. As he remains on
<>Na1ra or water he will be called Na1ra1yan2a also.
<NI>The name Vis2n2u means he who possesses the habit of
<>Vya1pana (To pervade). While Vis2n2u, who has the
<>power to spread his control over everything in whatever
<>condition, lies on the banyan-leaf. From his navel, a
<>lotus-stalk grows up, and on the top of the stalk, in the
<>lotus flower, Brahma1 comes into being. Brahma1 does
<>penance before Vis2n2u and extols him. Maha1vis2n2u confers
<>on Brahma1 the power of creation of the subjects. That
<>Brahma1 perishes along with the deluge and in his place
<>another Brahma1 is born. Thus in the life-time of Vis2n2u
<>two Brahma1s come into being and perish.
<NI>2) {%Beginning.%} In days of yore, when Vis2n2u was lying
<>on the banyan leaf as Ba1la Mukunda, he began to think
<>“Who am I? Who created me? Why? What have I
<>to perform?” -and soon an ethereal voice was heard,
<>“I am everything. Except me, there is nothing eternal.”
<>From behind the voice Maha1devi1 appeared, and said
<>“Look Vis2n2u. What is there to wonder at? Whenever
<>the universe is subject to creation, sustenance and
<>extermination, you have taken origin by the glory of
<>the Almighty. The Almighty or the omnipotence is
<>beyond attributes. But we are all subjected to attributes.
<>Your foremost attribute is Sattva (goodness-purity)
<>Brahma1 whose main attribute is the attribute of rajas
<>(activity-passions), will originate from your navel.
<>From the middle of the brows of that Brahma1, S4iva
<>will be born, whose main attribute is Tamas (inertia
<>darkness). Brahma1, by the power of Tapas (penance)
<>will acquire the power of creation and build the world.
<>You will be the sustainer of that world. S4iva will dest-
<>roy the same world. I am Devi1 Ma1ya1 (Illusion-
<>personified as the wife of Brahman), the great power
<>depending on you for the purpose of creation.” After
<>hearing these words of Devi1, Vis2n2u went into medita-
<>tion and deep sleep of contemplation.
<NI>3) {%Avata1ras (Incarnations).%} When injustice and law-
<>lessness abound in the universe, Vis2n2u will incarnate in
<>the world in various forms and shapes, and will drive
<>away injustice and will reinstate righteousness. The basis
<>and the indeclinable semen virile of all the incarnations,
<>is this spirit of the universe. All Devas, all human beings
<>and all animals are created from a portion of this soul
<>of the universe, which in itself is a portion. Brahma1,
<>first incarnated as Sanatkuma1ra and lived the life of a
<>Brahmin student of chaste abstinence. The second [Page864-b+ 65]
<>incarnation was connected with the creation of the
<>earth. It was the incarnation as a hog to redeem the
<>earth which was immersed in the world of Rasa1tala.
<>The third incarnation was taken to create the sages and
<>hermits. The Supreme God incarnated as the deva-
<>hermit, Na1rada and taught Pan5cara1tra, the Vais2n2ava-
<>s4a1stra explaining the ways of observing Karmans.
<>Fourthly, Vis2n2u took the incarnation of Nara-Na1ra1y-
<>an2as (two hermits) and performed tapas (penance),
<>difficult to do. The fifth incarnation was that of Kapila
<>who taught his disciple A1suri, a Brahmin, Sa1n3khya (one
<>of the six systems of Indian philosophy dealing with
<>evolution). The next incarnation was taken, according
<>to the request of Atri, as his son under the name
<>Datta1treya. Seventhly he took incarnation as Yajn5a, the
<>son born to Praja1pati Ruci, by his wife A1ku1ti with the
<>groups of devas (gods) such as Ya1mas and others to
<>sustain the Manvantara (age of Manu) of Sva1yam-
<>bhuva. The eighth incarnation was as the son of Bhaga-
<>va1n Na1bhi by his wife Meru, and the ninth was, as the
<>inner soul of Pr2thu, according to the request of the
<>sages and hermits, with a view to change the earth to
<>such a state that medicinal herbs may grow in plenty
<>everywhere. The tenth was, as Matsya (Fish) in
<>Ca1ks2us2a Manvantara deluge; the eleventh, as turtle,
<>to lift up the mountain Mandara; the twelfth as Dhan-
<>vantari, and the thirteenth was as Mohini1 (Charming
<>woman). The fourteenth was that of Man-lion, the
<>fifteenth was that of Va1mana, the sixteenth that of
<>Paras4ura1ma, the seventeenth, that of Vya1sa, the eight-
<>eenth, that of S4ri1 Ra1ma and the nineteenth was that of
<>Ra1ma and the twentieth that of Kr2s2n2a in the dynasty of
<>Vr2s2n2i. The twentyfirst was as Buddha in the beginning
<>of the age of Kali. The twenty second incarnation was
<>in the name of Kalki as the son of the Brahmin Vis2n2u-
<>yas4as. Each incarnation is explained in places where
<>that word occurs. See under Avata1ra.
<NI>The avata1ras of Maha1vis2n2u are numerous. Thousands
<>and thousands of incarnations originate from Maha1-
<>vis2n2u as streams flow from a lake which overflows at all
<>times. Hermits, Manus, Devas, Sons of Manus, Praja1-
<>patis, all these are marks and portions of Maha1vis2n2u.

<NI>4) {%Family life.%} Vaikun2t2ha is the dwelling place of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. Maha1laks2mi1 is the prominent wife. It is seen in
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, that besides Laksmi1devi1,
<>Gan3ga1 Devi1 and Sarasvati1 also were the wives of Vis2n2u.
<>Laks2mi1devi1 has taken several incarnations. Once she
<>took birth from Khya1ti, the wife of hermit Bhrgu. At
<>this birth Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1 were her brothers. On
<>another occasion, she arose from a lotus-flower which
<>grew up from the sea of Milk. (To know more about
<>the wives Laks2mi1, Gan3ga1 and Sarasvati1, see under
<>Gan3ga1).
<NI>There is none to be mentioned as the legitimate son of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. But Brahma1 is the first that could be
<>imagined as the son of Vis2n2u. Besides, Maha1vis2n2u once
<>created a bright son, by his mind. That son was named [Page865-a+ 64]
<>Virajas. S4a1sta1 is another son of Maha1vis2n2u. S4iva be-
<>came amorous with Mohini1 (fascinating woman)--the
<>form which Maha1vis2n2u took at the time of the churning
<>of the Sea of Milk. They led a short family life as a
<>result of which the son S4a1sta1 was born. (See under
<>S4a1sta1).
<NI>5) {%Curses.%} Maha1vis2n2u had cursed and had been cursed
<>on many an occasion. The most important of them are
<>given below:
<NI>(i) {%The curse of Maha1laks2mi1%} Once Maha1vis2n2u looked
<>into the face of Maha1laks2mi1 and laughed for no reason.
<>Thinking that Maha1vis2n2u had been making fun of her,
<>she cursed him saying “Let your head be severed from
<>the body.”
<NI>At this period an Asura named Hayagri1va had done
<>penance for a thousand years and obtained several boons.
<>One boon was that he should be killed only by a man with
<>the head of a horse. Hayagri1va attacked the devas (gods).
<>Though the gods fought with Hayagri1va for many thou-
<>sands of years they could not kill him. Even Vis2n2u,
<>admitted defeat. Using the bow as a prop to his chin he
<>stood thinking, for years. In the meanwhile white ants
<>began to eat the string of the bow. When the string
<>was broken, the bow straightened with a sudden jerk
<>and the head of Maha1vis2n2u was severed from the trunk
<>and was thrown away. Vis4vakarma1 cut off the head of
<>a horse and joined it to the trunk of Vis2n2u, who instant-
<>ly rose up and killed Hayagri1va. Thus satisfying the
<>need of the gods and making the curse of Laks2mi1 come
<>true, Vis2n2u regained his original form and returned to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 1).
<NI>(ii) {%The curse of Bhr2gu.%} The Asuras who were defeated in
<>the war with Devas, approached Puloma1, the mother of
<>their teacher-priest S4ukra, and sought protection. Puloma1,
<>was the wife of hermit Bhr2gu. She began to do penance
<>for the destruction of devas. Knowing this Vis2n2u aimed
<>his weapon, the Discus, at her and killed her. Bhr2gu
<>got angry and cursed Vis2n2u to take birth as a man and
<>suffer the grief of separation from his wife for many
<>years. This curse was the first cause of the incarnation
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma. (For details see under Bhr2gu, Para 4).
<NI>(iii) {%The curse of Vis2n2u.%} Once the handsome King Revan-
<>ta, mounted on the horse Uccais4s4ravas and came to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. Looking at the handsome youth, Laks2mi1
<>stood for a while enchanted by Revanta and his horse.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u was displeased at this, and cursed her to
<>take birth on the earth as a mare. Accordingly she was
<>born as a mare and when the duration of the curse was
<>over returned to Vaikun2t2ha. (For details see under
<>Ekavi1ra).
<NI>(iv) {%The curse of Vr2nda1.%} See under Ma1ya1s4iva.
<NI>6) {%Contests and wars.%} Wars are very few in the Pura1n2as
<>in which Vis2n2u had not participated directly or indirect-
<>ly. As almost all of them have been dealt with in
<>various places in this book, they are not given here.
<>Only a few of the prominent among them are mentioned
<>here.
<NI>(i) {%Madhukait2abhas.%} Madhu and Kait2abha are two
<>asuras born from the ear-wax of Maha1vis2n2u. They
<>tried to attack Brahma1 and Vis2n2u killed them. (See
<>under Kait2abha).
<NI>(ii) {%Killing of Andhaka.%} Andhaka was a notorious asura.
<>He was the minister of Mahis2a1sura. When war broke
<>out between asuras and Devas, Andhaka caused havoc [Page865-b+ 65]
<>among the devas. At last in the fight with Vis2n2u
<>Andhaka was killed. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<NI>(iii) {%Killing of Vr2tra1sura.%} See under Vr2tra.
<NI>(iv) {%Ra1hu.%} For the story of how Vis2n2u cut into two the
<>asura Ra1hu, see under Amr2tam.
<NI>(v) {%Contest with Brahma1.%} The story of Vis2n2u and
<>Brahma1 making a competitive journey to find out the
<>crest and foot of S4iva, is given with slight variations in
<>most of the Pura1n2as. (For detailed story see under
<>Brahma1, Para 5).
<NI>(vi) {%For the story of how Vis2n2u confronted the asuras Nemi,
<>Suma1li1 and Ma1lyava1n%} see under each of those words.
<NI>7) {%The weapons and ornaments of Vis2n2u.%} The following
<>are the prominent ornaments and weapons of Vis2n2u.
<NI>(i) {%S4ri1vatsa.%} This is a mark on the chest. It is said that
<>this is the mark imprinted by the angry Bhr2gu who
<>kicked on the chest of Maha1vis2n2u. (See under Bhr2gu).
<NI>(ii) {%Pa1n5cajanya.%} This is a white conch. Even by the
<>touch of this conch man becomes wise. (For further
<>details see under Pan5caja I).
<NI>(iii) {%The Discus Sudars4ana.%} Vajrana1bha is another
<>name of this weapon. Vis2n2u uses this weapon to deal
<>with fierce enemies. This is a wheel with a hole in the
<>centre and thousand arms going out from the centre.
<>The outer edge is sharp. This Sudars4ana Cakra
<>is operated by putting it on the first finger and turning
<>it round, and releasing it at the enemy. Though it is
<>terrible for the wicked and unjust, it forebodes good to
<>good people and so it is Sudars4ana (good to look at).
<NI>(iv) {%Kaumodaki1.%} This is the club. The syllable “Ku”
<>means the earth. Kumodaka means he who delights
<>the earth. He who makes the earth delightful is Vis2n2u.
<>As the club is the property of Kumodaka (Vis2n2u) it is
<>called Kaumodaki1.
<NI>(v) {%Kaustubha.%} This is the jewel of Maha1vis2n2u. (Ku =
<>the Earth. Stubhna1ti = Pervades (spreads). Kustubha =
<>ocean. Kaustubha-obtained from the sea. This jewel
<>obtained from the sea of milk at the time of its churn-
<>ing, is worn by Maha1vis2n2u on his neck. This is a red
<>Jacinth.
<NI>(vi) {%Nandaka.%} This is the sword of Vis2n2u. It is stated
<>in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 166, that this
<>sword was obtained from Indra.
<NI>(vii) {%S4a1ran3g.%} This is the name of the bow of Vis2n2u.
<>This is called Vais2n2avaca1pa (the bow of Vis2n2u) also.
<>A description is given in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la-
<>ka1n2d2a, Sarga 25, as to how this bow was obtained. It
<>is as follows:
<NI>Once the Devas made Vis2n2u and S4iva quarrel with each
<>other, to test their might. The fight between the two
<>began. Vis4vakarma1 gave each of them a bow. The bow
<>of Vis2n2u was called Vais2n2avaca1pa; the bow of S4iva
<>was called S4aivaca1pa. This Vais2n2avaca1pa is S4a1rn3ga.
<>Due to the power of S4a1rn3ga, S4iva was defeated in the
<>fight. Getting angry S4iva gave his bow to the King
<>Devara1ta of Videha. It was this bow that S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>broke at the time of the Svayam3vara marriage of Si1ta1.
<NI>After the fight, Vis2n2u gave his bow to R2ci1ka. That bow
<>changed hands from R2ci1ka to Jamadagni and from him
<>to Paras4ura1ma, who presented this bow to S4ri1 Ra1ma on
<>his return after the marriage with Si1ta1.
<NI>(viii) {%Vaijayanti1.%} This is the necklace of Vis2n2u. This
<>necklace, made of five jewels stuck together, is known
<>by the name Vanama1la1, also. Vis2n2u has a charioteer
<>named Da1ruka and four horses named S4aibya, Sugri1va, [Page866-a+ 64]
<>Meghapus2pa and Vala1haka. Garud2a is the conveyance
<>of Vis2n2u. He holds conch, discus, club and lotus in
<>each of his four hands. It is said that the discus was
<>made by Vis4vakarma1 with the dust of the Sun. In
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a particular mention is made about the
<>ornaments of Vis2n2u.

<>Vis2n2u is only a lesser god. The story of Trivikrama is
<>hinted in R2gveda. But there is no mention about the
<>incarnation of Va1mana or Maha1bali. R2gveda gives
<>Maha1vis2n2u only the position of a younger brother of
<>Indra. That is why the author of Amarakos4a has given
<>Vis2n2u synonyms such as Upendra, Indra1varaja etc.
<NI>(ii) Maha1vis2n2u was one of those who came to see

<HI>VIS2N2UCITTA. A noble Vais2n2avite devotee, who lived
<>in Tamil Nadu. He lived in Villiputtur. It is said that
<>he was the incarnation of Garud2a. Vis2n2ucitta had ano-
<>ther name Periya1lva1r. A1n2d2a1l who was famous among
<>the A1lva1rs was the daughter of Vis2n2ucitta.
<NI>Vis2n2ucitta sang holy hymns in praise of the beloved
<>god. The hymns of praise he sang are called Palla1n2d2u.
<>He got the name Periya1lva1r or the foremost of the devo-
<>tees.
<NI>Once at Villiputtur, while he was getting beds ready to
<>plant holy basil, he was attracted by a divine infant. It
<>seemed to Vis2n2ucitta that the little girl was lying among
<>the basil plants. He took the child home and named
<>her Goda1. It was this Goda1 who became the famous
<>A1n2d2a1l later. Legends say that the birth of A1n2d2a1l was
<>in 97 Kali Era. Scholars say that Goda1 was born in the
<>middle of 7th century. There is another story which
<>mentions that A1n2d2a1l was born from a portion of
<>Goddess Earth.
<HI>VIS2N2UDA1SA. A Vais2n2avite devotee who lived in ancient
<>days. The story of this devotee who defeated his king
<>Cola in devotion to Vis2n2u, is given in Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 110. The story is as follows.
<NI>In days of old there was a king named Cola in Ka1n5ci1-
<>pura. It was because of his reign that the country got
<>the name Cola. He had performed several sacrifices.
<>On the banks of the river Ta1mraparn2i1, stood his golden
<>Yu1pas (pegs on which sacrificial animals were tied)
<>that the place looked like Caitraratha.
<NI>Once the king went to the temple and worshipped
<>Vis2n2u by offering flowers of gold and jewels such as
<>chalcedony and prostrated before Vis2n2u and rose up.
<>At that time a Brahmin named Vis2n2uda1sa from his own
<>city came there to worship, with holy basil and water
<>as offerings. He worshipped with the leaves and flower-
<>bunches of holy basil. Because of his worship by holy
<>basil, the king's worship by jewels, was dimmed. The
<>emperor got angry and said, “Vis2n2uda1sa, you are a poor
<>man who does not know how to worship Vis2n2u. What
<>merit has your worship of holy basil after mine of
<>jewels?” Both began to contest on this point. At last the
<>king said “Let us see who between us will get oneness
<>with Vis2n2u first, you or I”
<NI>After saying this the king went to his palace. He appoint-
<>ed Mudgala the high priest and began to perform a
<>sacrifice to Vis2n2u. The sacrifice was going on with
<>pomp and festivities. Vis2n2uda1sa also was immersed in
<>devotion to Vis2n2u to the best of his abilities.
<NI>Once Visn2uda1sa, after his usual prayer and meditation
<>prepared rice-food. But somebody took away the cook-
<>ed rice unseen by Vis2n2uda1sa. Fearing that he would
<>miss the time for his evening prayer, he did not think
<>of cooking food again. Next day also he cooked food
<>and went for evening prayer. On that day also the rice
<>was stolen. This continued. One day after cooking the
<>food, Vis2n2uda1sa waited close by in a hidden corner. He
<>saw a low-caste man who was a mere skeleton because of [Page867-b+ 65]
<>famine, stealing the cooked rice and feeling pity on him
<>he said, “Stop, stop. How can you eat it without any oily
<>thing? See, take this ghee also.” Saying so he drew
<>near. The out-caste was terrified at this and ran away.
<>On the way he stumbled and fell. Vis2n2uda1sa ran to
<>the spot and fanned him with his cloth. When he rose
<>up the figure in the place of the low-caste was that of
<>the real S4ri1 Na1ra1yan2a with conch, discus and club held
<>in his hands. Because of devotion Vis2n2uda1sa stood be-
<>numbed. While the King Cola and the people were look-
<>ing on, Vis2n2uda1sa got into the divine Vima1na and went
<>to the world of Vis2n2u.
<HI>VIS2N2UDATTA. Son of the Brahmin named Vasudatta.
<>The story of Vis2n2udatta is quoted to prove that bad
<>omens at the beginning of a journey is a warning that
<>the journey would not be fruitful and that it would be
<>rather dangerous.
<NI>When Vis2n2udatta became sixteen years old he decided
<>to go to the city of Valabhi1 for his education. Seven Brah-
<>min boys of his age gathered together and joined him.
<>Deciding not to separate from each other, they started for
<>Valabhi1, without the knowledge of their parents. When
<>they proceeded a little further they saw a bad omen.
<>Vis2n2udatta stood undecided, but the others pressed him
<>on and they continued their journey. Next day by even-
<>ing they reached a village of forest tribes. After walking
<>through the village they reached the house of a woman.
<>They got her permission to stay there for the night.
<>They all lay in a corner. Immediately all slept. Vis2n2u-
<>datta alone lay awake. When the night advanced, a
<>man entered the house. The woman and the man
<>talked for a while and carried on sexual sports, and
<>they lay together and slept. A light was burning in the
<>room. Vis2n2udatta saw everything through the cleavage
<>of the shutters, and thought. “I am sorry that we have
<>come to this house. He is not her husband. Sure! she is
<>a harlot.” As he was thinking thus, foot-steps were
<>heard in the courtyard. A young man fixed his
<>servants in their places. Then he entered the house and
<>saw Vis2n2udatta and his friends. The new-comer was
<>also a forest-man. He had a sword in his hand. He was
<>the owner of the house. Vis2n2udatta said that they were
<>travellers. When he heard it, without saying anything
<>he got inside and saw his wife sleeping with her lover.
<>With the sword in his hand, he cut off the head of the
<>lover. He did not kill the woman, who did not know
<>that her lover was killed. The forester laid the sword
<>down and lay in the same bed and slept. The light was
<>burning.
<NI>After a while the woman woke up, and saw her hus-
<>band who had cut her lover into two. She stood up
<>quickly and took the trunk of her lover and placed it
<>on her shoulder and taking the head in one hand, went
<>out and hid them in the pile of ashes. Then she return-
<>ed and lay down. Vis2n2udatta had followed her steal-
<>thily and seen what she had done. He also returned and
<>sat in the midst of his friends. She rose up and took the
<>sword of her husband and killed him with it. Then
<>coming out she cried aloud. “Oh dear! These travellers
<>have killed my husband.” The servants woke up and
<>came to the house and saw their master lying dead.
<>They tried to attack Vis2n2udatta and his friends.
<>Vis2n2udatta told them everything that he had seen, and
<>showed them the head and the trunk of her lover, hid-
<>den in the ashes. When they saw this they understood [Page868-a+ 64]
<>everything. They tried the woman. At last she admitted
<>the crime. They expelled her and drove her away. After
<>this the travellers returned to their homes. (Katha1sarit-
<>sa1gara, Madanaman5cuka1lambaka, Taran3ga 6).
<HI>VIS2N2UDHARMA1. A child of Garud2a. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Stanza 13).
<HI>VIS2N2UJVARA. A great disease used by people to defeat

<>kinds of ornaments, and the most famous sculptor. He
<>was the maker of all the aerial chariots of the Devas.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>2) {%Children.%} Though mention is made about many
<>children of Vis4vakarma1 in Various Pura1n2as, five sons
<>and four daughters are mostly spoken of. When Maha1-
<>vis2n2u took the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma for a stipulated

<>said that in this way there are one hundred Rudras with
<>shining radiance.
<NI>The daughters of Vis4vakarma1:--The four prominent
<>daughters are Sam3jn5a1, Citra1n3gada1, Suru1pa1 and Bar-
<>his2mati1. The Sun married Sam3jn5a1. Sun got three
<>children, Manu, Yama and Yami1 by Sam3jn5a1. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3, Chapter 2). Priyavrata, the brother
<>of Utta1napa1da, married Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1. Of these
<>the first wife gave birth to ten sons named Agni1dhra,
<>Idhmajihva, Yajn5aba1hu, Maha1vi1ra, Rukmas4ukra,
<>Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1tithi, Vi1tihotra and Kavi
<>and last of all a daughter named U1rjjasvati1. Of these
<>Kavi, Savana and Maha1vi1ra became abstemious and
<>well-versed in Brahmavidya1 (theosophy). By the other
<>wife three other sons Uttama, Ta1masa and Raivata were
<>born to Priyavrata. These grew up to be famous and
<>gradually became lords of Manvantaras. This Priya-
<>vrata lived with his sons and ruled over the country
<>for eleven Arbuda ages (Arbuda = ten crores). In
<>spite of his old age, his faculties or his body did not
<>become weak. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>Citra1n3gada1 was the fourth daughter of Vis4vakarma1.
<>Ghr2ta1ci1 was her mother. The young and beautiful
<>Citra1n3gada1 one day went to bathe in the river in the
<>Naimis2a forest. When she got into the water the prince
<>Suratha, the son of King Sudeva came there. Their eyes
<>met. Both fell in love with each other. In spite of the
<>advice of her maids she succumbed to the desire of the
<>King. Knowing this her angry father Vis4vakarma1 came
<>to her and said, “Since you have deviated from the path
<>of righteousness and abandoned your soul to a libertine,
<>you will not have marriage, and hence you will not
<>enjoy the pleasures of having a husband or child.” As
<>soon as she was cursed, the river Sarasvati1 carried the
<>prince Suratha thirteen yojanas down along with her
<>current. Because the King was washed away by the
<>current Citra1n3gada1 fell down unconscious. The maids
<>sprinkled the water from the river Sarasvati1 on her face.
<>Still she lay there as dead. Thinking that she was dead,
<>her maids went in different ways to fetch firewood and
<>fire. When the maids were gone, she came to herself
<>and looked on all sides. Seeing none of her maids in
<>the vicinity, she felt miserable and jumped into the river
<>Sarasvati1, and the current carried her down and pushed
<>her into the great river Gomati1. Being aware of her
<>future, the great river Gomati1 pushed her down and
<>placed her in a big forest where lions, leopards, tigers
<>etc. lived in plenty.
<NI>A Guhyaka (a section of Yaks2as) who was going
<>through the sky, saw Citra1n3gada1 in the forest, and in
<>reply to his enquiry she told her story to him. Guhyaka
<>blessed her and advised her to go to the temple close
<>by and to worship S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara, so that every thing
<>might end well. Accordingly Citra1n3gada1 reached S4ri1-
<>kan2t2hes4vara on the south of Ka1lindi1, bathed in the
<>Yamuna1 at noon and went to the temple and bowed
<>before S4ri1kan2t2ha Mahes4vara.
<NI>At that time the hermit R2tadhvaja, well-versed in
<>Sa1maveda came there to bathe. The hermit called
<>Citra1n3gada1 and enquired about her. She told the hermit
<>all that had happened to her. Hearing her story, the
<>hermit became angry and cursed Vis4vakarma1. “Let
<>that Vis4vakarma1 who has behaved so cruelly towards
<>his own daughter become a monkey.” Then he called
<>Citra1n3gada1 and said to her. “Good girl, go to the holy [Page870-b+ 65]
<>place called Saptagoda1vara and worship Ha1t2akes4vara
<>Maha1deva. Devavati1, the daughter of the asura
<>Kanda1rama1li1 the hermit woman Damayanti1, the
<>daughter of A1n5jana, a Guhyaka, and Vedavati1 the
<>daughter of Parjanya would come there. At the
<>time when these three young women meet together
<>at Ha1t2akes4vara, you will unite with your husband.”
<>Being overjoyed at the words of the hermit, Citra1n3gada1
<>went to Saptagoda1vara, lived there and worshipped S4iva.
<>R2tadhvaja went on his way.
<NI>Vis4vakarma1, transformed into a huge monkey, was
<>causing havoc and devastation in the forest. Once the
<>five-year-old son of R2tadhvaja, called Ja1ba1li had gone
<>to bathe in the river. The Vis4vakarma1 monkey chased
<>this boy and caught him and taking him to the top of
<>a Banyan tree, placed him close to the branches and
<>tied him fast with creepers. After this the monkey went
<>to Maha1meru. As the second adventure, the monkey
<>separated Damayanti1 from her father An5jana, a
<>Guhyaka. Damayanti1 was born to An5jana by the
<>celestial maid Pramloca1. Hermit Mudgala had once
<>prophesied that this Damayanti1 would become the
<>prominent wife of a King. The delighted Damayanti1
<>was once about to get into the water of the holy bath
<>Hiran2vati1, with her maids when the Vis4vakarma1-monkey
<>ran to the spot and the terrified Damayanti1 jumped
<>into the river and was carried down by the current. She
<>floated down and got into a forest. It was in this forest
<>that Ja1ba1li was tied to the banyan branches. Damayanti1
<>saw Ja1ba1li. Each said to the other about the cruel deeds
<>of the monkey. After that according to the advice of
<>Ja1ba1li, Damayanti1 went to the temple of S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara
<>on the basin of the river Yamuna1. After worshipping
<>S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara, she wrote on the wall of the temple,
<>a poem about the misfortunes of herself and Ja1ba1li and
<>stayed in that place engaged in worshipping god.
<NI>The next confrontation of the monkey was with Vedavati1
<>the daughter of Parjanya. Vedavati1 was born to
<>Parjanya by a celestial woman Ghr2ta1ci1. Once while
<>Vedavati1 was playing in the forest, the monkey saw her.
<>He addressed her Devavati1, intentionally mispronouncing
<>her name. She replied, “You monkey. I am not
<>Devavati1, I am Vedavati1.” Instantly the monkey ran to
<>her. Vedavati1 quickly climbed on a hibiscus tree. The
<>monkey kicked at the tree and broke it. Vedavati1 held
<>fast to a strong branch of the tree. The monkey took
<>the branch and threw it on to the sea. Every movable
<>and immovable thing in the world thought a tree was
<>falling down from the sky. Seeing Vedavati1 falling
<>down, a Gandharva said, “Oh dear, Brahma1 himself
<>had said once that this damsel would become the chief
<>wife of Indradyumna, the famous hero, the son of Manu
<>the great King who has completed thousand ya1gas
<>(sacrifices).”
<NI>Hearing the words of the Gandharva, Indradyumna the
<>son of Manu, broke that branch into thousand pieces
<>by his arrows. Though the branch was destroyed, Indra-
<>dyumna could not find where Vedavati1 had fallen. She
<>floated into a part of the forest. All alone she walked
<>on and on and reached the temple of S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara,
<>on the bank of Yamuna1. Damayanti1 who had
<>reached the temple earlier and Vedavati1 met each other
<>and talked about their experiences. Thus due to the
<>wickedness of the Vis4vakarma1-monkey Ja1ba1li the son of
<>R2tadhvaja came to be tied, on to the banyan tree and [Page871-a+ 65]
<>Damayanti1 and Vedavati1 to be staying helpless in the
<>temple of S4ri1kan2thes4vara.
<NI>At this time the hermit Ga1lava reached the temple of
<>S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara. He saw Damayanti1 and Vedavati1 and
<>felt pity on them. Next day Ga1lava started for Sapta-
<>goda1vara to take a bath in Ka1rttika. Damayanti1 and
<>Vedavati1 followed the hermit. They reached Sapta-
<>goda1vara and dipped in Pus2kara bath. Under water
<>they saw several Virgin fishes gathered round a whale
<>begging him for love. The whale was saying harsh
<>words to them rejecting their request. The fish virgins
<>again told the whale. “Don't you see the hermit Ga1lava
<>going about with two beautiful damsels. If this right-
<>eous hermit does not fear slander, why should you, who
<>live under water fear it?” The whale replied. “Ga1lava
<>doesn't fear people because he is daring and blind with
<>love.” Hearing these words of the fishes, Ga1lava
<>became ashamed of himself. So without coming up he
<>stayed under water. The two girls finished bath and
<>got on the bank, and waited for Ga1lava. Vis4vakarma1's
<>daughter Citra1n3gada1, who had reached the place
<>earlier, met the two girls. They told each other their
<>stories. “As R2tadhvaja had prophesied, Damayanti1
<>the daughter of An5jana and Vedavati1 the daughter of
<>Parjanya have arrived.” Thought Citra1n3gada1. “If
<>Devavati1 the daughter of the asura Kanda1rama1li1, also is
<>come, I could unite with my husband Suratha.” Citra1-
<>n3gada1 became glad. At this time Devavati1, the daughter
<>of Kanda1rama1li1, ran to the spot, being chased by the
<>Vis4vakarma1 monkey.
<NI>The reader might remember that Damayanti1 had written
<>a poem on the wall of the temple at S4ri1kan2t2hes4vara
<>when she had gone there at the instruction of Ja1ba1li who
<>had been tied on to a branch of a tree. At noon on that
<>day R2tadhvaja had gone to the temple at S4ri1kan2t2hes4-
<>vara and happened to see the poem. Then only did he
<>understand that his son Ja1ba1li had been tied to a tree
<>by a monkey. By then five hundred years had elapsed.
<>R2tadhvaja was aware of the fact that the only person
<>capable of liberating Ja1ba1li, was S4akuni the son of Iks2v-
<>a1ku. R2tadhvaja reached Ayodhya1 instantly and told Iks2v-
<>a1ku. “Oh, mighty King! hear me, please! A monkey
<>has made my virtuous and learned son Ja1ba1li, a captive
<>and bound him on a tree, within the boundary of your
<>kingdom. Nobody in the world except your son S4akuni
<>will be capable of rescuing him.” S4akuni accompanied
<>R2tadhvaja to the forest. They saw the tall huge banyan
<>tree with bulky roots hanging on all sides and on the
<>top of the tree, on a lofty place, the son of R2tadhvaja
<>entangled and entwined by creepers. Seeing the net-
<>work of creepers around the body of the hermit's son,
<>S4akuni began to send arrows one after another and cut
<>off all the creeper's knots. R2tadhvaja climbed up the
<>tree. Seeing his father, Ja1ba1li bowed his head to his
<>father. R2tadhvaja was not capable of extricating his
<>son. The prince put down his bow and arrow and tried
<>to untie the knots of the creepers that held his body to
<>the branch. Though a sturdy man he could not do it.
<>At last they cut the branch close to his body and got
<>Ja1ba1li down. A piece of the branch was stuck to his
<>back. Thus with his son Ja1ba1li bearing a piece of lum-
<>ber on his back and S4akuni bearing bow and arrows,
<>R2tadhvaja came to Ka1lindi1.
<NI>R2tadhvaja, S4akuni and Ja1ba1li wandered about for years
<>in search of Damayanti1 and the others. After nearly a [Page871-b+ 64]
<>hundred years, with despair Ja1ba1li bearing the lumber
<>on his back, went with his father to Kosala. The king
<>of that country was Indradyumna, the son of Manu. He
<>welcomed the hermit with hospitality. R2tadhvaja talked
<>about Damayanti1. Indradyumna claimed that he had
<>once saved a young woman by his arrows from the
<>branch of a tree. They all started in search of the girls.
<>They reached Badarya1s4rama, where they saw a young
<>hermit. From the conversation it was revealed that the
<>young hermit was Suratha. When he learned everything
<>he stopped penance and accompanied them. Under the
<>leadership of R2tadhvaja, they reached Saptagoda1vara
<>and saw Citra1n3gada1.
<NI>In the meanwhile Ghr2ta1ci1, sad and miserable, was wan-
<>dering over the mountain of the rising sun, searching
<>for her lost daughter Citra1n3gada1. She met the cursed
<>monkey form of Vis4vakarma1 and asked it, “Oh! monkey!
<>have you seen a girl?” The monkey told her every thing
<>that took place. Ghr2ta1ci1 also reached Saptagoda1vara.
<>The monkey followed close behind her. As soon as
<>Ja1ba1li saw the monkey he got angry and jumped
<>forward to wreak vengeance. R2tadhvaja checked his
<>son and told him the history of Vis4vakarma1. The monkey
<>separated the piece of the branch from the back of
<>Ja1ba1li, who had been bearing it on his back for the last
<>thousand years. R2tadhvaja was immensely pleased at
<>this and asked the monkey what boon he wanted. The
<>monkey said. “Brahman, if you wish to give me a boon,
<>please recall your curse. Great hermit! I am Vis4vakarma1
<>the father of Citra1n3gada1. I became a monkey because
<>of your curse. Let all the sins I have incurred because
<>of the mischief of a monkey, be remitted.” Hearing
<>this R2tadhvaja said. “Your curse will end when you get
<>a strong and sturdy son by Ghr2ta1ci1.”
<NI>Hearing this Ghr2ta1ci1 rose up in the sky. The monkey
<>also jumped up and followed her. The monkey was
<>attracted by the beauty of Ghr2ta1ci1. Later, on the
<>mountain named Kola1hala, the monkey enticed Ghr2ta1ci1
<>and wooed her. She consented and they lived thus for
<>a long time. Then they went to the Vindhya mountain.
<>On the bank of the Goda1vari1, a sturdy son was born to
<>them. This son was the strong sturdy huge monkey Nala,
<>who helped S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<NI>On the birth of a son Vis4vakarma1 regained his former
<>form. He returned to Saptagoda1vara with Ghr2ta1ci1.
<>Ga1lava also came there. With the hermit Ga1lava at
<>the head, the priests made burnt offerings and began the
<>performance of the marriage ceremony. The Gandharvas
<>sang and the celestial maids danced. The first marriage
<>was between Devavati1 the daughter of Kanda1rama1li1 and
<>Ja1ba1li. Then Indradyumna married Vedavati1. Next,
<>S4akuni married Damayanti1, the daughter of An5jana,
<>and lastly Suratha married Citra1n3gada1. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 63 and 64).

<NI>The hermit Vasis2t2ha erected his hermitage and did
<>penance in the country of Vis4va1mitra. Once, while
<>engaged in hunting Vis4va1mitra saw Nandini1 in the
<>hermitage of Vasis2t2ha, and wanted to have her. In the
<>battle which ensued between Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra,
<>the hermit Vasis2t2ha came out victorious. The ashamed
<>Vis4va1mitra gave up his kingdom and went to forest
<>to do penance. Vis4va1mitra became a royal hermit of
<>great attainments. There were constant confrontations
<>between the Ra1jars2i and the Brahmars2i (King-hermit
<>and Brahmin-hermit). (For the detailed story of the
<>quarrels between Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha see under
<>Vasis2t2ha, para 2).
<NI>4) {%Vis4va1mitra and Haris4candra.%} The histories of Vis4va1-
<>mitra, Vasis2t2ha and Haris4candra are intertwined as a
<>triple string. Vis4va1mitra made Haris4candra, the most
<>renowned of the men of veracity, go begging.
<NI>Haris4candra and Vis4va1mitra. Their history begins from
<>King Tris4an3ku of the Solar dynasty.
<NI>Formerly the name of Tris4an3ku was Satyavrata. Arun2a
<>was the father of Satyavrata. When Arun2a was reigning
<>the prince Satyavrata was leading a wicked life. He
<>once entered the wedding hall of a Brahmin and carried
<>away the bride by force. When the king knew this, he
<>expelled the prince from the palace. Vasis2t2ha, as the
<>family priest, was behind the cruelty on the part of the
<>king towards his son. It was because of this that Vis4va1-
<>mitra crossed the path of Satyavrata.
<NI>Satyavrata went to the forest and lived like a low-caste
<>man. King Arun2a repented his rashness. Entrusting his
<>kingdom to Vasis2t2ha, Arun2a went to the forest to do pen-
<>ance. For twelve years there was no rain in the country.
<>Famine broke out. Vis4va1mitra's wife and three children
<>were in great difficulty. The hermit had been engaged
<>in penance. So the wife of the hermit decided to sell
<>the middle son for the sake of maintaining the rest and
<>started for the market with her children. On
<>the way Satyavrata met them and learned the whole
<>story. He told her not to sell the child. He agreed to
<>give them food till the arrival of Vis4va1mitra. The agree-
<>ment was that he would tie the meat, obtained by hunt-
<>ing, to a tree outside the hermitage, every day. Satya-
<>vrata carried out the promise. One day he did not get
<>anything from hunting. He caught hold of Vasis2t2ha's
<>cow which had been grazing in the forest and killed it
<>and gave its flesh to the family of Vis4va1mitra. On com-
<>ing to know this Vasis2t2ha cursed him and changed his
<>form into that of a can2d2a1la (low-caste). Moreover, as
<>he had incurred three sins such as stealing of a bride,
<>anger of father and cow-slaughter, he came to be
<>called Tris4an3ku from that day onwards. Weighed down
<>by these sins, he tried to commit suicide. Devi1 appeared
<>before him and gave him back his original form and
<>his kingdom.
<NI>After the death of Arun2a, Tris4an3ku assumed the reign.
<>Haris4candra was his son. After giving the country to his
<>son, Tris4an3ku requested Vasis2t2ha to perform the sacrifice
<>to send him to heaven bodily. Vasis2t2ha said that it was
<>impossible for him. Vasis2t2ha's enemy Vis4va1mitra took
<>up the task. He lifted Tris4an3ku bodily, up to heaven.
<>But he was denied admittance in heaven and so Vis4va1-
<>mitra created an artificial heaven between the earth
<>and heaven and made Tris4an3ku stay there.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra was keeping up hostile attitude towards the [Page873-a+ 65]
<>kings of the Solar dynasty. In reality it was not the
<>hostility towards the Solar dynasty, but it was his
<>enmity against Vasis2t2ha. Vis4va1mitra did not like
<>Vasis2t2ha's being the family-priest of the kings of the
<>Solar dynasty. So Vis4va1mitra kept up an attitude of
<>antipathy towards them. This is the background of the
<>quarrel between Haris4candra and Vis4va1mitra.
<NI>Haris4candra took Candramati1, the daughter of S4ibi,
<>as his first wife. Besides her, he had ninetynine wives.
<>But they had no children. At last according to the
<>advice of Vasis2t2ha he went to the basin of the Ganges
<>and did penance before Varun2a. Vis4va1mitra did not
<>like this. Varun2a appeared and said that Haris4candra
<>would get a son. The king had promised that he would
<>give his son as a sacrificial animal to Varun2a.
<NI>Candramati1 became pregnant and delivered a son. He
<>was named Rohita1s4va. Even after the lapse of a month,
<>the son was not given to Varun2a. On several occasions
<>Varun2a demanded the child; and Haris4candra would
<>give some excuses. Finally the king agreed to hand
<>him over to Varun2a at the age of eleven after his
<>Upanayana (investiture with the Brahma string). The
<>boy completed his tenth year. Preparations were being
<>made in the palace, for Upanayana, when Varun2a
<>arrived. The prince, who was aware of the fact that his
<>father would sacrifice him after his Upanayana, ran
<>away from the palace at night. Varun2a asked the king
<>to hand over the boy to him. The king was in great
<>perplexity. Varun2a cursed the king that he would catch
<>the disease called Jalodara (dropsy). Thus the king be-
<>came a sick man. Rohita1s4va heard from travellers that
<>his father was ill. On many occasions he wanted to
<>return to the palace. But Indra appeared before him in
<>the form of a Brahmin and dissuaded him from
<>going to the palace.
<NI>Haris4candra called Vasis2t2ha and asked him to suggest
<>a remedy for this woe and misery. Vasis2t2ha advised
<>him to fulfil somehow or other, the promise made to
<>Varun2a. The hermit continued. “Sons are of ten types.
<>A son bought for price also is included in this. So it
<>is enough if a son is bought for price and is sacrificed.
<>Some Brahmin may be found, who will be willing to sell
<>his son. If you please Varun2a thus, you will be cured.”
<NI>The King was delighted to hear this. He instruct-
<>ed his minister to find out any Brahmin who was will-
<>ing to sell his son. A greedy Brahmin was found out.
<>His name was Aji1garta. He had three sons. He was
<>prepared to sell the second son, S4unas4s4epha. The minister
<>agreed to give him hundred cows in return.
<NI>Up to this time Vis4va1mitra had been waging only a
<>shadow war against the Kings of the Solar dynasty.
<>From this moment he entered the scene of war. The
<>minister bought S4unas4s4epha and brought him to the
<>palace. Vis4va1mitra also arrived at the palace. He
<>sympathised with S4unas4s4epha who was crying pitiably.
<>He asked the King to release the boy, and gave a
<>warning that if the boy was not set free, the sacrifice
<>would be obstructed. The King said that he was doing
<>so to get recovery from illness, that he would give Vis4va1-
<>mitra a good deal of wealth, and requested him not to
<>cause any hindrance to the sacrifice. These words and
<>the misery of the boy kindled the anger of Vis4va1mitra.
<>He called S4unas4s4epha and taught him Varun2amantra
<>(spell) and told him to repeat the mantra when he was
<>lying on the slaughter-stone and that he would escape [Page873-b+ 65]
<>death. S4unas4s4epha did as he was told. Varun2a became
<>pleased with him and appearing before the King said,
<>“Leave S4unas4s4epha and perform the sacrifice. You will
<>get recovery.” Saying so Varun2a disappeared. Immedi-
<>ately the King was cured of his disease. At the order of
<>the King S4unas4s4epha was set free. The sound ‘Jaya Jaya’
<>(victory) reverberated in the sacrificial hall. S4unas4s4epha
<>got up and asked. “Oh great men. Who is my father
<>now? Some said that it was Aji1garta. Some others
<>argued that it was Haris4candra. Some said that it was
<>Varun2a.” At this time Vasis2t2ha stood up and said.
<>“Oh, great men, please stop arguing. I shall give reply
<>in accordance with the convention of Vedas. When he
<>bargained on the price of his son and received the cost
<>Aji1garta lost his paternity. Thenceforward Haris4candra
<>who bought the boy became his father. From the
<>moment he had issued orders to bind the boy and place
<>him on the slaughter-stone, he also had lost his paternity.
<>The claim of Varun2a to his paternity, because the boy
<>had been saved from death by him, does not hold good.
<>Any god will be pleased, when praised and glorified
<>with great laudatory mantras and will confer upon the
<>supplicant wealth, life, cow, land, salvation etc. There
<>is nothing unusual in this. But it was Vis4va1mitra who
<>taught him the Varun2a-spell in his pitiable and danger-
<>ous situation. So Vis4va1mitra alone has claim to the
<>boy's paternity.”
<NI>Those who were present, accepted this decision.
<>Immediately Vis4va1mitra took S4unas4s4epha with him and
<>went to his hermitage. Hearing about the recovery of
<>the King, Rohita1s4va returned to the palace from the
<>forest. Haris4candra received him with tears of joy. The
<>King, with his wife and son led a happy life and ruled
<>over his subjects with justice and truth. At this time,
<>Haris4candra (of Kakutstha's family) accepting Vasis2t2ha
<>as the main priest performed the famous sacrifice of
<>Ra1jasu1ya (Royal) consecration with ceremonies and
<>festivities. With this the fame of Haris4candra spread
<>far and wide.
<NI>At this point begins the next stage of confrontation
<>between Vis4va1mitra and Haris4candra. Vasis2t2ha once
<>reached heaven. Vis4va1mitra also reached there at the
<>same time. The devas greeted both honourably. But
<>Vis4va1mitra saw that Vasis2t2ha was shown some parti-
<>ality. This was unpalatable to Vis4va1mitra, who asked
<>Vasis2t2ha. “What excellence have you, more than I?”
<>Vasis2t2ha replied. ‘Have you not heard about Haris4-
<>candra, the King of the Solar dynasty? It is the noblest
<>dynasty in the world. The familypriesthood of this
<>dynasty also is laudable. My disciple Haris4candra of
<>that royal family has recently performed the sacrifice of
<>Ra1jasu1ya. I was the Supreme priest of the function.
<>This is a covetable position not attainable to many.
<>Moreover, there is none in the world, more truthful,
<>firm of character, more charitable and more liberal than
<>Haris4candra. This is a fact.”
<NI>Vis4va1mitra got up angrily and aruged that Haris4-
<>candra was not truthful. He staked all the fruits of
<>his penance to prove this. From that day onwards Vis4va1-
<>mitra began to make moves to instigate Haris4candra to
<>deviate from the path of truth.
<NI>Once Haris4candra, while he was hunting, met a lonely
<>woman in the forest. She was moaning. The King
<>asked why she was lamenting. She replied. “Oh King.
<>I am Siddhiru1pin2i1 (a goddess who helps people to attain [Page874-a+ 65]
<>anything). Vis4va1mitra is doing penance to possess me. I
<>request you to protect me.” The King promised her to
<>see that she was not subjected to the molestation of
<>Vis4va1mitra any longer. After that Haris4candra went to
<>the hermitage of Vis4va1mitra and made an enquiry. He
<>then asked the hermit to stop penance, as his severe,
<>intense, penance was harmful to many people in the
<>country. The King returned to the palace. Vis4va1mitra
<>got angry and stood up. Up to this time only a cold war
<>existed between them. Hostility became open now.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra began to make moves against Haris4candra
<>quickly. He changed a fierce asura into a hog and sent
<>it to the garden of Haris4candra. The hog destroyed the
<>garden. All the attempts made by the guards to drive
<>the hog away ended in failure. They informed the King.
<>The King mounted on a horse and with weapons
<>started for the garden. Without paying any heed to
<>the arrows of the King, the hog ran away. The King
<>began to chase it. The hog seemed to be near. Then it
<>was away, then in front of the King and suddenly it
<>appeared behind him. Then it would disappear
<>instantly. In this manner the hog played around the
<>King. After a while, the King was separated from his
<>army and was entrapped, all alone, in a thick forest. He
<>did not find any way out. He lost his way in the forest.
<>As he was thus walking slowly, he saw a stream of pure
<>water in front of him. Both the King and the horse drank
<>from the stream. As he was standing thus without know-
<>ing the way to return home, Vis4va1mitra went to him in
<>the guise of an old Brahmin.
<NI>The King honoured the old man, and told him that he
<>was Haris4candra, the King of Ayodhya1, and that by
<>chasing a hog which destroyed his garden, he had
<>reached the forest. He continued telling the old Brahmin
<>who had helped him. “You might have heard that
<>Haris4candra, the King of Ayodhya1, had performed the
<>sacrifice Ra1jasu1ya. I am that same King. It is my vow
<>to give anybody what he asks for. If you want money
<>or anything for sacrifice or for any other purpose, just
<>come to Ayodhya1. I will give you whatever you want.”
<>The old man was pleased. He told the King that the
<>jungle-stream flowed through a holy place and that
<>it would be better to offer the gift after taking a bath
<>in the river. The King purified himself by bathing in
<>the river and then said. “Sir, I am ready to offer gifts.
<>State your needs. It is my vow to give what is requested.
<>At the time of the Ra1jasu1ya I acted so towards all of
<>you and took a vow that I would do so in future also. I
<>am glad because I have met you on the bank of this
<>holy stream. So tell me quickly what you want.”
<NI>Brahmin:--“Oh King, I have heard about your fame.
<>Moreover there is nobody in the world equal to Haris4-
<>candra, born of the Solar dynasty, the son of Tris4an3ku
<>in liberality. Such is the opinion of hermit Vasis2t2ha.
<>There is nothing more to know about you, oh, King,
<>who is such a man of liberality. I have only one desire.
<>The marriage of my son is being conducted. I do not
<>possess enough money for the marriage. I want only a
<>help for the same.” The King thought it to be a very
<>simple request, and promised to give the required
<>amount. Vis4va1mitra by illusion customary to Gandharvas
<>created a young man and a young woman, and showed
<>them to the King saying that they were his son and
<>daughter. Then the Brahmin who was delighted by the
<>promise, showed the King the way to the palace. [Page874-b+ 65]
<>After making all arrangements for the marriage, Vis4va1-
<>mitra approached King Haris4candra. The King asked
<>him what amount he required. “Give me your kingdom
<>with all the elephants, horses, chariots, jewels and
<>wealth in it”, said Vis4va1mitra. The King who had
<>been led to this deception by Vis4va1mitra, having no go,
<>agreed. Thus Vis4va1mitra obtained the kingdom and
<>everything that Haris4candra possessed. It is conven-
<>tional that whenever a gift is given to Brahmins, a
<>daks2in2a1 (monetary gift) also should be given along
<>with it. Otherwise the gift will be futile. The King
<>asked the Brahmin what he wanted as daks2in2a1. He
<>demanded two and a half Bha1ras of gold as daks2in2a1.
<>The King agreed to give that also. But where to get
<>this amount from, since he had lost his kingdom and
<>everything? Having sunk deep in misery due to the
<>deceit of Vis4va1mitra, the King sat on the soil, cursing
<>his fate. Seeing this, the queen ran to him and cried.
<>While he was telling his wife every thing, Vis4va1mitra
<>came there and said:
<NI>Vis4va1mitra:--“Hariscandra! According to the gift
<>hand over your country and everything instantly. I
<>must have the daks2in2a1 of two and a half Bha1ras of gold
<>also just now.”
<NI>Haris4candra:--“Sir! According to my promise receive
<>everything now. We are leaving the country instantly.
<>But since I have given you everything that I had, how
<>can I give you daks2in2a1? Everything I had, has become
<>yours. The amount for daks2in2a1 has yet to be procured.
<>So receive the gift now. The daks2in2a1 shall be given as
<>early as possible.”
<NI>After giving everything to the hermit, the King left the
<>country with only the cloth he had been wearing. His
<>wife and child followed him. The hermit also follow-
<>ed the King compelling him to give him the daks2in2a1.
<>The King told him that only after paying this debt
<>would he eat any food, and that he would pay the
<>amount within a month. Vis4va1mitra, unwillingly agreed
<>to this.
<NI>With his wife Candramati1 and his young son, Haris4-
<>candra reached Ka1s4i1. After a month Vis4va1mitra came
<>to Ka1s4i1 for the amount of daks2in2a1. Finding no go,
<>Candramati1 said to her husband. “My Lord! sell me to
<>some one and clear off this debt.” The King with tears
<>agreed to this proposal. Because of their woe and
<>misery, both fell on the ground and fainted. The child
<>sat near them hungry and crying. Vis4va1mitra stood near
<>them compelling them to pay the amount. When Haris4-
<>candra came to himself, he sold his beloved wife to a
<>Brahmin in the village close by. The Brahmin who
<>bought Candramati1 was Vis4va1mitra. Haris4candra was
<>not aware of this. After counting out a crore of gold
<>pieces in a cloth and placing it on the ground Vis4va1-
<>mitra caught hold of Candramati1 by her hair and
<>dragged her away. He bought the crying child also
<>paying its price. The Brahmin led the mother and the
<>child, beating and dragging them along, like animals.
<>They disappeared from the sight of the King.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra again came before Haris4candra and asked
<>for the money. Haris4candra gave Vis4va1mitra, all the
<>money he got. The hermit was not satisfied. Vis4va1mitra
<>said that the money given, was not an adequate amount
<>as daks2in2a1 when the importance of the great sacrifice
<>Ra1jasu1ya was considered and that if he was to get the
<>full benefit of the sacrifice he had to satisfy him by [Page875-a+ 65]
<>giving him the requisite amount. The King accepted
<>everything the hermit said without any objection.
<>Vis4va1mitra compelled him for payment. The King
<>requested for time. Vis4va1mitra allowed time till sunset
<>that day.
<NI>As soon as Vis4va1mitra had gone Haris4candra walked
<>on with bent head, calling out. “Does anybody want
<>me? Will anybody buy me for price?” Instantly
<>Yamadharma came there as an outcaste and bought
<>Haris4candra. The name of the outcaste was Pravi1ra.
<>He bought Haris4candra to guard the funeral ground
<>and to collect tax on dead bodies. Vis4va1mitra quickly
<>ran to the place. The outcaste gave Vis4va1mitra ten
<>yojanas of land which yielded jewels, in the region of
<>Praya1ga and severed his connection. Vis4va1mitra went
<>on his way. The outcaste King took Haris4candra to
<>the funeral ground. Day and night Haris4candra had to
<>guard the entrance of the funeral ground.
<NI>At this juncture Haris4candra's son died of snake bite,
<>while he was playing with other children on the bank
<>of the Ganges. His mother Candramati1 fainted and
<>fell down, the moment she heard about it. As soon as
<>she recovered, she lamented over the death of her son
<>for a long time. Then she requested her master for
<>permission to go and see the dead body of her son. But
<>she was not given permission. She repeatedly pleaded
<>crying all the while. Then the Brahmin, her master, got
<>angry and said. “You slave! If your son it dead, let
<>him be dead. Is it any loss to you? It is my money
<>that is lost. You go and do your work. If not I will
<>operate this whip well on you. Remember that. You
<>know the biting pain of this whip. Stop wailing and
<>lamenting.”
<NI>Candramati1 persisted in her request to allow her to go
<>and see the dead body of her son. Not only did he
<>refuse to allow her to see the dead body of her son, but
<>also beat her. With tears she turned to her duties. It
<>was night. The Brahmin took his meals and lay down
<>to sleep. Candramati1 was sitting at his feet massaging
<>his legs. When it was nearly midnight that stone-hearted
<>old Brahmin said. “Now you may go. Complete the
<>funeral and return before dawn. Your usual work in the
<>morning should not be left undone. If so, you know
<>the consequences.”
<NI>Hearing these words, Candramati1 ran to the place
<>where the dead body of her son lay. The son lay on the
<>grass dead and stiff, with the face and body turned blue
<>due to poison. She saw that face in the flash of a light-
<>ning. She cried aloud. Hearing the cry people of the
<>neighbouring houses ran to the spot. Candramati1 did
<>not give any reply to their questions Some thought her
<>to be a ghost. Some wanted to kill her. Some caught
<>her by the hair. Some struck at her. At last they tied
<>her with a rope and dragged her to the funeral place.
<>They asked Haris4candra who was standing there, to
<>cut her into pieces. He refused to kill a woman. The
<>outcaste King came there and giving Haris4candra a big
<>sword asked him again and again to cut her into pieces.
<>Candramati1 and Haris4candra did not recognize each
<>other. At last, finding it difficult to disobey his master,
<>Haris4candra raised the sword to cut her.
<NI>Then Candramati1 shouted. “You outcaste. My son is
<>lying dead on the bank of the Ganges near this town.
<>Let me bring his body and cremate it. Allow me this
<>much time. After that I will come and sit here to be [Page875-b+ 65]
<>cut into pieces by you.” Haris4candra agreed to it. Crying
<>all the way Candramati1 went to the bank of the Ganges
<>and brought the dead body of her son to the cremation
<>place. Seeing her pitiable condition Haris4candra went
<>close to the dead body and removing the shroud looked
<>at the corpse. Because of poison the body of the child
<>was blue and ugly and as Haris4candra and Candramati1
<>had undergone so thorough a change they did not
<>recognize each other. But from her lamentation and
<>talk, he understood that the woman was his wife
<>Candramati1. He also cried aloud. Candramati1 recogniz-
<>ed her husband. Still Haris4candra said that if the
<>child was cremated without collecting the usual fee, it
<>would be deceiving his master. At last both of them
<>decided to commit suicide before the night ended.
<NI>Without loss of time Haris4candra gathered half-burned
<>fire-wood, and built a pile big enough to burn the
<>child's body and for them to jump into it. He laid the
<>child on it and set fire to it. Haris4candra and Candra-
<>mati1 stood with closed eyes ready to jump into the
<>burning fire. Then Brahma1 appeared there and pre-
<>vented them from jumping into the fire. Indra and the
<>Devas showered Amr2ta (Ambrosia). The child came to
<>life and got out of the fire. The King and the queen re-
<>gained their shining bodies and royal garments and
<>ornaments. The outcaste who was the master of Haris4-
<>candra was really, Dharmadeva. All the Devas blessed
<>Haris4candra and Vis4va1mitra returned the kingdom to
<>the truthful Haris4candra. Their subjects were overjoyed
<>at the return of their King and queen. After that Rohita
<>was anointed as the King of Ayodhya1 and the Devas
<>went with Haris4candra to heaven. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 7).

<NI>8) {%Cursing Rambha1.%} Once Vis4va1mitra was doing very
<>severe penance. Indra feared him. So wishing to hinder
<>the penance of Vis4va1mitra somehow Indra called
<>Rambha1 to him and said to her. “Rambha1, you dress
<>well and dance before Vis4va1mitra. Somehow his pen-
<>ance must be hindered. I shall take the form of a
<>cuckoo, and help you by singing.”
<NI>Indra and Rambha1 reached the forest of penance. The
<>cuckoo began to sing and there was the atmosphere of
<>spring season. Rambha1 danced before Vis4va1mitra. The
<>concentration of the hermit was broken. The hermit got
<>angry and cursed Rambha1 and changed her into a rock.
<>She entreated for redemption from the curse. The her-
<>mit told her that after ten thousand years a Brahmin
<>named Bhu1ritejas would touch the rock, by which touch
<>she would get her original form. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 64).

<NI>11) {%Cursing Vidyutprabha1.%} Once Vis4va1mitra did penance
<>to obtain the position of Kubera, who employed the
<>celestial maid Vidyutprabha1 to obstruct the penance of
<>Vis4va1mitra. She came to the forest in which Vis4va1mitra
<>was doing penance and tried to entice the hermit by
<>her beauty. But when she saw that her beauty did not
<>attract the hermit, she assumed a fearful form. Seeing [Page876-a+ 63]
<>this form, the hermit cursed her. “You shall retain this
<>fearful form and live like a giantess.” She requested for
<>redemption. The hermit said that when S4ri1datta, the
<>son of Ka1lanemi, touched her hair she would be re-
<>deemed from the curse.
<NI>After many years Ka1lanemi was born in the country of
<>Ma1lava as the son of a brahmin named Yajn5asena. A
<>son named S4ri1datta was born to this Ka1lanemi. Once
<>S4ri1datta happened to see this giantess in a forest and
<>caught hold of her by the hair. Instantly she got her
<>original form. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka,
<>Taran3ga 2).
<NI>12) {%Stealing the flesh of a dog.%} Once, at the end of
<>Treta1 Yuga and the beginning of Dva1para Yuga,
<>there was no rain for twelve years. Famine prevailed
<>every-where. The people were in utter want and misery.
<>Hermits left their hermitages and wandered about. In
<>a crowd Vis4va1mitra lost his wife and children and
<>entered a forest and travelled all alone. He entered the
<>hut of a low-caste (Paraya) and begged for food. But
<>none of them even talked to him. He again requested
<>for something to eat. Nobody cared for him. The her-
<>mit fell on the veranda due to weakness.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra saw in the hut some decayed flesh and intes-
<>tine of a dog placed in a corner of the kitchen. He de-
<>cided to steal some of it to appease his hunger. The
<>Can2d2a1las slept when the night advanced. But the lord
<>of the house lay pretending to sleep. Vis4va1mitra slowly
<>entered the kitchen, and opened the pot in which the
<>intestine of the dog was kept. The owner of the house
<>asked, “Who is that?” Vis4va1mitra replied that he had
<>stolen because of his hunger. The eyes of the can2d2a1la
<>were filled with tears because of pity. He said:
<Poem>“Dog is lower than jackal,
<>That is what men say,
<>Of all the parts of its body,
<>the lowest is its posterior.”</Poem>
<NI>Though he said so, he felt glad since he had given
<>Vis4va1mitra food. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 141).

<>given in Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana Parva.
<NI>15). {%Vis4va1mitra and R2gveda.%} R2gveda, Man2dala 5, was
<>composed by the Vis4va1mitra-family. Variations are
<>observed in the two versions of statements about Vis4va1-
<>mitra, occurring in R2gveda and the Pura1n2as. The con-
<>frontations between Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra occur in
<>R2gveda also. The last four sections of Su1kta 15 of
<>R2gveda, Man2d2ala 3, Anuva1ka 4, are meant to scold
<>Vasis2t2ha. Here Vis4va1mitra curses Vasis2t2ha's family in
<>various ways. In the ‘Annotations of Sa1yan2a’, mention
<>is made that the disciples of Vasis2t2ha freed Vis4va1mitra
<>from the vow of silence, and that instantly these mantras
<>(chants) dawned in his mind. Though the enmity bet-
<>ween Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra is seen in R2gveda, such
<>elaborate stories as seen in the Pura1n2as do not occur in
<>R2gveda. But Vis4va1mitra procured a prominent place in
<>R2gveda because this hermit rescued Suda1sa from danger
<>and forded him across rivers, and took S4unas4s4epha as
<>his son. Of these two incidents the first is not given
<>much importance in the Pura1n2as. Though the second
<>one occurs in the Pura1n2as, the version is different from [Page876-b+ 64]
<>that of R2gveda. From this it is presumed that the stories
<>taken from R2gveda underwent a thorough change before
<>they appeared in the Pura1n2as.

<>devastation will become rampant on earth. (M.B, S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 328).
<HI>VIVA1HA (MARRIAGE).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} In ancient India marriage was
<>considered to be a sacrifice performed in accordance with
<>social customs. Marriage was allowed to those who had
<>completed education at the age of sixteen. (Sama1var-
<>tana). Father or teacher teaches the pupil the Vedas
<>and Veda1n3gas. When the education is completed the
<>teacher or father makes him sit on a seat decorated
<>with flowers, sandalwood etc. and do Goda1navrata. Then
<>he is offered Pan5ca1mr2ta (milk, curd, butter, honey and
<>water). This is called Sama1vartana. With this his
<>brahmacarya ends, and he is allowed to marry and
<>lead the life of a house-holder.
<NI>Marriage is a ceremony with four secondary rites Viz,
<>Kanya1da1na, S4aci1ya1ga, Viva1ha, Caturthi1karman. If the
<>husband is dead, or lost, or has renounced the world,
<>or has become a eunuch or is expelled from society, the
<>woman is allowed to take another husband. If the
<>husband dies, the wife should be given to the brother
<>of the husband. If there is no brother she could accept
<>anybody whom she likes.
<NI>2) {%Eight kinds of marriages.%} The woman and man
<>should not be of the same Gotra (family). One could
<>marry a girl who is above seven generations on the
<>paternal line and above five generations on the mater-
<>nal line. Eight types of marriages allowed in Manu-
<>smr2ti, Chapter 3, are given below:
<NI>(i) {%Bra1hma.%} A man of good qualities and good family
<>is asked to come and receive the damsel. This is
<>Bra1hma. The radiance of this marriage will give the
<>man prosperity.
<NI>(ii) {%A1rs2a.%} After getting a couple of cows from the
<>bridegroom the bride is given to him.
<NI>(iii) {%Pra1ja1patya.%} The virgin is given to the man, who
<>had requested for her hand as a duty.
<NI>(iv) {%Daiva.%} The virgin is offered to the master who is
<>engaged in performing a sacrifice.
<NI>(v) {%Ga1ndharva.%} Marriage between a man and a woman
<>with equal love on either part.
<NI>(vi) {%A1sura.%} Giving money in return for the damsel
<>and marrying her. This type is mean.
<NI>(vii) {%Ra1ks2asa.%} Carrying the damsel away by fight or
<>force.
<NI>(viii) {%Pais4a1ca.%} Marrying a damsel when she is sleeping
<>or lying unconscious.
<HI>VIVARDHANA. A King in ancient India. Mention is
<>made in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza
<>21, that this King was a prominent member of the
<>assembly of Yudhis2t2hira. [Page879-a+ 65]
<HI>VIVASVA1N I. The Sun.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Su1rya (Sun) has a large number
<>of synonyms. But prominence is given to two of them,
<>Ma1rtan2d2a and Vivasva1n in the Pura1n2as. Twelve devas
<>were born to Praja1pati Kas4yapa by his wife Aditi. As
<>these twelve were the sons of Aditi they were called
<>A1dityas. The Dva1das4a1dityas (the twelve A1dityas) are
<>Vis2n2u, S4akra, Aryaman, Dha1ta1, Tvas2t2a1, Pu1s2a1 Vivasva1n,
<>Savita1, Mitra, Varun2a, Am3s4u and Bhaga. These twelve
<>A1dityas were, in the previous Manvantara (Age of
<>Manu) of Manu Ca1ks2us2a, twelve Devas called the
<>Tus2itas. When the Ca1ks2us2a Manvantara came to an
<>end and the Vaivasvata Manvantara was about to
<>begin, the twelve Tus2itas met together and after a con-
<>sultation, they took birth as the sons of Aditi. In this
<>birth they were known by the name Dva1das4a1dityas.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>2) {%The name Ma1rtan2d2a.%} As Aditi was pregnant, Candra
<>went to the hermitage asking for alms. Due to her diffi-
<>culties of pregnancy Aditi was not in a position to rise
<>up instantly and greet the visitor. Candra thought that
<>it was due to disrespect. So he cursed her. Let the
<>child in your womb die.” At this Aditi became misera-
<>ble. Kas4yapa saw her crying incessantly and asked for
<>the cause. Aditi told him all that had happened.
<>Kas4yapa blessed her and said that the infant would not
<>die. Thus the child which was lying dead in the womb
<>came to life again. As the ‘an2d2a’ (egg-embryo) of
<>Vivasva1n went mr2ta (died) by the curse of Candra, he
<>came to be called Ma1rtan2d2a (he who has an2d2a which
<>has become mr2ta). When the child was born he was
<>given the name Vivasva1n.
<NI>3) {%Family life.%} Vivasva1n married Sam3jn5a1, the daughter
<>of Vis4vakarma1. The first child born to Vivasva1n by
<>Sam3jn5a1 was Vaivasvata Manu. The Su1rya (Solar)
<>dynasty begins from this Vaivasvata Manu. Sam3jn5a1
<>again gave birth to two children Yama and Yami1. Then
<>finding it difficult to bear the fierce brightness of the
<>sun Sam3jn5a1 gave her place to her maid Cha1ya1 otherwise
<>called Savarn2a1, and went to the house of her father.
<>Vis4vakarma1 did not like this action on the part of his
<>daughter. So Sam3jn5a1 took the form of a mare and went
<>to the pastures of North Kuru. Thinking Cha1ya1 to be
<>his wife Sam3jn5a1, Vivasva1n went to bed with her. She
<>conceived and gave birth to two sons and a daughter.
<>The sons were named Sa1varn2i and S4ani and the daughter
<>was named Tapati1. Cha1ya1 loved her own children more.
<>The children of Sam3jn5a1 were grieved at this. Yama once
<>lifted his leg to kick her. “Let that leg be broken.”
<>Cha1ya1 cursed him. The miserable Yama ran to his
<>father and said. “Father, this mother hates us and loves
<>Sa1varn2i and S4ani more. It is true that I lifted up my
<>leg. But my leg did not touch mother's head. Father, I
<>request you to pardon the wrong I have done because of
<>my ignorance. Have pity on me and tell me how to save
<>my leg from breaking.” Vivasva1n said to Yama that his
<>leg would not be broken, but because of the curse worms
<>would bite his leg. Vivasva1n understood that Cha1ya1
<>was not the real mother. He went to Vis4vakarma1.
<>Vis4vakarma1 put Vivasva1n on his turning machine and
<>by turning lessened his brightness. Vivasva1n who was
<>made more handsome by turning, found out his wife
<>Sam3jn5a1, and approached her. But thinking him to be
<>somebody else she moved away from him. In the mean-
<>while two male persons were born from the nostrils of [Page879-b+ 64]
<>Sam3jn5a1. There is another story that these two persons
<>were the As4vinidevas. Vivasva1n and Sam3jn5a1 came home.
<>As a retribution for the wrong he had done, Yama
<>ruled over his subjects justly and earned the name
<>Dharmara1ja. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 21; Bhavis2ya
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 47; Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>171).

<>said “Oh! Asura! What S4iva said was a lie. He has no
<>divine power now. He was making fun of you. Not an
<>ant would die by the touch of your fingers. You just try
<>on your head and see for yourself.” Hearing this the
<>asura became dejected. He thought what the boy said
<>was true. The poor creature touched his own head with
<>his finger. The moment he touched his head, he fell

<>yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 14, Stanza 29, as follows
<>about the origin of Vr2ks2as (trees).
<NI>Praja1pati Kas4yapa married Anala1, the daughter of
<>Daks2a. Trees yielding good fruits were given birth to by

<HI>VR2KS2APRATIS2T2HA1. The ancient Indians believed
<>that consecration of Trees and gardens (parks) were
<>means of remission of sins and attainment of heaven. As
<>the consecration of trees is a divine ritual it has to be
<>performed as ordained in the Vedas. The rites are given
<>below:
<NI>As the first item of the consecration ceremony of a tree,
<>besmear it with all kinds of medicinal herbs, and adorn
<>it with flour and flowergarlands and make it wear good
<>clothes. Then make on it perforations for the ears with
<>golden needle, and anoint ointment for eyes with golden
<>wire. Place on the dais prepared at the foot of each
<>tree, seven fruits and pots (Kalas4as) and make invoca-
<>tions. After this, offerings and sacrifices to Indra and
<>the other gods should be given. Again invocation
<>should be made with burnt offerings to Vanaspati. From
<>the middle of the trees alms of cows should be given.
<>Brahmins should bathe the trees with pots placed on the
<>dais, reciting spells and incantations of anointment, and
<>of R2g, Yajur and Sa1ma Vedas along with instrumental
<>music. The owner of the trees should be given bathing
<>water by himself. Then the owner should give cows,
<>lands, ornaments and clothes as gift.
<NI>After having done so much, food with milk should be
<>given for four days and burnt offerings should be made
<>with gingelly etc. and butea. The gift to the priest
<>should be double the gifts given to others. (Agni Pura1n2a
<>Chapter 70).
<HI>VR2KS2AVA1SI1. A Yaks2a. Mention is made in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 10, Stanza 11, that this
<>Yaks2a lives in the palace of Kubera.
<HI>VR2KS2A1YURVEDA. The name Vr2ks2a1yurveda is used for
<>the conventional rules about planting trees near dwel-
<>ling places. According to Vr2ks2a1yurveda it is good to
<>plant Itti (wave-leafed fig-tree) on the North side of
<>the house. Ficus Indica (banyan) should be plantd on
<>the east. Mango tree on the south and Ficus Religiosa
<>(banyan) on the west of the house. Thorny trees should
<>grow up by themselves on the south side of the house.
<>Garden should be close to the house. Sva1ti1, Hasta,
<>Rohin2i1, S4ravan2a and Mu1la are considered to be good
<>stars for planting trees. Stars good for taking trees,
<>across river or in vehicle and to take down into ponds,
<>are Hasta, Magha1, A1rdra1, As4vini1, Pus2yam and Jyes2t2ha1.
<>The stars mentioned above are good for planting Neem
<>tree, Jonesia Asoca, Calophyllum, Mimosasirisha, Acacia
<>Priyan3gu, Syzygium, Mimusops and pomegranate tree.
<>The distance between trees should be twenty rods. This
<>distance is the best. Sixteen rods is medium. But it
<>should never be less than twelve rods. If the tree does
<>not bear fruit, the stem should be examined by cutting
<>with a knife. Then mix powdered vermifuge seeds with
<>ghee and smear it on the cut. Then water the tree. If
<>fruits are destroyed before they ripen, mix the powders [Page881-b+ 64]
<>of horse-gram, black-gram, green-gram, barley and se-
<>sam with ghee and smear the tree and water it. Water-
<>ing the tree with water and ghee will make the tree
<>flower and yield fruits quickly. Mix powdered dung of
<>sheep, powdered Barley, sesam, and cow's flesh with
<>water and keep it for seven days. Then water the tree
<>with this water. This will make any tree yield more fruits
<>and flowers. Watering the trees with fish-water will
<>make them yield fruits more quickly. Mixture of Vermi-
<>fuge seed, fish and rice is a good manure. This manure
<>is a good remedy for all diseases of trees. (Agni Pura1n2a
<>Chapter 281).

<>and churned the sea of milk, ever so many noble objects
<>rose up to the surface of the sea. Several beautiful
<>damsels also came up. Vis2n2u grew amorous of them
<>and thus thousands of sons were born by them. These sons
<>who were born in the Pa1ta1la (Nether world), by and by,
<>came up and began to do harm to the dwellers of the
<>earth. At this time S4iva took the incarnation in the
<>form of an ox to study the situation properly. In this
<>disguise S4iva entered Pa1ta1la and took by stealth the
<>Sudars4ana (the weapon of Vis2n2u) and drove him to
<>heaven. When Vis2n2u had gone from Pa1ta1la, he had
<>advised his sons to stay in Pa1ta1la. Vr2s2a who came to
<>know of this, cursed them:--“Any man, other than the
<>peaceful hermits and Da1navas (asuras) who are born

<>At this time Vr2s2a1darbhi had been performing a sacri-
<>fice. Vr2s2a1darbhi invoked the seven hermits and gave them
<>his son as a gift. The child died before long. As famine
<>was prevailing everywhere the hermits were weak and [Page882-b+ 64]
<>worn out by hunger. They wished to eat the flesh of
<>the child. Vr2s2a1darbhi tried to dissuade the hermits
<>from this beastly action in vain. At last the angry King
<>created a wicked fairy to kill the hermits. Though the
<>fairy attacked the hermits, Indra, who had lived with
<>the seven hermits killed the fairy.

<>stolen by Kr2s2n2a himself, Vr2s2n2i took a hostile mentality
<>towards Kr2s2n2a. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, 3: 71: 1).

<>Five sons were born to him by Ma1dri1. (Va1yu: 94:
<>14; Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 211; 1-2; 5: 8).
<HI>VR2TRA (VR2TRA1SURA). A mighty and fierce asura.
<NI>1) {%Reason for his birth.%} Vr2tra was the rebirth of emperor
<>Citraketu. Citraketu and his wife Kr2tadyuti prayed to
<>An3giras, as a result of which a son was born to them.
<>That son died in his infancy. But An3giras brought him
<>to life again. Brahma1 and Na1rada taught Citraketu
<>theosophy. Citraketu sat in contemplation for eight
<>days and changing himself to a Gandharva he flew
<>through the sky. As he was flying, he saw Pa1rvati1 sitting
<>on the thigh of S4iva and laughed aloud. Knowing this
<>Pa1rvati1 cursed him to become an asura. Vr2tra1sura was
<>the rebirth of the emperor according to this curse.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 6).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Two stories are mentioned about the birth of
<>Vr2tra1sura. One story is that Kas4yapa created him from
<>fire. The other story is that Vr2tra was the son of Tvas2t2a1.
<>Both are given below:
<NI>(i) Hiran2yakas4ipu was born to Praja1pati Kas4yapa, by
<>his wife Danu. Maha1vis2n2u killed him on being request-
<>ed by the Devas. Danu was grieved at the death of her
<>son. So Kas4yapa gave her another son. He was Vala or
<>Bala. Indra killed him with his weapon, the thunder-
<>bolt. Kas4yapa got angry and plucking a hair from his
<>matted hair, made a burnt offering of it, saying “Let a
<>son who would be the killer of Indra be born.” Imme-
<>diately a huge giant, as black as antimony with yellow
<>eyes was born from the fire. That asura, clad in the
<>hide of antelope with sword in hand, opening his mouth,
<>from which two huge tusks protruded, very wide, and
<>shining with radiance cried out in a voice of thunder,
<>“Oh! Sage! Order me, what am I to do?”
<NI>Kas4yapa ordered him to kill Indra. He named the
<>monster Vr2tra. (Padma Pura1n2a, Bhu1mi Khan2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 23).
<NI>(ii) It was Praja1pati Tvas2t2a1 who created Vr2tra to kill
<>Indra. He had sufficient reasons for it. From the very
<>beginning Indra and Tvas2t2a1 were enemies. Tvas2t2a1 be-
<>got a son named Tris4iras otherwise called Vis4varu1pa,
<>for the purpose of killing Indra. This Vis4varu1pa had
<>three heads. One was meant for drinking Sura1 (a
<>liquor), the second for drinking Soma (liquor) and the
<>third for eating food. Vis4varu1pa was a Bra1hman2a. Still,
<>as his mother was an asura, he loved the asuras and
<>mingled with them. Indra knew about the behaviour
<>of Vis4varu1pa. He concluded that it was blasphemy and
<>wickedness. Indra who was afraid of Vis4varu1pa, got
<>angry and cut off his heads. Of the heads of Vis4varu1pa,
<>that which drank Soma became a bird called Kapin5-
<>jala, that which drank Sura1 became a bird called
<>Kalapin3ga, and that which ate food became the
<>bird Tittiri (partridge). Brahmahatya1 (the sin of kill-
<>ing Brahmin) took shape and went against Indra.
<>Though Indra could have destroyed it, he joined his [Page884-a+ 65]
<>hands and received it. At the end of the year he cut it
<>into four pieces and divided them among earth, water,
<>tree and woman. The earth received it with the boon
<>that depressions will be filled. That sin is now seen as
<>salt beds. Water got it with the boon, “Will be swollen
<>when joined”. That sin is foam and bubbles. The tree
<>got it with the boon, “Will not die even if cut into
<>pieces”. That sin is the sap of the tree. Women got it with
<>the boon, “Amour will last without break”. That sin is
<>the menstruation of women.
<NI>When Tvas2t2a1 heard that his righteous son was killed
<>by Indra unreasonably, he became angry and began to
<>make burnt offerings with spells and incantations of
<>Atharvaveda. This offering continued for eight days.
<>On the eighth day at night, an extremely bright male
<>person arose from the fire pit. He rose higher and higher
<>as the flame of fire. Then that figure of power asked
<>Tvas2t2a1. “Father! what is my name? What have I to
<>do for you? What is the reason for your grief?” He
<>said that he was prepared to drink up the ocean dry or
<>smash the mountains, or prevent the sun and the moon
<>from moving or any such thing for the sake of his father.
<>The father ordered him to kill Indra. From that day
<>onwards Vr2tra got ready to kill Indra. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 6).
<NI>3) {%The slaughter of Vr2tra1sura.%} Hearing about the pro-
<>wess, strength, and the martial radiance of Vr2tra1sura,
<>Indra grew afraid of him and began to think about
<>means and ways to kill him. Indra called the Saptars2is
<>(seven hermits) and sent them to Vr2tra. His intention
<>was to make a treaty. The seven hermits approached
<>Vr2tra and requested him to make a treaty with Indra,
<>and told him that Indra was prepared to give half of
<>the position of Indra.
<NI>Vr2tra:--Look hermits! If Indra honestly desires to be
<>in peace with me, I have no objection. But what is the
<>surety that Indra will not deceive me?
<NI>Hermits:--If Indra proves to be false and deliberately
<>deceives you, he has agreed to bear the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1 incurred, by himself.
<NI>Vr2tra agreed to make a treaty on this condition. The
<>hermits took Vr2tra to the palace of Indra. Seeing Vr2tra1-
<>sura who was coming to be friends with him Indra rose
<>from his royal chair and offered half of it to Vr2tra.
<>Both embraced each other and vowed that they would
<>be brothers born from the same womb.
<NI>Thus having engaged Vr2tra in a treaty deceitfully,
<>Indra waited for an opportunity to kill Vr2tra. Once
<>Indra sent Rambha1 to infatuate Vr2tra. “Look, beauti-
<>ful girl! Make Vr2tra senseless somehow so that I may
<>kill him.” Hearing this, with a beautiful laugh, Rambha1
<>went with her maids to the Park Nandana and waited
<>for Vr2tra1sura. At this time Vr2tra, with some Da1nava
<>friends, came to the park Nandana for entertainment.
<>Indra walked beside watching for the opportunity to
<>kill him. Without fearing any danger from Indra, Vr2tra
<>walked through the park, seeing the celestial maids
<>singing and dancing and playing various games in the
<>garden, and they reached a corner where Rambha1 had
<>been singing sweet songs and swinging with her maids.
<>This sight made Vr2tra amorous. He approached
<>Rambha1 and prayed to her to become his wife. Under
<>that sandalwood tree Rambha1 asked him. “Oh hand-
<>some youth! I am Rambha1. I came here with my
<>maids to play. Who are you, my Lord?” [Page884-b+ 64]
<>Vr2tra: “Beautiful maid! I am the son of Kas4yapa
<>and the friend of Indra. I enjoy half the position of
<>Indra. I, Vr2tra, have brought the three worlds under
<>my control. I shall be complete in all aspects, if I
<>could marry you.”
<NI>Rambha1 agreed to the marriage on condition that
<>Vr2tra would not gainsay her in anything. They engaged
<>in amorous plays and Rambha1 made the Brahmin
<>drink liquor in large quantities and he became uncons-
<>cious. Indra took this opportunity and sent his thunder-
<>bolt which took away the life of Vr2tra. Instantly Indra
<>became affected with sins such as Brahmahatya1 etc.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapters 23 and 24).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Indra washed away the sin of Brahmahatya1 incur-
<>red by killing Vr2tra, at the place called Karu1s2a. (See
<>under An3gamalada).
<NI>(ii) It was at the time of the killing of Vr2tra by Indra,
<>that Jat2a1yu and Sampa1ti made bets and flew up to the
<>region of the Sun. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1
<>Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 58, Stanza 4).

<>Vr2tra1sura occurs in various places in the R2gveda.
<>R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 16, Su1kta 80 refers to

<>Chapter 9, Stanza 48, that Vr2tra1sura was born from
<>the fire of Sorcery and witchcraft of Tvas2t2a1.
<NI>(viii) In the fight between Indra and Vr2tra, Indra was
<>swallowed by Vr2tra. But Indra contracted the members
<>of his body and became smaller and smaller and came
<>out of Vr2tra's belly. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 9,
<>Stanza 52).
<NI>(ix) Once the teacher-priest S4ukra asked Vr2tra certain
<>questions to all of which Vr2tra gave proper answers.

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order: Brahma1-Vasis2t2ha-S4akti-Para1s4ara-Vya1sa.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Vya1sa was born to hermit Para1s4ara by a fisher-
<>woman named Ka1li1. His name when he was a child
<>was Kr2s2n2a. As his birth took place in an island (Dvi1pa)
<>he got the name Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana. After dividing the
<>Vedas he got the name Vedavya1sa. He is the composer
<>of Maha1bha1rata, one of the greatest books in world-
<>literature. The births of great men, generally will be
<>wonderful. Behind the birth of Vya1sa also there is a
<>wonderful story.
<NI>As has already been mentioned, Ka1li1, a fisherwoman
<>was the mother of Vya1sa. There is a story about this
<>Ka1li1 also. When king Vasu of Cedi went to the forest
<>for hunting, he saw the coition of animals and he had
<>seminal discharge. The king sent that semen to his
<>queen. But on the way it fell in the river Ka1lindi1 and
<>was eaten by a fish. This fish was a celestial maid
<>named Adrika1 transformed to fish by a curse. The fish
<>conceived and got into the net of a fisherman, who lived
<>on the banks of Ka1lindi1. When this fish was cut open
<>a male and a female infant were seen inside. The male
<>child was given to the king himself. The fisherman
<>brought up the girl naming her Ka1li1. As the girl had
<>the gandha (smell) of matsya (fish), she got the name
<>‘Matsya-gandha1’, also. This fisherman was also a ferry-
<>man. Ka1li1 used to help her father in ferrying people
<>across the river Ka1lindi1. She grew up and became a
<>young woman.
<NI>Once the hermit Parasara came by that way to go to
<>the other side of the river. At that time, the fisherman
<>who has been taking people across the river, was sitting
<>on the bank of the river and having his meals. As soon
<>as Para1s4ara came, the innocent fisherman--the foster-
<>father of Matsyagandha1--called her, who was standing
<>close by and asked her to take the hermit across the [Page885-b+ 65]
<>river. The hermit got into the boat. Matsyagandha1
<>began to row the boat. The beauty of the damsel sitting
<>in front of him and the little waves of the river, com-
<>bined together had the effect of arousing passion in the
<>hermit. He became sexually excited and sat close to her.
<>Discerning his intention she moved away from him and
<>prayed to him humbly not to violate her chastity. She
<>repeated her prayer. The hermit Para1s4ara created an
<>artificial fog around the boat. The smell of fish was
<>gone from her and the fragrance of Musk took its place.
<>The hermit created an artificial island in the middle of
<>the river. They got down on the island and acted a love
<>drama. She became pregnant. Para1s4ara said to her.
<>“Beautiful girl! Even after your confinement you shall
<>remain a virgin. A son, who will be a portion of Vis2n2u,
<>a man of purity, famous throughout the three worlds,
<>highly learned, the teacher-priest of the whole world,
<>shall be born to you. He will divide the Vedas and will
<>be exalted by the people of the world.”
<NI>After this the great hermit took his bath in Yamuna1 and
<>went away. The pregnancy of Ka1li1 was completed in-
<>stantly and she gave birth to a very handsome boy in
<>that island of Yamuna1. As soon as he was born, he grew
<>up and became a hermit radiant with devotion and as-
<>suming a vow of purity and abstinence he said to his
<>mother. “Mother! You can go anywhere, as you please.
<>You need have no worry on my account. I am about to
<>go for penance. When anything unpleasant happens to
<>you, just think of me. The moment you wish to see me,
<>I will be there by you. I wish you a happy life. I am
<>going.” Saying thus the brave boy walked away. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 2; Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapters 60 to 63).
<NI>3) {%Spiritual life.%}
<NI>{%i) Introduction.%} Two sides, the spiritual as well as the
<>material, are seen in the life of Vya1sa. It was after the
<>marriage of S4antanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, with
<>his mother Ka1li1, otherwise known as Satyavati1, that
<>Vya1sa came into contact with Hastina1pura. Participating
<>in all the vicissitudes of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas
<>was the worldly side of the life of Vya1sa. But the major
<>part of his life was spent in living as a hermit in his
<>hermitage in the forest with a large group of disciples;
<>teaching them the Vedas. A small description of that
<>spiritual life is given below:
<NI>ii) {%In the forest.%} We do not see Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana, who
<>had grown up to a youth at the time of his birth, for
<>many years after his departure, bidding adieu to his
<>mother. He might have been living with hermits in the
<>forests, learning Vedas from them. After this he appears
<>on the banks of river Sarasvati1 as a teacher and Priest.
<>As he was doing penance there, he saw two sparrows,
<>legs and beaks red, without even down feathers, crying
<>for food, and the parent birds, with the utmost care and
<>tenderness feeding them. They flew about here and there
<>and gathered food and came back quickly. Because of
<>joy at the sight of their parents, the little ones opened
<>their ruby-red mouths with cries and throbbing. They
<>kissed the young ones and fed them. The young spar-
<>rows hid under the wings of their father and mother
<>and enjoyed the surroundings by thrusting out their
<>heads and looking on all sides.
<NI>{%iii) Birth of son.%} Seeing this, the paternity instinct in
<>him was aroused. He understood that love of children
<>was merely for the sake of love, that this love was pure [Page886-a+ 65]
<>and simple. Moreover there is the maxim that a man
<>without a son has no right to aspire for heaven. Sad
<>and silent, thinking of these things he walked on unwill-
<>ingly and reached the vicinity of the Hima1layas. Still,
<>he was doubtful. He began to consider about the deity,
<>before whom he had to do penance for the fulfilment of
<>his wish. He could not decide. As he was sitting in
<>thought, Na1rada came there. From the talk of Vya1sa,
<>Na1rada knew that childlessness was the cause of his
<>sorrow. Na1rada advised him that for the attainment of
<>Purus2a1rthas (objects of life) penance was to be done
<>before Devi1. Accepting that advice, Vya1sa went to a
<>place near Maha1meru to do penance.
<NI>When Vya1sa began penance, the celestial maids also
<>commenced their work of hindering the penance. It was
<>Ghr2ta1ci1 who confronted Vya1sa. She took the form of a
<>parrot of five colours and flew in front of Vya1sa. The
<>hermit was excited at the beauty of Ghr2ta1ci1 and sat
<>forgetting himself. As he sat there thinking of the infat-
<>uating beauty of the parrot, seminal discharge occurred
<>to him. He became a slave to this infatuation, when he
<>was engaged in making fire by attrition. In this
<>amorous state of mind he was quite unaware of the
<>seminal discharge or its falling on the pieces of wood
<>used for attrition. He continued attrition. Then a very
<>bright, divine person appeared from the pieces of wood.
<>At the birth of a person, without attachment to a womb,
<>all the worlds were delighted. The hide of black ante-
<>lope, water pot, hermit's rod etc. fell from the sky.
<>Birth rituals and ceremonies, according to the custom,
<>were conducted by Vya1sa. As he was born from the
<>semen discharged at the sight of the S4uka (parrot) the
<>infant was named S4uka. As soon as he was born S4uka
<>began to grow by divine power and shortly became a
<>boy of shining radiance. After investiture with the
<>Brahma-string, the boy was sent for education to the
<>hermitage of Br2haspati, the teacher of the devas. S4uka
<>completed his education with Br2haspati and having
<>performed Sama1varta and offering of gift to the teacher,
<>he returned home to his father.
<NI>{%iv) Disciples.%} S4uka commenced advanced study under
<>his father Vya1sa. Besides S4uka, Vya1sa had disciples such
<>as Vais4ampa1yana, Su1ta, Paila, Jaimini and others also,
<>living with him. The hermitage of Vya1sa soon grew up
<>to be a great educational institution, with plenty of dis-
<>ciples.
<NI>{%v) Separation of son.%} In the meanwhile S4uka married and
<>lived the life of a householder in the hermitage of his
<>father, for a time. Then forsaking his family and his
<>father, S4uka went to the peak of Kaila1sa and began to
<>do penance meditating on S4iva. At last he became a
<>divine person who had obtained complete attainments,
<>and breaking the top of the peak open, he rose up into
<>the sky and shone there as a second Sun. The devas who
<>saw S4uka rising up by breaking the peak of Kaila1sa and
<>staying up in the sky, praised him.
<NI>This untimely separation of his son had undermined the
<>firmness of the mind of Vya1sa. Filled with grief, he left
<>his hermitage and wandered here and there calling out
<>his son by name. He could not find his son. At last he
<>reached the peak of Kaila1sa where his son had been
<>doing penance. Standing there he called aloud his son
<>by name cryingly. Paramas4iva appeared before the
<>lamenting father and consoled him. Thus getting a little
<>bit of peace of mind, Vya1sa returned to his hermitage [Page886-b+ 64]
<>and lived there. The sorrowing Vya1sa, was made still
<>more sorrowful by the departure of his beloved disciples,
<>Asita, Devala, Vais4ampa1yana, Sumantu, Jaimini and
<>others who had been living in the hermitage and who
<>had departed, having finished their education. All the
<>surroundings of the hermitage seemed to him filled
<>with pain. At last he thought about his mother.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata Skandha 1).
<NI>4) {%His terrestrial life.%}
<NI>{%i) Preface.%} Within this period many changes had
<>taken place in Hastina1pura and the bank of Yamuna1.
<>S4antanu the king of the Lunar dynasty had married
<>Gan3ga1devi1, who had disappeared after giving the king
<>a son named Devavrata (Bhi1s2ma). Bhi1s2ma grew up.
<>Once S4antanu was hunting in the forest when he was
<>attracted by the sweet smell of musk. Tracing the
<>origin of that smell, the king reached the fisherman's
<>hut on the banks of the Yamuna1. That smell proceeded
<>from Kastu1rigandha1 (Satyavati1) the mother of Vya1sa.
<>The king fell in love with her. He returned to the
<>palace, sad and silent. Learning the cause of his father's
<>sadness, Devavrata went to the fisherman's hut and took
<>S4atyavati1 to the palace to be given to his father. Deva-
<>vrata had taken a vow that the kingdom would be given
<>to the son born to Satyavati1 and that he would remain
<>unmarried, throughout his life. Because he had taken
<>so terrible a vow, Devavrata came to be called Bhi1s2ma
<>from that day onwards.
<NI>Two sons named Citra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya, were
<>born to S4antanu. Citra1n3gada died when he was young.
<>Vicitravi1rya married Ambika1 and Amba1lika1, daughters
<>of the King of Ka1s4i1. Vicitravi1rya also died before any
<>children were born to him. It seemed as if the family
<>was about to become extinct. At this juncture Satyavati1
<>thought about her son Vya1sa.
<NI>ii) {%Vya1sa in Hastina1puri1.%} The mother thought about
<>him, and instantly he reached Hastina1puri1. Because of
<>her compulsion, two sons were born, one each to Ambi-
<>ka1 and Amba1lika1 from Vya1sa. The son of Ambika1 was
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the son of Amba1lika1 was Pa1n2d2u. Vid-
<>ura was the son born to Vya1sa by their maid.
<NI>iii) {%Vya1sa and the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2avas.%} From this time
<>onwards we see Vya1sa as the spiritual teacher of the
<>Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas. Behind all the movements
<>of these two families we could see the hand of Vya1sa.
<>Thus though he came to Hastina1puri1 and gave advice
<>to the members of the family frequently, his main abode
<>was his hermitage. Vya1sa's contact with Hastina1pura
<>could be seen up to the Maha1prastha1na (the great
<>departure) of the Pa1n2d2avas. In all the administrative
<>affairs up to this period, Vya1sa also had a part. The
<>situations in which Vya1sa had taken part in the life-
<>voyage of the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas are given
<>below.
<NI>(i) Vya1sa gave the boon that hundred sons would be
<>born to Ga1ndha1ri1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 114,
<>Stanza 8).
<NI>(ii) Vya1sa cut the mass of flesh given birth to by
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 into a hundred pieces and kept them in
<>hundred pots. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 114, Stanza
<>17).
<NI>(iii) Vya1sa consoled Ga1ndha1ri1 by telling her that over
<>and above hundred sons a daughter also would be born
<>to her. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 115, Stanza 16). [Page887-a+ 64]
<NI>(iv) Vya1sa consoled the Pa1n2d2avas who had been
<>living in the forest with their mother Kunti1, after the
<>death of Pa1n2d2u their father. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 155, Verse 5).
<NI>(v) On another occasion Vya1sa came to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and told them the stories of the previous births of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 168).
<NI>(vi) Vya1sa rendered all possible help to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>to marry Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 195).
<NI>(vii) Very often Vya1sa was a member of the council
<>of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4,
<>Stanza 11).
<NI>(viii) It was Vya1sa who sent Arjuna to the north,
<>Bhi1masena to the east, Sahadeva to the south and
<>Nakula to the west for regional conquest. (M.B. Sabha1
<>Parva, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha, Chapter 26).
<NI>(ix) Vya1sa engaged himself in making various arrange-
<>ments in the Ra1jasu1ya (sacrifice of royal consecration)
<>of Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 33,
<>Stanza 34).
<NI>(x) At the end of the Ra1jasu1ya, Vya1sa predicted the
<>future of Yudhis2t2hira. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 46,
<>Stanza 1).
<NI>(xi) When the Ra1jasu1ya ended, Vya1sa anointed
<>Yudhis2t2hira. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 10).
<NI>(xii) Vya1sa advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to prevent Duryodhana
<>from doing injustice. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 7
<>and 8).
<NI>(xiii) When the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the Dvaita-
<>vana (forest) Vya1sa visited them and taught Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira the art of Pratismr2ti. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>36, Stanza 24).
<NI>(xiv) He sent San5jaya to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to tell him about
<>the greatness of Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 69, Stanza 11).
<NI>(xv) He gave San5jaya the power of having the eye of a
<>seer penetrating beyond time and space (Divya dr2s2t2i).
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 10).
<NI>(xvi) Vya1sa consoled Yudhis2t2hira who was stricken
<>with grief in the course of the battle of Bha1rata. (M.B.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 71, Stanza 23).
<NI>(xvii) When Yudhis2t2hira cried over the death of
<>Ghat2otkaca in the battle of Bha1rata, Vya1sa came to
<>Yudhis2t2hira and consoled him. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 183, Stanza 58).
<NI>(xviii) He talked to As4vattha1ma1 about the greatness of
<>S4iva and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 201,
<>Stanza 56).
<NI>(xix) When Sa1tyaki was about to kill San5jaya, Vya1sa
<>turned him back from the attempt and rescued San5jaya.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 29, Stanza 39).
<NI>(xx) Vya1sa argued and established that the act of
<>cursing As4vattha1ma1 on the part of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was
<>correct. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chapter 16, Stanza 17).
<NI>(xxi) Vya1sa prevented Ga1ndha1ri1 from her intention to
<>curse the Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B. Stri1 Parva, Chapter 14,
<>Stanza 7).
<NI>(xxii) When the battle of Bha1rata was over, Vya1sa
<>advised Yudhis2t2hira about matters regarding the
<>administration of the country.
<NI>(xxiii) Yudhis2t2hira felt grieved at the death of relatives
<>and friends in the battle of Bha1rata and he decided to
<>commit suicide. But Vya1sa dissuaded him from that
<>attempt. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 27, Stanza 28). [Page887-b+ 65]
<NI>(xxiv) Vya1sa walked to the place where Bhi1s2ma lay on
<>the bed of arrows and visited him. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Stanza 5).
<NI>(xxv) Vya1sa advised Yudhis2t2hira to perform As4va-
<>medha (horse sacrifice). (M.B. As4vamedha Parva,
<>Chapter 3, Stanza 8).
<NI>(xxvi) Vya1sa advised the Pa1n2d2avas to go to King
<>Marutta for wealth when the battle of Bha1rata was
<>over. (As4vamedhika Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 20).
<NI>(xxvii) Vya1sa consoled Uttara1, who was lamenting
<>over the death of her husband. (As4vamedha Parva,
<>Chapter 62, Stanza 11).
<NI>(xxviii) He consoled Arjuna who was crying over the
<>death of his son. (As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 62,
<>Stanza 14).
<NI>(xxix) Vya1sa advised Yudhis2t2hira on the various
<>arrangements which were to be made for the conducting
<>of horse-sacrifice. (As4vamedhika Parva, Chapters 62 to
<>72).
<NI>(xxx) Vya1sa went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who had gone to the
<>forest after the Bha1rata-battle and pacified him. (M.B.
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 28).
<NI>(xxxi) Vya1sa brought the spirits of those who died in
<>the Bha1rata-battle, to the surface of the river Ganges,
<>by the power of his penance and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the
<>others saw them. (See under Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Para 7).
<NI>(xxxii) At the instruction of Vya1sa, all the Ks2atriya
<>widows immersed themselves in the river Ganges and
<>everyone of them entered the world of her husband.
<>(M.B. A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 18).
<NI>(xxxiii) When the Yadu-clan was completely destroyed,
<>Arjuna went to the hermitage of Vya1sa and talked with
<>him. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 8).
<NI>(xxxiv) Vya1sa had been an adviser of King Janame-
<>jaya. (See under Janamejaya).
<NI>5) {%Saving a worm.%} Once a wicked man took rebirth as
<>a worm. This worm was crawling in haste for life in
<>front of a cart coming at great speed. He saved the
<>worm and gave it Brahminhood, and in the next birth
<>it became a Brahmin who lived in peace and comfort.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 117).
<NI>6) {%The literary life of Vya1sa.%} Towards the close of his
<>life Vya1sa again entered the caves of Hima1layas. Vya1sa
<>who had steered through a very wide and rough sea of
<>life, was in a position to understand clearly the
<>various sides of human life. In the mind of that sage,
<>who sat in deep contemplation in the eternally silent
<>caves of the Hima1layas, the events of his past life began
<>to line up one after the other. From that inward insti-
<>gation the Pura1n2etiha1sas (the Myths and legends) took
<>form. It might have been during this period that Vya1sa
<>divided the Vedas and composed Pura1n2as and Upa-
<>pura1n2as.
<NI>One does not go wrong in saying that it was the com-
<>posing of the Maha1bha1rata that brought Vya1sa very
<>close to the later generations. The stories of the Kaura-
<>vas and the Pa1n2d2avas, flowed through his mind as a
<>river flows down crushing down the banks on either
<>side. A scribe was necessary to take them down in the
<>form of verses. Vya1sa informed Brahma1 of this need.
<>Brahma1 replied “Gan2apati is the only person capable
<>of taking down every thing that you sing.” Accordingly
<>Vya1sa thought of Gan2apati, who came to the side of
<>Vya1sa, and he informed Gan2apati of his need. Gan2apati
<>said that he was willing to do the work on condition [Page888-a+ 64]
<>that Vya1sa would go on singing unceasingly, so that he
<>might not have to stop the iron pen. Vya1sa said that
<>while he would be singing the poems without stopping,
<>Gan2apati should not take down this and that without
<>grasping the meaning. Both agreed to this condition
<>and the composing of the Maha1bha1rata commenced.
<>Within two years and a half the great poetic work was
<>finished. The great disciples of Vya1sa, such as Vais4am-
<>pa1yana, Jaimini and such others sang them and learned
<>them by heart and published them in the world. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 1).
<NI>7) {%Many Vya1sas.%} It is stated in the Pura1n2as that in
<>every Manu's age, a Vya1sa will be born. It is mention-
<>ed in Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3, Chapter 3, as to who
<>were the persons who took birth as Vya1sa in a parti-
<>cular Manu's age and which were the Vedas and
<>branches of Vedas they had divided. It is given below:
<>During the age of Manu Vaivasvata, in each of the
<>past Dva1parayugas, the Veda had been divided by
<>great hermits, twentyeight times. Twentyeight Veda-
<>Vya1sas have passed, each of whom had divided the
<>Veda into four parts in each Dva1para Yuga. It was
<>Brahma1 himself who had divided the Veda into four in
<>the first Dva1parayuga. Praja1pati was the Vedavya1sa in
<>the second Dva1parayuga. In the third, Vya1sa was the
<>teacher-priest S4ukra; in the fourth Br2haspati; in the
<>fifth the Sun; and in the sixth the all powerful Dharma-
<>ra1ja. It was Indra in the seventh, Vasis2t2ha in the
<>eighth, Sa1rasvata in the ninth, and Tridha1ma1 in the
<>tenth. It was Tris4ikha in the eleventh, Bharadva1ja in
<>the twelfth, Antari1ks2a in the thirteenth, Varn2i1 in the
<>fourteenth, Trayya1run2a in the fifteenth, Dhanan5jaya in
<>the sixteenth, Kratun5jaya in the seventeenth and Jaya
<>in the eighteenth. Next Bharadva1ja comes as Vedavya1sa
<>and Gautama after Bharadva1ja. It was hermit Harya1-
<>tma1 who was the next Vya1sa, and then comes Va1jas4ra-
<>vas. The Next Vya1sa was Tr2n2abindu born in the clan
<>of Somas4us2ma. He was followed by R2ks2a. otherwise
<>called Va1lmi1ki born in the family of Bhr2gu. S4akti is
<>the Next Vya1sa. After that Para1s4ara, then Ja1tu1karn2a
<>and then Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana. They are the twentyeight
<>Vedavya1sas. Each one of these had divided the Veda
<>which had been one at the beginning of each Dva1para-
<>yuga, into four Vedas. It is As4vattha1ma1, the son of
<>Dron2a, who is going to be the Vedavya1s4a of the coming
<>Dva1parayuga.
<NI>8) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Most of the scholars are of opinion that the period
<>of Vya1sa was between 1800 and 1500 B.C.
<NI>(ii) Apa1ntaratamas was the rebirth of Vya1sa. (See
<>under Apa1ntaratamas).

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Vis2n2u were descended in the
<>following order:--Brahma1--Atri--Candra--Budha--
<>Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a--Yaya1ti--Yadu.
<NI>2) {%Yadu Vam3s4a (Ya1dava Vam3s4a).%} The origin of Yadu
<>Vam3s4a is from Atri. Candra, Durva1sas and Datta1treya
<>Muni were the sons of Atri by Anasu1ya1. Budha was
<>born to Candra, Puru1ravas was born to Budha, A1yus
<>was born to Puru1ravas, and Nahus2a was born to A1yus.
<>Two children, A1yati and Yaya1ti were born to Nahus2a.
<>Yaya1ti had two wives, S4armis2t2ha1 and Devaya1ni1. Three [Page889-b+ 65]
<>sons, Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pu1ru were born to
<>S4armis2t2ha1. The Pu1ru vam3s4a takes its origin from Pu1ru.
<>Yaya1ti had two sons by Devaya1ni1. They were Yadu
<>and Turvasu. The descendants of Yadu are the
<>Ya1davas.
<NI>Four sons, Sahasrajit, Kros2t2a1, Nala and Ripu were
<>born to Yadu. Sahasrajit had a son, S4atajit. Three sons
<>Maha1bhaya, Ven2uhaya and Hehaya were born to
<>S4atajit. Of them Hehaya became famous under the
<>name of Ekavi1ra and founded the Hehaya vam3s4a. The
<>Hehayas and Bha1rgavas were on terms of enmity.
<>Dharma was born to Hehaya, and Kunti or Kun2i was
<>born to Dharma. Kun2i had four sons--Sada1jit, Ma1his2-
<>ma1n, Bhadrasena and Durdama. Dhanaka was the son
<>of Bhadrasena and Dhanaka had four sons--Kr2tavi1rya,
<>Kr2ta1gni, Kr2tavarma1 and Kr2taujas. Of them, Kr2tavi1rya
<>who was the eldest, was the father of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<>From here, Yadu vam3s4a continues from Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<>He had five sons, Jayadhvaja, S4u1rasena, Vr2s2abha,
<>Madhu and U1rjjita. Vr2s2n2i was the son of Madhu, the
<>fourth of them. From this point, Yadu vam3s4a continues
<>from Vr2s2n2i. Ya1dava vam3s4a from this stage is also known
<>as Vr2s2n2i vam3s4a. Vr2s2n2i had four sons--Sumitra, Yudha1jit,
<>Vasu and Sa1rvabhauma. Yadu vam3s4a continues from
<>Yudha1jit. He had two sons, S4ini and Nimna. S4ini's son
<>was Satyaka and Satyaka's son was Sa1tyaki. Sa1tyaki
<>had another name, Yuyudha1na. Jaya was Sa1tyaki's son.
<>Kun2i was the son of Jaya, Anamitra was the son of
<>Kun2i and Pr2s4ni was the son of Anamitra. Pr2s4ni's sons
<>were Citraratha and S4vaphalka. Vid2u1ratha and Kuku1ra
<>were born to Citraratha. S4u1ra was the son of Vid2u1ratha.
<>S4ini was the son of S4u1ra, Bhoja was the son of S4ini,
<>Hr2di1ka was the son of Bhoja. Four sons, Devava1ha,
<>Gada1dhanva1, Kr2taparva1 and S4u1ra, were born to Hr2di1ka.
<>S4u1ra married Ma1ris2a1 and their children were Vasu,
<>Devabha1ga, Devas4ravas, A1naka. Sr2n5jaya, Ka1ka1ni1ka,
<>S4ya1maka, Vatsa, Kavu1ka and Vasudeva. Vasudeva
<>married Devaki1, the sister of Kam3sa. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was
<>their son. Pradyumna was the son of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Anirud-
<>dha was the son of Pradyumna and Vajra was the son
<>of Aniruddha. The last known link of that branch of
<>Yadu vam3s4a was Vajra.
<NI>Kam3sa also belonged to Yadu vam3s4a. Kuku1ra who was
<>the brother of Vid2u1ratha was the ancestor of Kam3sa.
<>Ugrasena who was a lineal descendant of Kuku1ra, was
<>the father of Kam3sa. The Pura1n2as mention Devaki1, the
<>mother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a as Kam3sa's sister. But in fact she
<>was not his direct sister. Ugrasena, Kam3sa's father, had
<>a brother named Devaka. This Devaka had three sons,
<>Deva1pa, Upadeva and Sudeva. Devaki1, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's
<>mother was the daughter of Deva1pa. Devaki1 had six
<>sisters who were--S4rutadeva1, S4a1ntideva1, Upadeva1,
<>S4ri1deva1, Devaraks2ita1 and Sahadeva1.
<NI>Akru1ra who went to Amba1d2i also belonged to another
<>branch of Yadu vam3s4a. Pr2s4ni who was of the ninth
<>generation from Vr2s2n2i, had two sons--Citraratha and
<>S4vaphalka. Akru1ra was the son of S4vaphalka.
<NI>3) {%Other details about Yadu Vam3s4a%}
<NI>(i) Once Yaya1ti wanted his son Yadu to transfer the latter's
<>youthfulness to Yaya1ti. The son refused to oblige the
<>father who therefore pronounced a curse that Yadu's
<>descendants would not enjoy kingship. (For detailed
<>story, see under Yaya1ti).
<NI>(ii) Yadu's descendants are called Ya1davas. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 10). [Page890-a+ 65]
<NI>(iii) Yadu was the son of Devaya1ni1 and the grandson
<>of S4ukra1ca1rya. Although Yadu was a hero, he was dull-
<>witted. He did not obey his father. He used to despise
<>his father and brothers. His capital city was Hastina1-
<>pura. He became dull-witted after the loss of his king-
<>dom by the curse of his father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 149).
<NI>4) {%The end of Yadu Vam3s4a.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was one of the most
<>important members of the Yadu Vam3s4a. That family
<>continued only for 36 years more after the end of the
<>Bha1rata Yuddha. At the end of the thirtysix years, evil
<>omens began to appear in Dva1raka1. Whirlwinds began
<>to blow furiously. Frightened birds began to fly helter-
<>skelter. Rivers began to flow upwards. The whole land
<>was enveloped in mist. Comets continued to drop
<>from heaven, scattering sparks of fire. The sun's disc was
<>eclipsed with clouds of dust.
<NI>At that time, one day, the sages Vis4va1mitra, Kan2va and
<>Na1rada happened to come to Dva1raka1. A band of
<>Ya1davas, under the leadership of Sa1mba, gathered round
<>the sages to make fun of them. They dressed Sa1mba like
<>a pregnant woman and asked the sages what child “she”
<>would bear. The enraged sages replied that the “Child”
<>would be an iron pestle which would be the cause of
<>the death of all the Ya1davas. Besides, they added that,
<>with the exception of Ra1ma, (Balabhadra Ra1ma)
<>and Kr2s2n2a, the whole of Ya1dava Vam3s4a would come
<>to ruin.
<NI>Next day Sa1mba did give birth to an iron pestle. The
<>frightened Ya1davas recalled the curse of the sages. They
<>reported the matter to their king. The king, in deep
<>gloom, had the pestle filed into dust and ordered his
<>men to throw the dust into the sea.
<NI>People recalled Ga1ndha1ri1's curse on S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a after the
<>Bha1rata Yuddha. The curse was that the family of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a who was the cause of all mischief, would be wiped
<>out within a period of 36 years.
<NI>At that time, women began to be stolen from Dva1raka1
<>every night by a dark woman monster. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's
<>weapon, Cakra slipped out of Kr2s2n2a's grip and rose up
<>to heaven, in the very presence of the Vr2s2n2is. Seeing
<>these evil omens, the alarmed Vr2s2n2is and Andhakas
<>began to leave the place on a pilgrimage. They reached
<>the shore of Prabha1sa ti1rtha. The Uddhavas parted
<>company with the Ya1davas there. Nobody prevented
<>the Uddhavas. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who saw that the end of the
<>Ya1davas was approaching, also kept silent. The Ya1dava
<>leaders in despair, took to drinking. Intoxicated by
<>drinking they began to quarrel. The particles of the
<>iron pestle thrown into the sea, were carried and deposit-
<>ed on the shore by the waves. They began to sprout in-
<>to a kind of grass. The blades of this grass soon trans-
<>formed themselves into iron pestles. The Ya1davas pulled
<>them out and began attacking each other with them.
<>Most of them were beaten to death by their own kins-
<>folk. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who was in a state of trance in
<>“Yoga1sana”, was hit on his toe by an arrow shot by a
<>hunter and he fell into Sama1dhi. Balabhadra Ra1ma
<>renounced his body and went to Pa1ta1la.
<NI>After that the sea advanced and submerged the whole
<>of Dva1raka1. (M.B. Mausala Parva).
<HI>YADU II. There is another Yadu mentioned in the
<>Pura1n2as, who was the son of Uparicara Vasu. Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 31, says that
<>this Vasu was never defeated by anyone at any time. [Page890-b+ 63]
<HI>YADU III. King of Yadus. There are references to this
<>king in many places in the 1st Man2d2ala of R2gveda.
<HI>YA1JA. A sage born in Kas4yapa gotra. (For further details,
<>see the word Upaya1ja and Pa1n5ca1li1).
<HI>YAJATA. A Yajn5akarta1 (Performer of Yajn5as) celebrated
<>in the R2gveda.
<HI>YAJN5A. An incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. Sva1yambhuva
<>Manu had two sons, Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da and
<>three daughters, A1ku1ti, Devahu1ti and Prasu1ti. Ruci
<>Praja1pati married A1ku1ti. Yajn5a was their son. Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha mentions that this Yajn5a was
<>an incarnation of A1di Na1ra1yan2a.
<NI>Yajn5a had a sister named Daks2in2a1. They were twins.
<>They married each other. The twelve sons who were born
<>to them were the Devas known as Ya1mas, during
<>the Sva1yambhuva Manvantara. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1,
<>Chapter 7).
<NI>Yajn5a's twelve sons were:--Tos2a, Pratos2a, Santos2a,
<>Bhadra, S4a1nti, Id2aspati, Iddhma, Kavi, Vibhu, Sraghna,
<>Sudeva and Virocaka. Their father Yajn5a was the Indra
<>of Sva1yambhuva Manvantara. (Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<HI>YAJN5ABA1HU. An ancient sage who was the son of Priya-
<>vrata and grandson of Sva1yambhuva Manu. Sva1yam-
<>bhuva Manu had two famous sons named Priyavrata
<>and Utta1napa1da. Of these, Priyavrata married Suru1pa1
<>and Barhis2mati1, the two daughters of Vis4vakarma1.
<>Yajn5aba1hu was the son of Priyavrata by Suru1pa1. The ten
<>sons born to Priyavrata and Suru1pa1 were:--Agni1dhra,
<>Iddhmajihva, Yajn5aba1hu, Maha1vi1ra, Rukmas4ukra,
<>Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1tithi, Vi1tihotra and Kavi.
<>They had a daughter, U1rjjasvati1. Bha1gavata, 8th
<>Skandha).
<HI>YAJN5ADATTA I. A youthful sage. In Agni Pura1n2a.
<>Chapter 6, it is stated that this youth was shot dead
<>with an arrow by Das4aratha, mistaking him for an
<>elephant, on the bank of the river Sarayu1. But Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a says that the name of the boy-sage who was
<>shot dead by Das4aratha was “S4ravan2a”. For more
<>details see 3rd Para under Das4aratha.
<HI>YAJN5ADATTA II. A Bra1hman2a. There was a Bra1hman2a
<>village called Mahat at the foot of the Ya1muna mount-
<>ain, between the rivers Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1. This
<>Bra1hman2a was born and brought up here. There is a
<>story in Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 92, about him, which
<>says that by mistake he was taken to hell by Ka1la's
<>messenger and that he was reluctant to leave hell. The
<>story is as follows:--
<NI>Once Yama (Ka1la) ordered his agent to bring the
<>Bra1hman2a named Yajn5adatta, who lived in Mahat village,
<>born in Vasis2t2ha gotra and was gentle, scholarly and
<>well-versed in Yajn5a practices. He was specially warned
<>that he should not make a mistake as there was another
<>Bra1hman2a with the same name who lived in the neigh-
<>bourhood and who resembled Yajn5adatta in appearance,
<>learning and in every other respect. But in spite of Yama's
<>specific warning, his agent brought the wrong person.
<NI>Yama, with his sense of justice, received him with due
<>respect and allowed him to return to the world. But
<>Yajn5adatta was not willing to return to the world.
<HI>YAJN5ADATTA III. See under Pa1t2ali1putra.
<HI>YAJN5AS4ARMA1. A Bra1hman2a made famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>He was the son of S4ivas4arma1. (For detailed story, see
<>under S4ivas4arma1). [Page891-a+ 64]
<HI>YAJN5AS4ATRU. A Ra1ks2asa who fought against Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the forest. Khara, Du1s2an2a and Tris4iras
<>were the three Ra1ks2asas who declared war on S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. Yajn5as4atru was one of the twelve military com-
<>manders of Khara. Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>26th Sarga, mentions that the twelve heroes who were
<>Khara's commanders were:- S4yenaga1mi1, Pr2thugri1va,
<>Yajn5as4atru, Vihan3gama, Durjaya, Karavi1ra1ks2a, Parus2a.
<>Ka1laka1rmuka, Meghama1li1, Maha1ma1li1, Sarpa1sya and
<>Rudhira1s4ana.
<HI>YAJN5ASENA I. See under Pan5catantra.
<HI>YAJN5ASENA II. Drupada, the son of King of Pa1n5ca1la.
<>(For more details see under Drupada).
<HI>YAJN5AVA1HA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. There is a
<>reference to him in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>45, Verse 80.
<HI>YA1JN5AVALKYA. An ancient sage who was a profound
<>scholar.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Pura1n2as say that this sage spent the major
<>part of his life at the court of King Janaka. He was
<>also King Janaka's priest. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 16,
<>it is mentioned that Kalki was Ya1jn5avalkya's priest.
<>Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 51,
<>mentions that Ya1jn5avalkya was a “Brahmava1di1 son” of
<>Vis4va1mitra.
<NI>2) {%Thousand cows.%} Once King Janaka conducted a
<>Ya1ga. At that time he wished to find out the most
<>eminent among the sages. He promised to present a
<>thousand cows to the sage who was a consummate
<>scholar. A bag of gold coins was also tied to each horn
<>of the cows. Janaka announced that the sage who claim-
<>ed to be a consummate scholar might come forward and
<>take the cows with him. No one among the numerous
<>sages who were present, dared to come forward. Ya1jn5a-
<>valkya, however, ordered his disciple to take the cows
<>home with him. The other sages questioned his right to
<>claim the cows. Ya1jn5avalkya asserted his right to do so.
<>One of the sages named Arthabha1ga stood up and
<>asked him the following question:--
<NI>Arthabha1ga:--When a man who has not acquired
<>divine knowledge dies, his “Jn5a1nendriyas” (senses of
<>knowledge) are also merged with it. How is it possible
<>for him to accept another body afterwards? “Ya1jn5a-
<>valkya:--Karma (action) becomes the cause of his re-
<>birth.”
<NI>Next Kahola and many other sages put various ques-
<>tions to him. The substance of their talk is given
<>below:--
<NI>Kahola:--What have you to say about the invisible
<>and omnipresent Brahman?
<NI>Ya1jn5avalkya:--Your soul is the omni-present Brahman.
<>The soul has no hunger or thirst, fear or desire, old age
<>or death. Those who wish to know the soul, become
<>sages after transcending love of wife, children or world-
<>ly riches. The two qualities essential for sages are
<>scholarship and spiritual knowledge.
<NI>Ga1rgi1:--Who is the warp and woof of everything?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--It is Brahman. Do not ask further; if you do,
<>your head will be broken to pieces.
<NI>A1run2i:--Who is he who exists within? (Antarya1mi1).
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--He who is contained in Jagat (the universe)
<>without the knowledge of Jagat, he whose body is
<>Jagat, he who controls Jagat as antarya1mi1, he is within
<>every one. He cannot be seen, but he sees. He cannot [Page891-b+ 65]
<>be heard; but he hears. He is capable of thinking; but
<>he is beyond our thoughts. He exists as one who sees,
<>hears and thinks, in all creatures.
<NI>Ga1rgi1:--I have two questions to ask. They are as sharp
<>and pointed as two arrows. By what force is fixed that
<>which is above Heaven, below the earth and that
<>which is between them, like warp and woof?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--By the sky.
<NI>Ga1rgi1:--By what force is the sky held in position like
<>warp and woof?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--Under the command of God, the sun and
<>moon do not deviate from their orbits. The sky and the
<>earth remain in their respective places. Rivers run mak-
<>ing the fields fertile. One who lives and works without
<>the ability to know God does not obtain immortality.
<>He who dies without knowing God is a Kr2pan2a (spirit-
<>ual bankrupt). On the contrary, he who knows God
<>attains Moks2a.
<NI>S4a1kalya:--How many gods are there?
<NI>Ya1jn3a:--Thirtythree. They are--8 Vasus, 11 Rudras,
<>12 A1dityas, Indra and Praja1pati. The 8 Vasus are--
<>Agni, Pr2thvi1, Va1yu, Antari1ks2a, A1ditya, Dyau (Heaven),
<>Candra and Stars. The 11 Rudras are the combination
<>of the 10 jn5a1nendriyas and the working of the mind.
<>The ruling deities of the 12 months are known as the
<>12 A1dityas. They receive into them our lives and our
<>Karmans (actions).
<NI>Ya1jn5avalkya gave suitable answers to all other ques-
<>tions of S4a1kalya. At last, he asked S4a1kalya:--“Now I
<>will ask you a question. Whom do the Upanis2ads
<>describe? If you do not answer, your head will break.”
<>S4a1kalya could not answer it. He dropped down with a
<>broken head. He asked the other scholars who had
<>gathered there, if any of them wanted to ask him more
<>questions. But no one came forward. All remained
<>dumb. Then he continued:--“Fresh leaves sprout
<>from a tree which has been cut. If the seed is destroy-
<>ed, the tree does not grow out of it. How is it that a
<>man is born again after his death?”
<NI>No one was able to answer that question. Thus after
<>defeating all of them in argument, Ya1jn5avalkya went
<>home with the cows.
<NI>3) {%In Janaka's court again.%} On another occasion,
<>Ya1jn5avalkya went to see King Janaka. The King asked
<>him whether he had come for getting cows or to ask
<>abstruse question. The sage answered that he had come
<>for both. Their conversation continued as follows:--
<NI>Janaka:--Jita Muni has said that “Vacana” (word) is
<>Brahman or God. What is your opinion?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--It is correct. But did he say which is the body
<>and abode of God?
<NI>Janaka:--No.
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--In that case he has said only onefourth about
<>God. Vacana is god's body and sky, his abode. Brahma-
<>vidya1 depends on the word. The word is Parabrahman.
<>Janaka was highly pleased. He decided to give a thou-
<>sand bulls to the sage. But Ya1jn5avalkya said that his
<>father's principle was to give effective knowledge to the
<>pupil and not to receive any daks2in2a1 (Payment) from
<>him. Janaka again wanted Ya1jn5avalkya to explain
<>clearly what “Brahma Vidya1” means.
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--Just as a person can reach his destination by
<>walking or by travelling in a chariot or by sailing in a
<>boat, in order to secure peace for the soul, you are
<>depending on the Upanis2ads. But although one is [Page892-a+ 65]
<>learned in Vedas and A1gamas, or adored by others or
<>wealthy, or well-versed in Upanis2ads, unless one has
<>known God--unless one acquired Brahmajn5a1na--one
<>cannot be said to be gratified. Do you know where you
<>will go after renouncing your body?
<NI>Janaka:--I do not know.
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--I shall tell you. The deity of the right eye is
<>“Inda” (light). People call it “Indra”. The deity of
<>the left eye is Indra1n2i1, the wife of Indra. Indra is eater
<>and Indra1n2i1 is food. In a state of consciousness they
<>are separated. (Then the soul is called Vais4va1nara).
<>In a state of dream, the two are united. (Then the
<>soul is called Taijasa). In a state of slumber, the soul
<>is in “Prjn5a1a” state. (Since there is no activity it is
<>called Pra1jn5a). In the fourth or “Turi1ya” state, one
<>becomes capable of transcending the three other states
<>and to attain Parabrahman. It is a state of fearlessness
<>transcending birth and death.
<NI>The King who was pleased by this teaching dedicated
<>the kingdom of Videha and even himself to the sage.
<NI>4) {%In Janaka's court for the third time.%} After some years
<>Ya1jn5avalkya went again to Janaka's court. At that time
<>also there was a philosophical discussion between the
<>King and the sage in the form of questions and answers.
<NI>Janaka:--Which is the light that gives us guidance
<>during the day time?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--The Sun.
<NI>Janaka:--After sunset which is the light that guides us?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--The Moon.
<NI>Janaka:--And in the absence of the sun and moon?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--Agni.
<NI>Janaka:--Which is the light that guides us in the
<>absence of the sun, moon and Agni?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--Vacana.
<NI>Janaka:--Which is the light that shines in the absence
<>of all these luminaries?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--A1tmajyotis (soul's light).
<NI>Janaka:--Who is A1tman?
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--“Purus2a” who is formed by the union of
<>“vya1na” in pra1n2as (lives) and jyotis (light) in the
<>heart. The soul is disposed to action with the help of
<>intelligence. In the end it transcends the body, senses
<>and mind and attains Moks2a. In the state of conscious-
<>ness the soul's activities become manifest to us. When
<>in sleep, after deputing “Pra1n2a” for the protection of
<>the body, the soul remains outside the body. The senses
<>become inactive. Therefore we should never wake up
<>one who is asleep. When the soul remains in the body
<>and the senses are active, it is in a most vigilant state.
<>Thus the soul is above the states of wakefulness, dream
<>and slumber. The soul is the divine light of pure
<>energy.
<NI>Janaka who was pleased, gave the sage a thousand
<>cows more. After that Ya1jn5avalkya spoke about libera-
<>tion from worldly bonds.
<NI>Ya1jn5a:--The soul has no connection with the three
<>conditions. Just as the actions in a dream do not affect
<>the soul, the actions in a wakeful state also do not
<>affect it. Just as a fish jumps from one side of the river
<>to the other and back again, life keeps jumping from
<>the state of wakefulness to the state of slumber and vice
<>versa.
<NI>Just as a kite goes up flying and then comes back to its
<>nest, one moves from the state of wakefulness to sleep
<>and back again. In deep slumber, he merges with God, [Page892-b+ 64]
<>but he does not know that. In that state, the father or
<>the mother does not have the knowledge that they are
<>the father or mother.
<NI>After that Ya1jn5avalkya explained the nature of the soul
<>and the various aspects of its working in a state of wake-
<>fulness and of slumber. He added:--“As long as there
<>is “Ka1ma” (desire) there is “Karman” also. Life goes
<>on passing from birth to death and from death to birth.
<>One attains perfection when one is above all desires,
<>and acquires the highest divine knowledge. He is liber-
<>ated from birth and death and becomes immortal.
<NI>By jn5a1na, da1na and tapas we become self-purified and
<>thus become worthy of the highest divine grace. We
<>have to go from the world of Karman (action) to the
<>world of a1tman (soul). One who has acquired Brahma-
<>jn5a1na (knowledge of Brahman) becomes a Bra1hman2a.
<>Hearing these famous teachings of Ya1jn5avalkya, Janaka
<>became his permanent disciple.
<NI>5) {%His end.%} Ya1jn5avalkya had two wives named Kalya1n2i1
<>and Maitreyi1. After giving his all to his wives he passed
<>into immortality. (Br2hada1ran2yaka; M.B. S4a1nt2i Parva,
<>Chapters 3-9).
<NI>6) {%His works.%} Ya1jn5avalkya has written a Smr2ti on the
<>subject of law. “Mita1ks2ara1” is its famous commentary.
<>Mita1ks2ara1 is the highest authoritative treatise on Law
<>in South India.
<NI>7) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Ya1jn5avalkya flourished in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 12).
<NI>(ii) He was also a member of Indra's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 12).
<NI>(iii) Ya1jn5avalkya was the priest at the Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a
<>of Dharmaputra. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 33,
<>Verse 35).
<NI>(iv) Ya1jn5avalkya had his knowledge of Vedas from
<>Su1ryadeva. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 318, Verse 6).
<HI>YAJURVEDA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The Caturvedas are:--R2gveda, Yajurveda
<>Sa1maveda and Atharvaveda. Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3,
<>Chapter 5, mentions that Vais4ampa1yana, the disciple of
<>Vedavya1sa, divided Yajurveda into twentyseven branch-
<>es and taught them to his disciples. Among those disci-
<>ples there was Ya1jn5avalkya, the son of Brahmara1ta. It
<>was Vya1sa who divided the Vedas into four parts. After
<>di1viding them, the sage Vya1sa taught R2gveda to Paila,
<>Yajurveda to Vais4ampa1yana, Sa1maveda to Jaimini and
<>Atharvaveda to Sumantu.
<NI>The rules for Japa, Homa etc. of Yajurveda were taught
<>to Vya1sa by Agnideva. If all the rules of Yajurveda
<>are correctly observed, all desires will be fulfilled.
<>There are special rules for the observance of homa for
<>the fulfilment of particular desires.
<HI>YAKR2LLOMA1. An Indian town. (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 46).
<HI>YAKS2A.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A class of Semi-gods. There are chiefly
<>three classes of inhabitants in Heaven:--Devas, Gan2a-
<>devas and Upadevas. Gan2adevas consist of the 12
<>A1dityas, 10 Vis4vadevas, 8 Vasus, 36 Tus2itas, 64 A1bha1s-
<>varas, 49 Anilas 220 Maha1ra1jikas, 12 Sa1dhyas and 11
<>Rudras.
<NI>Among the Upadevas there are 10 subdivisions. They
<>are, Vidya1dharas, Apsaras, Yaks2as, Ra1ks2asas, Gandhar-
<>vas, Kinnaras, Pis4a1cas, Guhyakas, Siddhas and Bhu1tas. [Page893-a+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} There are different views relating to the
<>origin of the Yaks2as. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter l we find that the Yaks2as took birth after
<>Brahma1's birth from “Vira1t2 Purus2a's” an2d2a. According
<>to a statement in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 19, Yaks2as and
<>Ra1ks2asas were born from Muni1, the grand daughter of
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati. Thus Yaks2as and Ra1ks2asas are relat-
<>ed as brothers. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 7, there is another passage which says that Yaks2as
<>are the progeny of the sage Pulastya.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}
<NI>i) Once S4ukadeva sang the story of Maha1bha1rata to the

<>Chapter 111, Verse 10).
<NI>(v) Bhi1masena once drove away Yaks2as and Ra1ks2asas.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 16, Verse 57).
<NI>(vi) On another occasion, Sunda and Upasunda defeated
<>and persecuted the Yaks2as. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 208, verse 7).
<HI>YAKS2AGRAHA. A Graha (Evil Spirit) connected with
<>Yaks2as. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 230, Verse
<>53, mentions that people become mad owing to the ad-
<>verse influence of this Graha.
<HI>YAKS2AVA1T2A. A place made famous in the Pura1n2as. In
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha, there is a statement say-
<>ing that it was at this place that the Da1nava called
<>Rambha took a she-buffalo as his wife.
<HI>YAKS2AYUDDHAPARVA. A sub-division of Vana Parva,
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Chapters 158 to 164 of Vana Parva,
<>are included in this sub-division.
<HI>YAKS2ES4VARA. An incarnation of S4iva. The devas
<>were puffed with pride when they secured Amr2ta by
<>churning the ocean of milk. In order to allay their
<>pride, S4iva took birth as Yaks2es4vara.
<NI>One day he put a blade of grass on the ground before
<>them and asked them to take it up. Although
<>the Devas tried their best, they were not able even to
<>move it. It was only then that they became convinced
<>of their own incapacity. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atarudra
<>Sam3hita1).
<HI>YAKS2I1 (YAKS2IN2I1). Women folk of Yaks2as. Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 50 mentions that the images of Yaks2i1
<>to be installed in temples should have fixed and
<>long eyes. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 54,
<>Verse 105, states that Yaks2in2i1 is a Devi1 and by eating
<>the prasa1da (naivedya) of the Devi1 one would be absolv-
<>ed of the sin of Brahmahatya1 (killing a Bra1hman2a).
<HI>YAKS2IN2I1 TI1RTHA. A famous sacred place situated
<>on the borders of Kuruks2etra. By bathing at this place
<>one's desires would be fulfilled. The place is also
<>famous for offering worship to the Pitr2s. A visit to this
<>place will be rewarded with the benefit of As4vamedha
<>Ya1ga. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83,
<>Verse 23 mentions that this ti1rtha was founded by
<>Paras4ura1ma.
<HI>YAKS2MA1 (RA1JAYAKS2MA1). The disease of consump-

<HI>YAMADU1TA. One of the Brahmava1di1 sons of Vis4va1mitra.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 51).
<HI>YAMAJIHVA1. A prostitute. In Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>S4aktiyas4olambaka, 1st Taran3ga, there is a story about
<>her as follows:--
<NI>In the city of Citraku1t2a Ratnavarma1 a wealthy Vais4ya,
<>had a son named I1s4varavarma1. In order to avoid his
<>son falling under the influence of prostitutes, the father
<>decided to teach “ves4ya1tantram”, to I1s4varavarma1
<>while he was a boy. Yamajihva1, the prostitute under-
<>took this task for a reward of 1000 Nis2kas. (a gold coin
<>of that time).
<NI>After completing his education on the wiles and tricks
<>of prostitutes, he was sent by his father to start a trade
<>with a capital of five crores of Nis2kas. I1s4varavarma1
<>and his friend Arthadatta on their way, stopped at a
<>park on the outskirts of the city of Ka1n5canapura.
<>There he fell a victim to the bewitching charms of a
<>prostitute named Sundari1. He spent the lion's share of
<>the money given by his father, on her. On the advice of
<>his friend Arthadatta he was about to leave the place
<>when Sundari1 pretended to be in danger of falling into
<>a well and asked for his help. I1s4varavarma1 was again
<>caught in her trap and he was forced to spend the res
<>of his money also on her. When he was rendered penni-
<>less the prostitute and her mother deserted him.
<NI>I1s4varavarma1 returned home to his father, empty-hand-
<>ed. Ratnavarma1 took his son to Yamajihva1 again and
<>told her the whole story. He said that his son fell into
<>this plight because Yamajihva1's training was not effect-
<>ive. After listening to the whole story, Yamajihva1
<>promised to recover the whole amount lost by I1s4vara-
<>varma1. She brought her trained monkey named “A1la”
<>and placed 1,000 Nis2kas before him. She taught him to
<>swallow the whole amount. After that, she taught him
<>to give out by vomiting, the swallowed money in instal-
<>ments of twenty, thirty, forty etc., as ordered. Then
<>Yamajihva1 said to I1s4varavarma1:--“Take this monkey
<>with you and go to Sundari1's place. Make him swallow
<>the money in secret and get it again from him, in
<>instalments, in her presence. She would think that the
<>monkey is an inexhaustible source of wealth and
<>would be prepared to buy it at any cost--even
<>by offering her whole wealth in return. At first you
<>must pretend to be unwilling to part with the monkey.
<>In the end, you must make him swallow 2,000 Nis2kas
<>which he would be able to give out in two days at the
<>rate of 1,000 on each day. Exchange him for her whole
<>wealth and leave the place immediately.”
<NI>With this advice Yamajihva1 sent I1s4varavarma1 with the
<>monkey. He went to Ka1n5canapura in the company of
<>his friend Arthadatta after receiving two crores of Nis2kas
<>from his father. When Sundari1 knew that I1s4varavarma1
<>had come again with more money, she welcomed him
<>with due respect and invited him to live with her. He
<>accepted her invitation and took up his residence there.
<>One day, he brought the monkey into the house and in
<>the presence of Sundari1 asked him to produce various
<>amounts of money for different purposes.
<NI>The monkey promptly vomited the various amounts
<>separately without making any mistake. Sundari1 and
<>her mother Makarakat2i1 were naturally amazed at the [Page894-a+ 65]
<>marvellous performance of the monkey. I1s4varavarma1
<>explained that the monkey was capable of giving in this
<>way, 1,000 Nis2kas daily. Sundari1 made up her mind to
<>purchase the wonderful animal at any price. She request-
<>ed I1s4varavarma1 to give her the monkey in exchange for
<>the crores of Nis2kas she had taken from him earlier.
<>But he turned down her request. At last she persuaded
<>him to sell the monkey to her for the entire wealth she
<>possessed. I1s4varavarma1 secretly made the monkey
<>swallow 2,000 Nis2kas before handing it over to Sundari1
<>and left the place at once to go to Svarn2advi1pa for
<>trade.
<NI>A1la, the monkey gave Sundari1 1,000 Nis2kas on each of
<>the first two days, but on the third day she was disillu-
<>sioned. In her disappointment and anger, she beat A1lan.
<>The enraged monkey attacked both Sundari1 and
<>Makarakat2i1 and harmed them by biting and tearing
<>with its nails. They in turn, beat him to death. Thus
<>Sundari1 lost all her ill-gotten wealth and was reduced to
<>utter poverty and distress.
<HI>YAMAKA. A region in ancient India. The inhabitants
<>of this place were called “Yamakas”. Maha1bha1rata,

<>by the princes and people of Yamaka at Yudhis2t2hira's
<>As4vamedhayajn5a.

<>is illuminated with sun-light it has an equable tempera-
<>ture. Sadness, old age, hunger or thirst are unknown
<>there. There is a dense growth of Kalpavr2ks2as. All the
<>dead people who were famous in ancient times are
<>members of this assembly.
<HI>YAMI1. A daughter of Su1rya. One of the wives of Su1rya
<>was Sam3jn5a1, the daughter of Vis4vakarma1. Three
<>children, Manu, Yama and Yami1, were born to Su1rya
<>by Sam3jn5a1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<HI>YA1MI1. A wife of Dharmadeva. The ten wives of
<>Dharmadeva are--Arundhati1, Vasu, Ya1mi1, Lamba1,

<>of the wives of Kas4yapa. (Bha1gavata, 6th Skandha).
<HI>YAMUNA1. Another name for the river Ka1lindi1. (See
<>also under Ka1lindi1).
<NI>1) {%How the water in Ka1lindi1 turned Black:%}-The water in
<>the river Ka1lindi is black in colour. There is a story
<>behind the changing of the colour of this river-water
<>into black. Originally it was clear.
<NI>After the death of Sati1, Daks2a's daughter, S4iva broke
<>up Daks2a ya1ga and went about rambling round the
<>world. Ka1madeva who saw S4iva who had lost his wife
<>(Sati1) shot him with “Unma1da1stra” (an arrow causing
<>madness and excitement). S4iva, in his excitement,
<>always thinking about Sati1, wandered about, finding
<>peace and rest nowhere. In his excited and restless
<>state he plunged himself into Ka1lindi1 river. Just then,
<>the clear water of the river turned black. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<NI>2) {%The greatness of Ka1lindi1 (Yamuna1).%} The Pura1n2as
<>declare that by bathing in the holy Ka1lindi1 one attains
<>heaven. There is a stroy illustrating this in Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 30, as follows:--
<NI>Long ago, in Kr2tayuga, there lived in the country of [Page894-b+ 65]
<>Nis2adha, a very wealthy Vais4ya, by name Hemakun2-
<>d2ala. By doing various kinds of business, he had earned
<>eight crores of golden coins. By that time he was advanc-
<>ing in age. At this stage he began to think of the transi-
<>toriness of worldly pleasures and set apart one-sixth of
<>his entire wealth for charitable purposes. He built two
<>temples--one for Vis2n2u and the other for S4iva. He
<>offered daily worship to the gods and spent money in
<>generous hospitality. His two sons, S4ri1kun2d2ala and
<>Vikun2d2ala were growing up. He entrusted the burden
<>of domestic affairs to them and went to the forest to
<>perform austere tapas, after which he attained Vis2n2u-
<>loka.
<NI>His sons, who were intoxicated with their affluent and
<>luxurious life, deviated from the path of virtue and
<>began to indulge in all kinds of sensual pleasures. It
<>did not take long for them to be reduced to utter
<>poverty. Their relatives and dependants left them to
<>their fate and at last, they began to resort to stealing.
<>For fear of the King, the public and the law, they
<>changed their residence to the woods. One of them
<>went to a mountain and the other to a forest. One day,
<>the elder brother was caught by a tiger and the younger
<>was bit by a snake. Both of them died on the same day.
<>Yama's agents took both to Yamaloka. Dharmara1ja
<>(Yama) ordered the elder brother to be sent to Naraka
<>(Hell) and the younger one (Vikun2d2ala) to be sent to
<>Heaven.
<NI>Vikun2d2ala who knew that he did not deserve Heaven
<>by any standards, asked Yama's agent how this had
<>happened. The agent gave him this answer:--“There
<>was a Bra1hman2a well-versed in Vedic lore, who was the
<>son of Harimitra. His a1s4rama was on the southern bank
<>of Yamuna1. While you were living in the forest, you were
<>associated with him. As a result of that contact, it so
<>happened that you bathed for two months in the holy
<>river Ka1lindi1, the waters of which have the power of
<>absolving sinners. By your bath in the first month
<>you were liberated from all sins. By the second you
<>have become eligible for Heaven. You have qualified
<>yourself for the eternal bliss of Heaven, by that holy
<>act.”
<NI>Yamuna1 is being worshipped as a goddess. Devotees of
<>this goddess imagine her as riding on a tortoise, carry-
<>ing a water pot in her hand and is of black complexion.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 50).
<HI>YA1MUNA I. A town in ancient India. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 51).
<HI>YA1MUNA II. A mountain, made famous in the Pura1-
<>n2as, standing between the rivers Ga1n3ga1 and Yamuna1.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 3).
<HI>YAMUNA1DVI1PA. An island in the river Yamuna1. It
<>was on this island that Vya1sa was conceived as the
<>result of the union of sage Para1s4ara with Satyavati1.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 60, Verse 2).
<HI>YAMUNA1PRABHAVA. A sacred place. Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 44, mentions that the
<>man who bathes here obtains the reward of As4vamedha
<>Ya1ga and enters Heaven.
<HI>YAMUNA1TI1RTHA. A holy ti1rtha on the bank of the
<>river Sarasvati1. Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>49, Verse 11, refers to a Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a performed at
<>this place by Varun2a, the son of Aditi.
<HI>YA1NA. One of the royal qualities like Sandhi, Vigraha
<>etc. (For more details see under S2ad2gun2as). [Page895-a+ 65]

<>He was one of the chief characters in the sixth story
<>told by the famous Veta1la in Katha1saritsa1gara.
<HI>YAS4AS. Father of Kalki, the tenth incarnation of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 16, mentions that towards
<>the end of Kaliyuga all people will become atheists,
<>there will be an intermixture of castes and all people
<>will become thieves and devoid of virtue. At that time,
<>the 15 branches of the Veda called Va1jasaneyas alone
<>will be the authority. Mlecchas (low-class people)
<>assuming the form of Kings will begin to eat human
<>beings. Agni Pura1n2a states further that at that time,
<>Lord Vis2n2u will incarnate as Kalki, the son of Yas4as
<>and Ya1jn5avalkya's priest and after training himself in
<>archery and weapons, annihilate all Mlecchas.
<HI>YAS4ASVINI1 I. A woman follower of Subrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 10).
<HI>YAS4ASVINI1 II. A sister of Pa1n5ca1li1. (Bha1gavata, 9th
<>Skandha).
<HI>YA1SKA. A famous Sanskrit Grammarian of ancient times.
<>Although the people of India always believed in the
<>greatness of the Vedas, the Vedas became unintelli-
<>gible even to scholars owing to changes in language and
<>differences in grammar. It was Ya1ska and Sa1yan2a who
<>saved the country from that plight. Ya1ska became famous
<>by composing “Nirukta” (etymology). There is a refer-
<>ence to this ancient sage in Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 342,
<>Verse 72.
<HI>YAS4OBHADRA. A son of King Manobhadra. Padma-
<>Pura1n2a, Kriya1khan2d2a mentions that Yas4obhadra happen-
<>ed to be born in a royal family because in his previous
<>birth he had bathed in the Gan3ga1.
<HI>YAS4ODA1. Foster-mother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. How she became
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's fostermother, is explained in a story given
<>in Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha:--
<NI>Once Dron2a, one of the As2t2avasus, and his wife Dhara1,
<>caused displeasure to Brahma1. In his anger, Brahma1
<>cursed them to be born in the world as human beings
<>and to spend a life-time on earth, tending cattle.
<>Dron2a became sad and with tears in his eyes, prayed to
<>Brahma1 that during his life on earth he should be bless-
<>ed with Vis2n2u's dars4ana. Brahma1 granted that prayer.
<>It was in fulfilment of this prayer that Dron2a was born
<>as Nandagopa and Dhara1 as Yas4oda1 in Amba1d2i.
<HI>YAS4ODHARA I. Son of Durmukha, who fought on the
<>side of the Pa1n2d2avas against the Kauravas. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter 184, Verse 5).
<HI>YAS4ODHARA II. A son of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a by Rukmin2i1devi1.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33).

<>married by Hasti, King of the Pu1ru dynasty and they a
<>had a son named Vikan2t2ha. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>95, Verse 35).
<HI>YAS4OVATI1 I. The name of I1s4a1na's city. Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>8th Skandha mentions that god I1s4a1na, the ruler of the
<>north-eastern part, lives in the city called Yas4ovati1.

<>cial fire when King Vr2s2a1darbhi performed a ya1ga. As
<>directed by the king, she proceeded to the forest to des-
<>troy the Saptars2is. She remained there as the owner of
<>the tank in which the sages used to take bath. Seeing
<>her standing alone there, they enquired who she was.
<>She answered that she was guarding the tank. She allow-
<>ed them to enter into the tank after each of them explain-
<>ed the meaning of his name. Accordingly, the sages
<>Atri, Vasis2t2ha, Kas4yapa, Vis4va1mitra, Gautama and
<>Bharadva1ja explained the meaning of their names be-
<>fore getting down into the tank. At last when sage
<>S4unassakha's turn came, he said that he was not pre-
<>pared to explain in detail, the meaning of his name and
<>that she should be satisfied with his statement that he
<>was the sage S4unassakha. Ya1tudha1ni1 became angry on
<>hearing it and insisted on his giving the meaning of his
<>name. S4unassakha with a single stroke with his
<>“tridan2d2a” (trident) killed her. S4unassakha was really
<>Indra himself. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 93).

<HI>YAVANA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} There are many references to Yavanas and
<>the land of Yavanas in the Pura1n2as. There is a statement
<>in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 34, that
<>the Yavana rase takes its source from Turvasu, the son
<>of Yaya1ti. There is another version in Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 174, Verse 36, that Yavanas were
<>born from the womb and the sides of Nandini1.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Arjuna's brother Sahadeva once conquered the Yavana
<>land. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Verse 73).
<NI>(ii) Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 32, Verse 17,

<NI>(vi) Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 65
<>states that at the time of Maha1bha1rata, Yavana land
<>was part of India.
<NI>(vii) Originally Yavanas were Ks2atriyas. But they be-
<>came S4u1dras by the curse of Bra1hman2as. (M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 35, Verse 18).
<NI>(viii) Once there was a duel between a Yavana king
<>and Mucukunda. (For further details, see under Mucu-
<>kunda).
<HI>YAVASA. A particular region of Plaks2advi1pa. Bha1gavata,
<>5th Skandha says that Plaks2advi1pa had seven divisions
<>which were-S4ivam, Yavasam, Subhadram, S4a1ntam,
<>Moks2am, Amr2tam and Abhayam.
<HI>YAVI1NARA. A king of the Pu1ru dynasty. Ba1hya1s4va was
<>his father. Five sons were born to Ba1hya1s4va. They were

<HI>YA1YA1TA. An ancient holy place in India. King Yaya1ti
<>conducted a Ya1ga at this place. From that time the
<>place became sacred. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 41,
<>Verse 32).
<HI>YAYA1TI. An eminent king of the Lunar dynasty.
<NI>1.) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Vis2n2u were descended
<>in the following order--Brahma1--Atri--Candra--Budha
<>-Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a--Yaya1ti.
<NI>Sage Atri had three sons--Candra, Durva1sas and Datta1-
<>treya--by his wife Anasu1ya1. Candra's son was Budha,
<>Budha's son was Puru1ravas, Puru1ravas's son was A1yus,
<>A1yus's son was Nahus2a who had six sons--Yati, Yaya1ti,
<>Sam3ya1ti, A1ya1ti, Ayati and Dhruva. Yaya1ti had two
<>wives, Devaya1ni1 and S4armis2t2ha1. Two sons, Yadu and
<>Turvasu, were born to Devaya1ni. Of them, Yadu became
<>the founder of Yaduvam3s4a. S4armis2t2ha1 had three sons
<>who were Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pu1ru. The Puru-
<>vam3s4a traces its origin to Puru.
<NI>2). {%Yaya1ti's marriage.%} Yaya1ti married Devaya1ni1, the
<>daughter of sage S4ukra and S4armis2t2ha1, the daughter of
<>Vr2s2aparva1.
<NI>There is a story behind this marriage, given in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 76. [Page896-b+ 64]
<>Once there was keen rivalry between Devas and Asuras.
<>For achieving victory Devas accepted Br2haspati and
<>Asuras accepted S4ukra as their preceptors. Although
<>Devas slaughtered all Asuras they were restored to life
<>by S4ukra by the power of his mantra. Devas and Asuras
<>resumed their battle. “Mr2tasan5ji1vani1” (the art of revi-
<>ving the dead) was then unknown to the gods. Devas
<>sent the handsome youth Kaca to S4ukra, to learn
<>Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 from him. There, Kaca fell in love with
<>Devaya1ni1, S4ukra's daughter. But after acquiring the
<>knowledge about Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 he returned, without
<>marrying Devaya1ni1. At the time of his departure, Kaca
<>and Devaya1ni1 cursed each other. Devaya1ni1's curse was
<>that Kaca's newly acquired knowledge would not
<>produce the desired result, while Kaca's curse was that
<>Devaya1ni1 would not be married by any youthful r2s2i.
<NI>S4armis2t2ha1 was the daughter of Vr2s2aparva1, the Daitya
<>king. Devaya1ni1 was the daughter of S4ukra, the Daitya
<>preceptor. One day they were enjoying a bath in a
<>forest brook with their maids, after leaving their clothes
<>on the bank of the stream. At that time Devendra who
<>came that way, transformed himself into a strong wind
<>and carried all the clothes to a place and put all of
<>them in a heap. Seeing this, the women rushed out of
<>the water and in the hurried confusion in snatching
<>their garments Devaya1ni1 and S4armis2t2ha1 happened to
<>put on each other's clothes. A quarrel took place bet-
<>ween them on this mistake and the angry S4armis2t2ha1
<>pushed Devaya1ni1 into an unused well. Thinking that
<>Devaya1ni1 was dead, S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids went to
<>the palace.
<NI>At this time, Yaya1ti who was a king of the lunar dynasty
<>happened to come there exhausted after his hunting.
<>After rescuing Devaya1ni1 from the well and enquiring
<>about her identity and the circumstances in which she
<>fell into the well, he returned to his palace
<NI>Devaya1ni1 sent her maid Ghu1rn2ika1 to her father and in-
<>formed him about her mishap. The father, sage S4ukra
<>became angry towards Vr2s2aparva1, and came down from
<>Daityaloka and settled down in the forest with his dau-
<>ghter. Afraid of his preceptor's curse and anger, Vr2s2a-
<>parva1 came to S4ukra and offered profuse apologies to him
<>for his daughter's misconduct. But S4ukra answered
<>that he would be prepared to forgive only if S4armis2t2ha1
<>with 1000 maids would go and serve Devaya1ni1. Finding
<>no other way, Vr2s2aparva1 yielded to the condition. Soon
<>S4armis2t2ha1 and her 1000 maids went to the forest and
<>began to serve Devaya1ni1. S4ukra returned to Daityaloka.
<>Some time after this, Yaya1ti came to the forest one day
<>for hunting. There he met Devaya1ni1, being attended
<>by many maids. In the conversation that followed, Deva-
<>ya1ni1 was able to recognize Yaya1ti. She fell in love with
<>him. But Yaya1ti insisted that he was not prepared to
<>marry her without the consent of S4ukra1ca1rya. So she
<>sent one of her maids to her father and informed him of
<>her desire. The sage readily agreed and had their
<>marriage performed. He also presented them 1,000
<>maids. After the ceremony, Yaya1ti returned to his
<>palace with his bride. S4armis2t2ha1 and the 2,000
<>maids also accompanied them. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapters 76-81).
<NI>3) {%Yaya1ti's domestic Life.%} After his arrival in his capital
<>city, Yaya1ti made arrangements for Devaya1ni1's residence
<>in his own palace while S4armis2t2ha1 took up her residence [Page897-a+ 65]
<>in As4okavanika1. In due course, Devaya1ni1 gave birth to
<>a son. The sight of the child roused the motherly inst-
<>incts of S4armis2t2ha1 who spent a thousand years in heart-
<>burning. One day, while she was brooding alone in her
<>garden, Yaya1ti happened to come there. As they met,
<>their hearts were moved by tender feelings. S4armis2t2ha1
<>approached Yaya1ti and begged for a son. But he tried
<>to evade her by pleading that it was not proper to do
<>anything in violation of Dharma. But in the end, he
<>had to yield to her earnest supplications and philosophical
<>arguments. Thus S4armis2t2ha1 conceived a son in secret.
<NI>When the child was born and it grew up, Devaya1ni1's
<>mind was constantly vexed with the thought as to who
<>was the father. Once in an angry mood she questioned
<>S4armis2t2ha1 herself about it. She answered that the
<>child's father was a sage whose identity she could not
<>ascertain in the excitement of her union with him. Any
<>way, this answer satisfied Devaya1ni1.
<NI>Soon after, another son was born to Devaya1ni1. The
<>first boy was named Yadu and the second son, Turvasu.
<>As a result of the secret relations between Yaya1ti and
<>S4armis2t2ha1, three boys were born to her and they were
<>named Druhyu, Anudruhyu and Pu1ru, respectively.
<>These boys also grew up in As4okavanika1.
<NI>Once Devaya1ni1 was in her garden with her husband
<>and children. Just then, S4armis2t2ha1's children also
<>happened to come there. Devaya1ni1 who somehow had
<>her own suspicions, enquired of them their parentage
<>and the innocent children replied that their mother was
<>S4armis2t2ha1 and their father was Yaya1ti. Devaya1ni1 who
<>became furious, immediately went to Asuraloka and
<>informed her father S4ukra about it. On hearing it, the
<>sage who was beside himself with anger owing to his
<>paternal affection, cursed Yaya1ti so that he fell a victim
<>to the infirmities of old age. Yaya1ti entreated S4ukra to
<>withdraw the curse since he had not enjoyed his youth
<>to the full.
<NI>S4ukra lifted the curse by assuring him that one of
<>Yaya1ti's sons would accept his father's old age in ex-
<>change for his youth and the son would be crowned
<>King after Yaya1ti. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 82 and
<>83).
<NI>4) {%Rejuvenation.%} Yaya1ti asked his eldest son Yadu for
<>his youthfulness. But the latter was not prepared to
<>exchange it for his father's old age. Next the father
<>approached his younger sons, Turvasu, Druhyu, and
<>Anudruhyu, with the same request, but all of them
<>in turn refused to oblige him. Even though Yaya1ti
<>promised to return the youthfulness to them after a
<>thousand years, they refused to exchange it for his old
<>age. Yaya1ti in his anger, cursed Yadu that his progeny
<>would never become Kings. Turvasu's family would be
<>completely destroyed and Druhyu would float down the
<>river, with unfulfilled desires and faded prosperity. Pu1ru
<>wholeheartedly accepted his father's old age in exchange
<>for his youth and went to the forest. From that day
<>Yaya1ti began his reign with a cheerful heart. (M.B.
<>A1di parva, Chapters 84 and 85).
<NI>In Padma Pura1n2a, there is a slightly different version
<>about the way in which Yaya1ti fell a victim to the in-
<>firmities of old age. It is as follows:--Seeing the rigorous
<>observance of Yaya1ti's virtuous life, Devendra began to
<>be alarmed at the thought that he might be dislodged
<>from his place. He called his charioteer Ma1tali and
<>ordered him to bring Yaya1ti with him to Indraloka. [Page897-b+ 65]
<>When Ma1tali failed in his mission, Devendra sent some
<>Gandharvas to enact the drama of “Va1mana1vata1ra”
<>before Yaya1ti. Enchanted by the charm and perform-
<>ance of Rati on the stage, the King became irresistibly
<>fascinated by the female sex.
<NI>Once the Ra1ks2asi1 named Jara1 and Madana got access
<>to Yaya1ti's body. While in that state, one day he went
<>to the forest for hunting. There he happened to meet
<>a beautiful girl named “As4rubindumati1”. From her
<>companion-maid, Vis4a1la1, the King came to know of her
<>history. Vis4a1la1 said to Yaya1ti--“Long ago when Ka1ma-
<>deva was burnt Rati was in deep grief. The gods were
<>moved to pity by her tears and they restored Ka1ma to
<>life. Rati who was extremely happy, began to shed
<>tears of joy. A beautiful girl was born from the tears
<>which fell from her left eye. This maid who is standing
<>before you is that girl. She is now looking for a suitable
<>person for her Svayam3vara.” On hearing this story the
<>King expressed his desire to marry her. As4rubindumati1
<>agreed to become his wife on condition that he exchang-
<>ed his old age with some young person for his youth-
<>fulness.
<NI>Yaya1ti returned to his palace and asked each of his sons
<>to give him his youth. Pu1ru alone fulfilled his father's
<>desire. After this Yaya1ti married As4rubindumati1. But he
<>was compelled to submit to another condition also, that
<>he should not maintain any contact with his other wives.
<>Devaya1ni1 and S4armis2t2ha1 naturally, became distressed
<>and furious when they saw Yaya1ti and As4rubindumati1
<>as husband and wife. So Yaya1ti asked Yadu to kill both
<>of them. But Yadu refused to obey him. Yaya1ti who
<>became angry at this, cursed his son that one of his
<>descendants would marry his uncle's daughter and
<>become heir to his mother's wealth.
<NI>After some time, on Menaka1's advice, As4rubindumati1
<>urged Yaya1ti to go on a visit to Heaven. So he entrust-
<>ed his kingdom to Pu1ru and went to Vaikun2t2ha.
<NI>5) {%Yaya1ti's reign.%} The Pura1n2as describe Yaya1ti as a
<>noble and eminent King. Some of the events which took
<>place during his reign and which deserve special praise,
<>are given below:
<NI>(i) {%Gift of cows.%} Once when King Yaya1ti was in the
<>company of his subjects, a Bra1hman2a approached him
<>with a request for Gurudaks2in2a1. At once Yaya1ti gave
<>him a gift of 1,000 cows. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>195).
<NI>(ii) {%Yaya1ti and Ga1lava.%} See para 6 under Ga1lava.
<NI>(iii) {%His end.%} After a thousand years, Yaya1ti handed
<>over his kingship to Pu1ru and went to the forest. He
<>spent many years living in Bhr2gutun3ga in the company
<>of sages, and feeding on fruits, roots, etc. and in the end
<>died in the forest and attained Heaven.
<NI>(iv) {%Yaya1ti's fall from Heaven.%} Yaya1ti remained in Heaven
<>for many years. Once he insulted the Devas, Indra and
<>other gods and kings in the divine assembly. The gods
<>looked at one another, wondering who this proud fellow
<>was. They asked how this man reached Heaven without
<>renouncing his pride. In the meantime Yaya1ti lost his
<>balance and fell down from Heaven to the earth. While
<>descending, he prayed that he should fall in the midst of
<>good men.
<NI>Just at this time, four kings named Pratardana, Vasu-
<>manas, S4ibi and As2t2aka were performing a Ya1ga in
<>Naimis2a1ran2ya. Yaya1ti happened to fall head down-
<>wards into their midst. But since they caught him in [Page898-a+ 64]
<>his fall he did not crash to the ground. He explained
<>his story to them. They allowed him to accept the
<>fruit of their Yajn5a and to go to Heaven. But since he
<>was a Ks2atriya he told them he had no right to it. Just
<>then, his daughter Ma1dhavi1 arrived there. She allowed
<>him to take half of the divine grace which she had earned
<>and with the help of it Yaya1ti ascended to Heaven
<>again. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 120).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Yaya1ti witnessed the battle between Kauravas and
<>Pa1n2d2avas which was fought as a result of the theft of
<>King Vira1t2a's cows. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56,
<>Verse 9).
<NI>(ii) In Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse
<>8, it is stated that King Yaya1ti continues to be in
<>Yama's assembly.
<NI>(iii) Yaya1ti once gave 1,000 cows to a Bra1hman2a as
<>“Gurudaks2in2a1”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 195).
<NI>(iv) He came riding in Indra's chariot and witnessed
<>the battle between Arjuna and Kr2pa1ca1rya, from the
<>sky. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 9).
<NI>(v) Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 115, men
<>tions that Yaya1ti had conducted 1,000 Ya1gas and that
<>he was the leader of all Kings.
<HI>YAYA1TIPATANA. A holy place. Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 48, mentions that a visit to
<>this place will give the same reward as an As4vamedha
<>Ya1ga.
<HI>YA1YA1VARA(S). A particular section of Brahmins.
<>Their special feature is that they wander about here
<>and there, following the course of life of the sages.
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 13, mentions that
<>the reputed sage Jaratka1ru was a Ya1ya1vara.
<HI>YODHYA. A country in ancient India. In Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 254, we read that this
<>country was conquered by Karn2a.
<HI>YOGA I. A sage who was the grandson of Sva1yambhuva
<>Manu and son of S4raddha1. Yoga was born to S4raddha1
<>by Dharma. (Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<HI>YOGA II. It is Jn5a1na that reveals Brahman. Yoga is the
<>concentration on Brahman. Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 372,
<>mentions that Yoga is the perfect union of Jiva1tma1 and
<>Parama1tma1.
<NI>In fact Yoga is activity with the body as its basis. It
<>may be doubted how a mere physical karman helps
<>Parabrahmada1rs4ana. But Mahars2is assert that there
<>is an inseparable connection between matter and soul.
<NI>Matter and soul are merely the two phases of the
<>single “Astitva”. The object of Yoga is to achieve
<>union with Parabrahman; in other words, to attain
<>Moks2a. The recitation of mantras is important in many
<>disciplines connected with the practice of Yoga. The
<>letters and words of mantras are so arranged that their
<>recitation in the proper manner produces profound and
<>favourable effects in the body. The habitual recitation
<>of mantras helps the practice of Yoga.
<NI>There are two broad divisions of Yoga--Hat2ha Yoga
<>and Ra1ja Yoga. The two are interconnected and have
<>to be practised simultaneously. Hat2ha Yoga is mainly
<>concerned with disciplining the body by various kinds
<>of exercises. Standing in Pan5ca1gni with the arms held
<>aloft; standing on one leg or standing on the head are
<>some of these exercises. Ra1ja Yoga aims at arousing
<>Prajn5a1 by control of the senses. [Page898-b+ 64]
<>Ra1ja Yoga involves the practice of eight disciplines.
<>They are:--Yama, Niyama, A1sana, Pra1n2a1ya1ma,
<>Pratya1ha1ra, Dha1ran2a1, Dhya1na and Sama1dhi. An
<>account of each of these is given below:--
<NI>i) {%Yama.%} Yama means refraining from evil courses or
<>sinful things like cruelty or dishonesty. Yama demands
<>the practice of Ahim3sa1, satya, asteya, brahmacarya and
<>aparigraha. (Ahim3sa1 = non-violence or not killing any
<>creature. Satya = truth; practising truth in thoughts,
<>words and deeds. Asteya = not stealing. Brahmacarya =
<>sexual continence. Aparigraha = not coveting wealth or
<>pleasures which are not absolutely necessary).
<NI>ii) {%Niyama.%} While Yama is a negative discipline,
<>Niyama is a positive one. It requires the positive practice
<>of virtuous courses. Niyama includes five things:--
<>S4auca (cleanliness), Santos2a (contentment), Tapas
<>(penance and austerities), Sva1dhya1ya (study of the
<>Vedas and incantations or mantras) and I1s4varapran2i-
<>dha1na (prayer and meditating on God). S4auca means
<>not only cleanliness of the body, but also of the mind.
<>The mind must be purged of all ‘malas’ like ka1ma,
<>krodha and lobha. Tapas means ability to endure
<>opposites (dvandvas) like heat and cold or joy and
<>sorrow. Sva1dhya1ya is “study of philosophical works.”
<>I1s4varapran2idha1na--dedicating all actions unto God.
<NI>iii) {%A1sana.%} The way of sitting or posture. Different
<>postures have been prescribed for different actions.
<>First of all, the yogi1 must choose a suitable place.
<NI>(The place must be level, neat, free from stones, fire or
<>gravel, agreeable to the mind and not causing irritation
<>to the eyes). (S4veta1s4vatara).
<NI>Different a1sanas like Padma1sana, Svastika1sana and
<>Siddha1sana have been prescribed for the practice of
<>Yoga.
<NI>Putting the left leg on the right thigh and the right leg
<>on the left thigh, holding the right toe with the left
<>hand and the left toe with the right hand, place the
<>chin on the chest and look at the tip of the nose. This
<>is Padma1sana.
<NI>Sitting upright with the feet tucked under the hips is
<>Svastika1sana.
<NI>Placing the left leg under the genitals, put the right
<>leg on it. Insert the chin into the pit of the throat;
<>control the senses; with steady eyes look at the point
<>between the eye-brows. This is Siddha1sana which will
<>break open the doors to Moks2a.
<NI>iv) {%Pra1n2a1ya1ma.%} This is regulation of breathing. Inhale
<>air through the left nostril, retain the air in the lungs
<>for a few minutes and then exhale it through the right
<>nostril. The process may be reversed--that is inhala-
<>tion through the right nostril and exhalation through
<>the left. This is the first step in Pra1n2a1ya1ma. Exhaling
<>the breath and then not inhaling for some time is
<>called recaka; the opposite process is called pu1raka.
<>The object of pra1n2a1ya1ma is to awaken Kun2d2alini1.
<NI>v) {%Pratya1ha1ra.%} This is a process of withdrawing the
<>five senses from the outer world. A man who practises
<>Pratya1ha1ra becomes oblivious of the outer world. This
<>helps the concentration of the mind on the A1tman.
<NI>vi) {%Dha1ran2a1.%} Withdrawing the mind from outer objects
<>and concentrating it on the self.
<NI>vii) {%Dhya1na.%} Meditation, concentrating the mind on
<>several places like Bhru1madhya and na1bhi1cakra. Re-
<>peating the sacred syllable OM is very useful in dhya1na. [Page899-a+ 65]
<NI>viii) {%Sama1dhi.%} In Sama1dhi the soul and mind unite,
<>the mind merging into the soul. Sama1dhi is defined
<>thus:--
<NI>When the mind and soul unite just as salt and water
<>unite, that state is called Sama1dhi.
<HI>YOGAMA1YA1DEVI1. The form of Devi1 in the state of
<>Yoga. It was Yogama1ya1devi1 who transferred the seventh
<>child of Devaki1 (Balabhadrara1ma) from her womb to
<>that of Rohin2i1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata 4th, Skandha).
<HI>YOGAVATI1. Third daughter of Mena1. She was the
<>wife of the sage Jaigi1s2avya. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i
<>Khan2d2a).
<HI>YOGI1S4VARA(S). A community of famous yogins.
<>Kavi, Hari, Antariks2a, Prabuddha, Pippala1yana, A1vir-
<>hotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhojana belonged to
<>this community. They were the sons of the sage R2s2a-
<>bha and used to go about naked, everywhere. This
<>community of yogins participated in the yajn5a of Nimi,
<>King of Mithila1 and gave him advice on Bha1gavata-
<>dharma. (Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).

<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 20, which mentions
<>that the Pa1n2d2avas had sent an invitation to this King
<>to take part in the war.
<HI>YUDDHA (WAR). (i) In ancient times in India war
<>was considered a “Ra1jadharma”. A war declared
<>under this law was known as “Dharmayuddha”
<NI>(ii) It is forbidden to use a weapon describing it falsely
<>as another weapon. The use of arrows heated in fire, is
<>also against Dharmayuddha.
<NI>(iii) It is also against the rules of Dharmayuddha to
<>kill a person who gets down from the chariot, a eunuch,
<>one with joined palms, one who squats on the ground,
<>one who seeks refuge, one who is asleep, one who is
<>naked, an unarmed person, one who has come to wit-
<>ness the fight, one who is fighting with another, one
<>whose weapon is broken, one who is bereaved by the
<>death of a son or other relative, one who is vanquished,
<>one who flees from battle, and one who refuses to attack
<>in return etc.
<NI>(iv) If a warrior fleeing from battlefield is killed by his
<>enemy, he carries with him his master's sins.
<NI>(v) All the grace earned by the young man who flees
<>from battle, passes to his master.

<>battle except chariots, horses, elephants, umbrellas,
<>wealth, corn, cows, women, weapons, silver and gold.

<>came hostile and they separated. At last Yudha1jit exiled
<>Sudars4ana from his country and crowned his own
<>brother, S4atrujit as King of Ayodhya1. (See under
<>Dhruvasandhi).
<HI>YUDHA1JITA. A Ya1dava King. In Padma Pura1n2a,

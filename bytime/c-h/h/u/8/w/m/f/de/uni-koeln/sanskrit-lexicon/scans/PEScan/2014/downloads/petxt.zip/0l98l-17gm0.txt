<HI>BRAHMA1:
<NI>One of the trimu1rtis of the Hindu Pantheon. The tri-
<>mu1rtis are Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God who is the creator of the
<>Universe. It is mentioned in the Pura1n2as that Brahma1
<>creates, Vis2n2u preserves and Paramas4iva destroys the
<>universe.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Brahma1.%} The birth of Brahma1 is from
<>the nave of Vis2n2u. It is mentioned in Devi1 Pura1n2a,
<>Skandha 1, about the birth of Brahma1 as follows:--
<>In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u lay on a banian leaf in the
<>shape of a baby and began to think, “Who am I? Who
<>created me? What for? What is my work? Where to
<>work?” and so on. At that time an ethereal voice said:--
<>“Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham3 na1nyadasti sana1ta-
<>nam”.
<F>*) Idam3 sarvam3 khalu aham eva, Sana1tanam anyad na1sti. All these are myself. Except me there is nothing eternal.</F> Maha1vis2n2u was amazed at this ethereal
<>voice. He did not know whose oracle it was. Still He
<>lay meditating upon the words. Then Maha1devi1,
<>with four hands and weapons such as S4an3kha (conch),
<>Cakra (wheel), Gada1 (club), Padma (lotus) and
<>maids who are prosperities and having worn glorious
<>clothes and ornaments, and accompanied by the S4aktis [Page147-b+ 63]
<>(powers) named Rati, Bhu1ti, Buddhi, Mati, Ki1rti,
<>Dhr2ti, Smr2ti, S4raddha1, Medha1, Svadha1, Sva1ha1, Ks2udha1,
<>Nidra1, Daya1, Gati1, Tus2t2i, Pus2t2i, Ks2ama1, Lajja1, Jr2m3bha1
<>and Tandra1, appeared before Maha1vis2n2u, who was
<>struck with wonder. Maha1devi1 said, “Oh, Vis2n2u, what
<>is there to wonder at? Every time the universe is sub-
<>jected to creation, preservation and destruction, you
<>are born thus due to the great power of the supreme
<>spirit. It seems that you have forgotten those matters.
<>Know that the supreme power is beyond qualities. We
<>are all with qualities. Your main quality is Sattva.
<>From your nave Brahma1 will be born. His attribute is
<>Rajogun2a (activity, passion or motion). From the middle
<>of the eyebrows of Brahma1, will be born Rudra, whose
<>attribute will be Ta1masagun2a (darkness). Brahma1,
<>with the power of penance, will acquire the ability of
<>creation and by his attribute of Rajogun2a will create
<>the world in the colour of blood. You will be the preserver
<>of that world. The same world will be destroyed by
<>Rudra at the end of the Kalpa (world age)”.
<NI>Accordingly from the nave of Vis2n2u a lotus grew up and
<>in that lotus flower Brahma1 took his form. The same
<>Brahmadeva did penance before Maha1vis2n2u and Jaga-
<>damba1, who were pleased at his penance and gave him
<>all the boons he wanted. After that Brahma1 began the
<>work of creation. He created with his mind the Saptars2is,
<>(seven sages) and then the Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). From them all the movables and the
<>immovables in the universe came into existence. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>In manusmr2ti, Chapter 1, the following stanza about the
<>creation of Brahma1 occurs.
<Poem>“Tadan2d2amabhavad haimam
<>Sahasra1m3s4usamaprabham3 /
<>Tasmin jajn5e svayam3 Brahma1
<>Sarvalokapita1mahah2” //</Poem>
<NI>That egg was as radiant as the Sun, with the colour of
<>gold. Brahma1 the great grandfather of everything in the
<>world took birth by himself in it.
<NI>From the supreme power, an egg fell on the water which
<>was the first creation. That egg became a germ of golden
<>colour. Creating a life, which had done penance in its
<>former births in such a way as to enable it to become
<>Brahma1, in the golden germ of the egg, the supreme power
<>entered the life that is to become Brahma1 as its inner
<>guide. That Brahma1 is known as the Pita1maha (Grand-
<>father of the manes) or Paternal grandfather of all the
<>worlds.”
<NI>Va1manapura1n2a Chapter 43 states as follows about the
<>creation of Brahma1:--
<NI>Ages before the beginning, when all the worlds with
<>everything they contained were submerged in the single
<>ocean of the great flood, the germ of living things formed
<>itself into a big egg. Brahma1 who had been inside the
<>egg went to a long sleep. The sleep continued for a
<>thousand yugas (ages) when Brahma1 woke up; as
<>Sattva gun2a (purity) was the foremost attribute of him,
<>he saw that the world was void. When the thought of
<>creation occurred in his mind Rajogun2a (activity or
<>passion) became his foremost attribute. Rajas is the
<>attribute that creates and Sattva, that which preserves.
<>At the time of destruction Tamogun2a (darkness) be-
<>comes the foremost attribute. That Bhagava1n (Supreme [Page148-a+ 64]
<>Spirit) the Purus2a (the Male creative Energy) pervades
<>over everything, in all the living worlds. That Eternal
<>Being is Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva.
<NI>Knowing that the world was lying in pure water, the
<>Bhagava1n (Supreme Being) cut the egg open. From it the
<>Om3ka1ra (the sacred syllable ‘Om’) emanated. The
<>first sound of it was ‘Bhu1h2’, the second, sound, ‘Bhuvah2’
<>and the third sound ‘Svah2’. So they came to be known
<>as “Bhu1rbhuvah2 Svah2”. Then the glorious radiance of
<>the sun was born from it and Brahma1 the grandfather of
<>the worlds originated in the centre of the egg.
<NI>3) {%Instigation to compose Ra1ma1yan2a.%} It was Brahma1 who
<>instigated Va1lmi1ki to compose the Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>A fowler of the forest tribe shot down one of a couple of
<>snipes which were carrying on love-making, on the banks
<>of the River Tamasa1. Seeing this Va1lmi1ki cursed the
<>fowler. The curse came out of the mouth of Va1lmi1ki
<>in the form of a verse,
<F>1) You forester, your life will not continue for many years since you have killed one of the couple of snipes.</F> “ma1 nis2a1da pratis2t2ha1m tvama-
<>gamah2 s4a1s4vati1h2 sama1h2, yat kraun5camithuna1dekam,
<>avadhi1h2 ka1mamohitam,” which according to hearsay,
<>is the first piece of poetry in the world. Brahma1 who
<>was attracted by the poetry came to the hermitage of
<>Va1lmi1ki and instigated him to compose the story of
<>Ra1ma in verse. It is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 2, that the Ra1ma1yan2a was composed
<>thus.
<NI>4) {%Ra1van2a is given a boon.%} It was Brahma1 who made
<>Ra1van2a an ever-powerful hero. Penance was done by
<>Ra1van2a in the vicinity of the Hima1layas and Brahma1
<>appeared before him and granted him the boon that no
<>living creature except man, would kill him. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 16).
<NI>5) {%The loss of a head.%} Long ago S4iva plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. This story occurs in various pura1n2as with
<>slight changes. Two of them are given below:--
<NI>(1) In olden days, in the period of Satyayuga, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u did penance in S4vetadvi1pa (the island S4veta)
<>to obtain Eternal Bliss, being deeply engaged in the study
<>of Brahmavidya1. Brahma1 also went to another place
<>and began to do penance for the suppression of passions.
<>Both were doing severe penance. So they began to
<>walk in order to take rest from the penance. On the way
<>they met each other. One asked “who are you?” The
<>other also asked the same question. The talk ended in a
<>contest as to who was the greater of the two. Each
<>claimed himself to be the supreme power of the world.
<>Neither of them was prepared to recognize the claims
<>of the other. In the midst of this contest, a phallus,
<>extra-ordinarily bulky and fair appeared before them and
<>an ethereal voice said from the sky: “You need not
<>quarrel as to who is superior. He who reaches the extre-
<>mity of this phallus is the superior person. So both of
<>you proceed, one upwards and the other downwards
<>and find out the end.” Hearing this Vis2n2u went down-
<>wards to find out the bottom and Brahma1, upwards to
<>the top. Vis2n2u travelled for a long time and finding no
<>end thought the attempt futile and returned to the start-
<>ing point with disappointment and sat down.
<NI>Brahma1 travelled upwards for a long time and found no
<>end. On the way he saw the petal of a pan2d2a1nus flower,
<>coming down from the sky. Brahma1 took it and joyfully
<>returned and said haughtily to Vis2n2u: “See, I have
<>taken this flower from the head of the Phallus. I have [Page148-b+ 63]
<>brought this to convince you. You have been defeated.
<>So can you not admit that I am the superior?”
<>Maha1vis2n2u did not believe the words of Brahma1. So he
<>called the Pan2d2a1nus flower to him and questioned it.
<>The Pan2d2a1nus flower took false oath and witnessed in
<>favour of Brahma1, who had asked the flower before-
<>hand to be on his side. Maha1vis2n2u did not believe
<>this either and said, “Let S4iva be witness to this flower”.
<>S4iva at these words appeared before them and revealed
<>the deceit played by Brahma1 and the flower and then
<>cursed the Pan2d2a1nus flower that thenceforward it
<>should not have a place among the flowers of oblation
<>to S4iva. Then S4iva got angry and plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. That is the skull S4iva uses for receiving
<>alms. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, S4kandha 5.)
<NI>(2) In days of old all the worlds with everything in them
<>were under water in a single ocean. The Sun, the
<>Moon, the Stars, air, fire, everything was destroyed. A
<>day of utter darkness appeared. Grass, bush all were
<>destroyed. Nothing could be seen and recognized. All
<>existents and non-existents were destroyed. Bhagava1n,
<>(Supreme Being) was sleeping continuously for so many
<>thousands of nights. At the end of the night Bhagava1n
<>assumed the attribute of Rajas (Activity) and got ready
<>for the work of creation. He, the knower of all Vedas
<>and Veda1n3gas appeared in the shape of a wonderful be-
<>ing with five faces. Another being with three eyes, matted
<>hair, a trident in one hand, and a garland of beads in the
<>other, and with darkness as its attribute took shape. That
<>being was called Purus2a (the male creative energy).
<>Then the Maha1tma1 (the Supreme Spirit) created Aham3-
<>ka1ra (Egoism). It affected Brahma1 and S4iva. Overcome
<>by egoism, S4iva said to Brahma1:--“Who are you? Who
<>created you?” Swelled with egoism Brahma1 asked in
<>reply:--“Who are you? Who are your parents? Let
<>me hear it.” This talk ended in a quarrel. The origin of
<>Bhagava1n (the Lord) was from this quarrel. Immedi-
<>ately after his birth the Lord took an unparralleled lute
<>and playing it, went up to the sky. S4iva being defeated
<>by Brahma1, bowed his head and coloured. While Para-
<>mes4vara was standing angrily thus, the fifth face told
<>him, “You, who are having three eyes and whose attri-
<>bute is darkness! look here! I will tell you all. You, who
<>wear air as garments, and ride on an ox, are the destroyer
<>of the world.” Hearing these words S4iva grew more and
<>more angry, opened his third eye and looked steadily
<>at Brahma1 to burn him. Seeing the faces shining like the
<>Sun Brahma1 said, “When you beat on water, bubbles will
<>appear. But do they have any prowess? Hearing this,
<>S4iva plucked off the head of Brahma1 with the tip of his
<>finger nails. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>5) {%Changing Vijayalaks2mi1 to Lan3ka1laks2mi1, by curse.%} Vijaya-
<>laks2mi1, one of the eight Laks2mi1s, was the treasury-
<>keeper of Brahma1. Once she became careless in dis-
<>charging her duties. Brahma1 got angry and cursed her.
<>“You go to Ra1van2a and keep his tower”. She humbly
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Brahma1 said,
<>“At the time of the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma, a monkey-
<>hero named Hanuma1n will reach Lan3ka1 in search of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma's wife, whom Ra1van2a had kidnapped. You will
<>obstruct him, and he will strike you down. On that day
<>you will be absolved from the curse and you will return
<>here instantly.” Accordingly Vijayalaks2mi1 was born in [Page149-a+ 64]
<>Lan3ka1 under the name Lan3ka1laks2mi1. When Hanuma1n
<>jumped to Lan3ka1 she prevented him, and he struck her
<>down to the ground. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Brahma1 cursing the daughters of Himava1n.%} Three dau-
<>ghters named Kut2ila1, Ra1gin2i1 and Pa1rvati1 and a son
<>named Suna1bha were born to Himava1n by his wife
<>Mena1. The three daughters went to the Hima1layas for
<>penance, to get S4iva as husband. They were not even
<>six years old then. The devas saw them. The A1dityas
<>and the Vasus took Kut2ila1 who was doing penance, to
<>the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together
<>and asked Brahma1. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if
<>this girl will be able to bear a son who could kill Mahis2a1-
<>sura”. Brahma1 replied. “This poor girl will not be
<>capable of bearing the radiance of S4iva. So let her go
<>away.” Kut2ila1 got angry at Brahma1 and said “Lord,
<>I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of
<>S4iva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please
<>Vis2n2u and make S4iva bow his head. I take a vow to
<>that effect.” Brahma1 became angry and told Kut2ila1,
<>“You, wicked Kut2ila1, you did not succumb to my words.
<>So by my curse you will be turned to water.”
<NI>Kut2ila1 having been cursed by Brahma1 became water
<>and began to flood the world of Brahma1. Seeing the flow
<>of water, Brahma1 made cause-ways on four sides with the
<>Vedas of R2g, Yajus, Sa1ma and Atharva. Thus being
<>tied up she stays in the world of Brahma1.
<NI>The Devas took Ra1gin2i1 also before Brahma1 and put the
<>same question. The reply of Brahma1 was the same as
<>before. She also got angry and said to Brahma1. “I will
<>do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in
<>my family to be the killer of Mahis2a1sura.” Brahma1
<>cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my
<>words which even devas won't gainsay. So you will be-
<>come the colours of the twilight.” Thus she became the
<>fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divid-
<>ed among the Pleiades. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>51).
<NI>7) {%Giving a boon to a tiger and golden colour to Pa1rvati1.%} The
<>first name of Pa1rvati1, the daughter of Himava1n was Ka1li1.
<>She was given this name (Ka1li1) because of her dark
<>complexion. After the marriage S4iva and Pa1rvati1 led a
<>household life in the golden house built by Vis4vakarma1.
<>Once S4iva called Devi1 humorously, by the name Ka1li1.
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and said to her husband. “A wound by
<>an arrow will be cured. If you cut down a tree by an
<>axe it will sprout again. A wound inflicted by hard
<>words will never be cured. The arrows of words shoot
<>out of the mouth. Those who are hit by them suffer
<>pain day and night. Wise people should not shoot them
<>at others. You have violated that principle. So my lord,
<>I am going to do intensive penance. I will endeavour to
<>create such a condition, that you may not call me by the
<>name Ka1li1 again.” Saying thus, Pa1rvati1 bowed before
<>Parames4vara and bidding good-bye she went up into the
<>air and reached the peak of Hima1layas and thought of
<>Jaya1, Vijaya1, Jayanti1 and Apara1jita1. Instantly they
<>arrived to see Ka1li1. They got permission and stayed with
<>Pa1rvati1 to attend on her.
<NI>While Pa1rvati1 was engaged in doing penance, a tiger,
<>with his weapons of tusks and claws came there from the
<>jungles of the Hima1layas. Uma1 (Pa1rvati1) was standing
<>on one leg. The tiger began to think, “I shall do it when [Page149-b+ 65]
<>it is needed”. Thinking thus it gazed at the face of Devi1
<>with staring eyes and consequently it lost one eye.
<NI>Pronouncing the word Brahma1 Devi1 did penance for a
<>hundred years. After that Brahma1, the Lord of the three
<>worlds appeared before her and said to her: “I am much
<>pleased. Your penance was flawless. Ask your boon.”
<>Ka1li1 replied, “Oh, Lotus-born! First give this tiger a
<>boon. It will please me.” Then Brahma1 gave the wonder-
<>ful tiger leadership of the Gan2as, devotion to S4iva, invin-
<>cibility and righteousness. After giving the tiger this boon
<>Brahma1 told Pa1rvati1, “Now, Ambika1, ask your boon.
<>Don't hesitate, I will grant the boon.” Then Pa1rvati1
<>asked the boon. “Brahma1, give me golden colour”.
<>Brahma1 said “Let it be so”, and disappeared. The
<>dark complexion of Pa1rvati1 disappeared. She got the
<>colour of the filament of the lotus flower. From the dis-
<>carded skin Ka1tya1yani1 was born. Then Indra appeared
<>and asked for her as a gift. Indra requested Pa1rvati1 on
<>behalf of heaven. “Let me have her. Let this Kaus4iki1
<>be my sister. Because she was born from your Kos4a,
<>(outer skin) she is Kaus4iki1, I am also Kaus4ika.” Devi1
<>gave the beautiful Kaus4iki1 to Indra. Sahasra1ks2a (Indra
<>who has thousand eyes) took her to the Vindhya moun-
<>tain; when they reached there Indra told her. “You stay
<>on this mount, honoured and revered by gods. You will
<>be known as Vindhyava1sini1 (who stays on the Vindhya).
<>He consecrated the goddess there. She was given a lion
<>as her carrier (Va1hana) “You destroy the asuras?”
<>saying so Indra returned to Heaven. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 54).
<NI>8) {%Brahma1 became river.%} Long ago in the period of
<>Ca1ks2us2a manvantara (the age of a Manu), Brahma1
<>decided to perform a sacrifice on the Sahya Mountain
<>and preparations were made for it. Brahma1 came with
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva. Bhr2gu and the other hermits took their
<>seats. Maha1vis2n2u called Svara1devi1, the wife of Brahma1.
<>But she was very slow in coming. The hermit Bhr2gu
<>said to Vis2n2u: “You yourself have gone to call Devi1.
<>But she is very slow. The auspicious moment is coming
<>to an end. So how are we to commence the rituals?”
<>“If Svara1 does not appear before the end of the stipulated
<>time we shall seat Ga1yatri1 in her place,” said Vis2n2u.
<>S4iva also agreed to it. So Bhr2gu seated Ga1yatri1 on the
<>right side of Brahma1 and the rituals were performed. By
<>then Svara1 reached the sacrificial hall. When she saw
<>that Ga1yatri was placed in her place and the rituals were
<>performed she became angry, because of her quarrel
<>with her co-wife. She called out: “Where the person to
<>whom respect is due, is not given respect and where the
<>person who ought not to be respected is given undue
<>respect, there, scarcity, death and fear will be rampant.
<>She dared to sit on the right in my place. So she will
<>grow lean and become a river which will not be seen in
<>the world. All of you will become rivers because you have
<>placed a person lower than me in my position.” Hearing
<>the curse of Svara1, Ga1yatri1 rose up trembling, and cursed
<>Svara1 also to become a river. Before Svara1 was changed
<>to a river, Brahma1 and the other gods rose up and
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Svara1 said,
<>“Gods, it is because you have not given oblations to
<>Gan2apati in the beginning of the sacrifice, that this
<>break, due to my anger, has been caused. My curse
<>cannot be futile. So each of you change to a river by
<>your portions and we, your wives, will also become rivers
<>by our portions, and flow to the west.” [Page150-a+ 65]
<NI>Thus Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara became rivers
<>with their portions. Brahma1 became the fast-flowing
<>Kukudmati1, Maha1vis2n2u changed to river Kr2s2n2a1 and
<>S4iva, the river Ven2i1. The devas also changed their
<>portions to rivers and flowed from the Sahya mountain
<>to the east and their wives changed to rivers by their
<>portions and flowed to the west. Svara1 and Ga1yatri1
<>flowed as two rivers to the west and then joined together
<>as one river called Sa1vitri1. Vis2n2u and S4iva who were
<>consecrated at the sacrifice by Brahma1 came to be called
<>Bala and Atibala (Powerful and more powerful). This is
<>the origin of the rivers in Kerala. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 113).
<NI>9) {%Brahma1 is not worshipped.%} Long ago Brahma1 and
<>Vis2n2u went to see S4iva near Himava1n. They saw a shin-
<>ing phallus there in front of them. It was of immense
<>size. One of them went downwards and the other
<>upwards to find out the end of it. Both returned without
<>reaching the top or the bottom and by penance they
<>pleased S4iva who appeared before them and asked them
<>what boon they desired. Brahma1 asked S4iva to take
<>birth as his son. S4iva did not like this and said that no-
<>body would worship Brahma1 because of his extravagant
<>desire (namely, to have S4iva as his son). Vis2n2u requested
<>that he should be made a servant at S4iva's feet. So
<>Vis2n2u incarnated as S4iva's S4akti (power). That S4akti is
<>Pa1rvati1. So Vis2n2u and Pa1rvati1 are one and the same in a
<>sense. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2halambakam3, Ta-
<>ran3ga 1).
<NI>10) {%The abode of Brahma1.%} It is said in Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 8, that the abode of Brahma1 is on the top of
<>Mount Maha1meru. There are nine towns there. Mano-
<>vati1 which is in the centre, is the town of Brahma1. Due
<>east of Manovati1 stands Amara1vati1, the town of Indra.
<>On the south-east corner there is Rajovati1 which is owned
<>by Agni (fire-god). Due south of Brahmapuri1 there is
<>the town of Sam3yamani1 which is the town of Yama (God
<>of death) On the south west corner there is the town of
<>Nirr2ti. It is named Kr2s2n2a1n5jana1. On the west there is
<>the town called S4raddha1vati1. It is the abode of God
<>Varun2a. On the north-west corner there is the town
<>called Gandhavati1 which is the abode of Bhagava1n
<>Va1yu (Wind-God). Due north to Brahmapuri1 stands the
<>town of Kubera (God of wealth). It is known by the
<>name Mahodaya. On the north east corner there is the
<>city of S4iva. It is known as Yas4ovati1.
<NI>11) {%The sons of Brahma1.%} Brahma1 is the creator of all
<>the living things in the world. Still mention is made in the
<>Pura1n2as about countless divine persons who were born
<>from the mind and body of Brahma1, directly and indi-
<>rectly. They are given below in groups.
<NI>(1) Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
<>It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 10, that these six grand hermits were born
<>from the mind of Brahma1.
<NI>(2) Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 51 that these
<>two were good sons born to Brahma1.
<NI>(3) Rudra. Mention is made in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>20, that Brahma1 had a roaring son who was named
<>Rudra.
<NI>(4) Sva1yam3bhuva Manu. It occurs in Bha1gavata
<>Skandha 11, that Manu Sva1yam3bhuva was the son of
<>Brahma1.
<NI>(5) Kandarpa (Ka1madeva--Cupid). In Katha1sarit- [Page150-b+ 64]
<>sa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3baka, Taran3ga, 6, it is mentioned
<>that Cupid was born from the Egoism of Brahma1.
<NI>(6) Madhuka and Golika1. In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a, men-
<>tion is made that from the playful habit of Brahma1, a
<>giant named Madhuka and a giantess named Golika1
<>were born.
<NI>(7) Bhr2gu. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanza 8, that the hermit Bhr2gu was the son
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>(8) Ja1m3bava1n. It is seen in Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a that
<>Ja1m3bava1n was born from the sweat of Brahma1.
<NI>(9) The Sanakas. In Bha1gavata mention is made that
<>the Sanakas (Sanaka, Sananda, Sana1tana and Sanat-
<>kuma1ra) were sons of Brahma1.
<NI>(10) In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva there is a
<>passage given as the words of Vasis2t2ha spoken to Bhr2gu,
<>about the birth of many of the sons of Brahma1. “May
<>I tell you a story I have heard long ago about the revela-
<>tion of Brahma1 of himself?
<NI>Lord Rudra took the form of Varun2a and performed a
<>sacrifice. Many hermits, all the devas, Agni and others,
<>Vas2at2k ra (Exclamation in sacrifice) which took body,
<>and all yajn5a1n3gas came to the sacrificial hall. All the
<>expedients, all the glories which are thousands in number
<>took shape and came to the sacrifice. R2gveda arrayed
<>in garments of heroism came there. All the omens, all
<>the voices, all the emotions, all the etymologies of pro-
<>nouncing Veda Su1ktas, all the svarabhaktikas, Om3ka1ra
<>(the syllable Om3) the eye of all the Vedic metres and
<>their theories, all restraints and donations, all Vedas,
<>Upanis2ads, accomplishments, Sa1vitri1, the past, the near
<>future and distant future, all these came there. The
<>Lord S4iva held everyone of them. He offered his spirit
<>by his spirit. The sacrifice took many forms and shed
<>radiances. Paramas4iva is heaven, is the sky, is the earth,
<>is the ether and the husband of the Earth, is the lord
<>of all accomplishments, is noble and the lord of radiance.
<>This Lord is lauded by the names Brahma1, S4iva, Rudra,
<>Varun2a, Agni, and Prabha1vati1. S4iva is the King of all
<>the worlds. Penances, sacrifices, vows emblazed by fast,
<>all the directions and gods of directions, Indras, celestial
<>maids, mothers of the worlds, all these assumed forms
<>and came to the sacrifice in multitudes. Everybody who
<>witnessed the sacrifice of Parames4vara, who was in the
<>form of Varun2a, was greatly pleased. Seeing the pleased
<>celestial maids standing in rows passion arose in Brahma1.
<>He had seminal discharge. A1ditya (the Sun) took the
<>earth on which the semen fell and threw it into the sacri-
<>ficial fire, which blazed furiously. Brahma1 who became
<>the offerer of oblation had discharge again. He got it in
<>the sacrificial ladle and with recitation of spells offered
<>it in the sacrificial fire as if it was ghee. The powerful
<>semen contained the three attributes of Sattva, Rajas
<>and Tamas. From the attribute of Rajas arose the
<>living world which had activity as its purpose. Radiance
<>is the quality of Sattva which entered the living and non-
<>living world. It gives light to everything. It also gives
<>the power of discrimination. From the semen offered
<>in the fire, three sons with body and the attributes of
<>demi-gods came out. The male who had originated from
<>the flame called ‘Bharjana’ became An3giras. The male
<>who originated from the burning coals became Kavi.
<>Over and above these three radiances, other radiances
<>also originated from the sacrificial fire. From the Mari1cis [Page151-a+ 65]
<>(rays) of the fire Mari1ci the father of Kas4yapa was born.
<>From the Kus4a-grass spread on the floor of the hall of
<>sacrifice, the Ba1lakhilyas were born. Atri also was
<>born from the Kus4a-grass. The noble hermits called
<>Vaikha1nasas, who have grown powerful by penance and
<>became the seat of all good qualities, were born from
<>the sacrificial ashes. From the stream of fire which are
<>the eyes of the sacrificial fire the handsome As4vins
<>were born. The rest of the Praja1patis were born from
<>the ears of the fire. From the pores of the skin of fire
<>were born the hermits, from the sweat the ‘chandas’
<>(metre of Vedas) and from might, the mind. For this
<>reason the Vedic scholars and knowers of the S4ruti and
<>those who see the superiority of Vedas, say that fire is a
<>combination of all the gods. The trees that feed the fire
<>are called Ma1sas (months), the sap of the tree is called
<>Paks2a (half of the month i.e. full moon to new moon and
<>new moon to full moon), the pith of the tree is called
<>night and day and the flames are called Muhu1rtas
<>(auspicious moments). Rudras were born from the
<>blood of fire and the golden coloured gods, the Maitras,
<>also were born from the blood of fire. From the smoke
<>of the fire, the Vasus, from the flame of the fire Rudras
<>and the A1dityas of the extreme radiance were born.
<>The planets and stars which stand in their places in
<>the sky are the charcoal of the fire. Brahma1 declared that
<>fire was Brahma1 the supreme spirit, eternal and the
<>giver of all wishes. The sinless Maha1deva, who was in
<>the form of Varun2a said, “This sacrificial fire is mine,
<>and I am the sacrificer. So the children born as the first
<>fruit of this sacrifice are mine. So Bhr2gu, An3giras and
<>Kavi are my sons, no doubt. Let everybody who moves
<>along the sky know that these three are my sons, the
<>fruit of my sacrifice.” Agni said, “These are born from
<>my organs. They had been depending on me for their
<>sustenance. So they are my sons.” Brahma1 the teacher
<>of all the worlds and the grandfather of all living beings
<>said, “They are my sons. I offered my sperm to the fire,
<>and these sons were born therefrom, How can they be
<>claimed by anybody else? Here, I am the utterer of the
<>spell and the offerer of the sperm. I am the owner of
<>the sperm. Am I not the owner of the fruit? There is no
<>contest on the point that the birth of Bhr2gu and others is
<>from the oblation of my sperm.” The Gods who heard
<>these arguments bowed their heads before Brahma1 and
<>greeting him said, “Lord Brahma1, It is not only us that
<>are born from you, but the entire world of living and
<>non-living is born from you. So let Agni and Deva in
<>the shape of Varun2a have their wishes.”
<NI>12) {%Brahma1 and the giantess Karkkat2i1.%} In days of old, a
<>ferocious giantess named Karkkat2i1 lived on the northern
<>side of the Hima1layas. Because of the hugeness of her
<>body and the scarcity of food she became famished. She
<>began to do penance for the alleviation of her hunger
<>and thirst. She stood on one leg in the Hima1laya Moun-
<>tain, fixing her eyes on the sun in the day and on the
<>Moon in the night, and the severe penance continued
<>for a thousand years. Then Brahma1 appeared before her
<>and told her that she could ask for any boon. She said
<>“I wish to become a Su1ci1 (Needle) as hard as iron, hav-
<>ing the form of disease. This is the boon I pray for,
<>Brahma1”. Brahma1 blessed her and said, “Let it be so,
<>my daughter, you shall be a su1cika1 (needle) with the
<>prefix ‘V’ that is Vis4u1cika1 (Spasmodic cholera) You
<>can eat those who eat stale food, those who are wicked, [Page151-b+ 65]
<>those who sit in places where they ought not to sit and
<>those who are hard-hearted. Enter into their bodies and
<>affect their hearts, spleens and life-breaths. Thus carry
<>out the work of destruction? You can affect both the
<>good and the bad. But good people should not be killed.
<>So to save them from death, you can use this mantra
<>(spell).
<NI>“om3, hra1m3, hri1m3, s4ri1m3, s4a1m3, vis2n2us4aktaye, namah2;
<>bhagavati vis2n2us4akti ehi, ena1m3 hara hara: dehe hana

<>daya: du1re kuru kuru sva1ha1--vis2u1cike! tvam3 hima-
<>vantam3 gaccha? ji1vasarah2 candraman2d2alam3 gata1si
<>sva1ha1.”
<NI>Saying these words Brahma1 disappeared. Karkkat2i1 made
<>her body smaller and smaller and finally assumed the
<>shape of a needle. After that she began her work by
<>entering the body of those who had lost their energy
<>because of illness, in the form of a needle of gout and
<>caused Cholera, and the body of those who were lean
<>and worn and weary, in the form of internal cholera.
<>Thus assuming two bodies and killing countless people
<>she travelled for a long time in the earth and the sky,
<>until she herself felt aversion to her work. When she
<>remembered her original form she loathed the needle-
<>form. Karkkat2i1 again went to the vicinity of the Hima1-
<>layas and began to do penance, which lasted for another
<>thousand years. Thus she became pure and by the
<>power of thinking, she acquired spiritual knowledge.
<>Then she wanted to be saved from the mirage of birth
<>and death, to attain which, she did penance for yet
<>another thousand years at the end of which, the highly
<>pleased Brahma1 appeared before her and said, “daugh-
<>ter Karkkat2i1, all the darkness is erased from your heart
<>and you have attained deliverance from delusion. Now
<>I will bless you according to your wish. Receive your
<>original body and walk about in the worlds eating the
<>ignorant, bad beginners, the imprudent, those who sit in
<>bad places and dwell in bad places.”
<NI>She became a giantess again, but as she had attained
<>purity of soul, she engaged herself in deep meditation
<>which was free from doubt. The meditation lasted for a
<>long time. Finally her mind waved. Then she remem-
<>bered about worldly things and felt hunger. She remem-
<>bered, “Brahma1 has ordained the wicked as my food.
<>So I shall seek them.” Thinking thus she went to a jungle
<>in the vicinity of the Hima1layas. That was the dwelling
<>place of foresters. In that dark night the King and the
<>minister of the foresters approached the place where
<>Karkkat2i1 sat. Karkkat2i1 seeing them thought, “let me
<>know first if they are good or bad.” So she decided to
<>ask them some questions.
<NI>She asked them in a voice like thunder. “Who are you?
<>Are you enlightened sages or ignorant fools? say quickly.”
<>The king of the foresters hearing this replied in a cynical
<>way. “You insignificant ghost? What is your form?
<>Where do you sit? Let us see your powerless body. Who
<>is there to fear at your sound which is like the humming
<>of a she-beetle?”
<NI>Hearing this reply Karkkat2i1 showed her tusks and lau-
<>ghed loud, to spread light, and to terrify them. They
<>heard the loud roaring sound of her laugh and saw her
<>huge form in the light. But those mighty heroes were
<>not at all shaken by the sound they heard or the sight
<>they witnessed. The Minister looked at her and said,
<>“Hei, Giantess? These delusions of yours will have no [Page152-a+ 65]
<>effect on us. Even if a number of mosquitoes like you
<>come before us, they will be only dry leaves before wind.
<>You are acting like this merely for food. So what is
<>your need? Tell us, we will satisfy you”.
<NI>Hearing the words of the minister Karkkat2i1 knew that
<>her might was useless before such valiant men. She
<>thought them to be sages. So she said “Hey mighty
<>heroes. Who are you? Tell me the truth”. The minister
<>said: “This the King of foresters and I am his minister.
<>We came for a night-walk to find out and punish wicked
<>people like you.”
<NI>The giantess appreciated them and said: “I am about to
<>put some questions to you. If you give me suitable ans-
<>wers you will be saved.” The King agreed. The ques-
<>tions put by her are given below in the order they were
<>asked:--
<NI>1) Inside what atom which is unit and multiple at the
<>same time, do the lakhs of universes originate and vanish
<>as bubbles in a sea?
<NI>2) What does shine as ether and non-ether?
<NI>3) What is it that is something and nothing?
<NI>4) What is it that is going and not going at the same
<>time?
<NI>5) What is it that has taken form from voidness?
<NI>6) What is it that is moving and at the same time station-
<>ary as a rock?
<NI>7) Who draws pictures in clear sky?
<NI>8) In what seed do the worlds exist as a big tree in its
<>seed?
<NI>9) From what substance can the living and non-living
<>things in the worlds, not be separated as the foam and
<>waves cannot be separated from the ocean?
<NI>10) What substance is dualism not separate from
<>(others) as fluidity from water?
<NI>The reply given by the minister to each question is given
<>below in the order of the questions.
<NI>1) Hey, Giantess: All the questions you have put be-
<>fore us encased in figurative words discernible only to
<>the Vedic sages, are concerned with the supreme Being.
<>The atom is the supreme Spirit which is beyond all
<>knowledge of the mind and the senses. As it is without
<>organs of action it is as unmanifested as the sky. And
<>inside that supreme atom which could be felt only by the
<>mind, crores and crores of bubbles of universes originate
<>and vanish due to frailty.
<NI>2) The impersonal Supreme Being, having no substance,
<>pervades everything. This Supreme Being, Brahman,
<>is pure knowledge (Jn5a1nasvaru1pa). It is the sky and the
<>non-sky.
<NI>3) As it is indescribable the Impersonal Supreme Spirit
<>is nothing, but as it is a reality it is something.
<NI>4) As it pervades everything accessible, the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit has the quality of motion. But as it has
<>no emotions and as there exists no space beyond, it is
<>motionless.
<NI>5) As it is inaccessible to others the Supreme Spirit is
<>having no existence, but as it is the essence of everything
<>that is good, it has existence.
<NI>6) The Supreme Spirit is the radiance of motion or
<>activity and as there is nothing else to be found out, that
<>is, as it doesn't know anything else it is as rigid as a
<>rock.
<NI>7) In the clear sky the Supreme Spirit draws the pictures
<>of the universe.
<NI>8) Exists in the Supreme Atom. [Page152-b+ 65]
<NI>9) As the entire visible world cannot be separated from
<>the Supreme Spirit nothing is other than the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit.
<NI>10) The differentiations of the various worlds are mere
<>appearances of the Supreme Spirit and so dualism is of the
<>same figure.
<NI>The King drew Karkkat2i1 nearer to the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit. He advised her not to commit slaughter.
<>She accepted the advice. The King asked her to come
<>to his palace assuming the form of a beautiful woman.
<>She asked, what could he offer to a giantess as food.
<>The King said: “You good woman, we shall find out a
<>way for that. You change yourself to a beautiful woman
<>wearing golden ornaments and stay in my palace for a
<>while. I shall arrange to gather sinners, robbers and
<>such other wicked people who are to be given capital
<>punishment, in thousands from various places, and shall
<>give them to you. You can take your original form and
<>take them all to the peaks of the Himalaya and feed on
<>them.
<NI>Gluttonous people like to eat in solitude. After having
<>eaten sumptuously, take some sleep, and a little rest in
<>meditation. When you wake up you come again and
<>take away people destined to be killed. The slaughter
<>done for the sake of righteousness is not a sin. It is said
<>to be equal to mercy. When your desire for meditation
<>is over you must come to me. If an attachment of love
<>is formed even with bad persons it is difficult to break
<>the love.”
<NI>Karkkat2i1 obeyed the King. They all reached the palace.
<>Within six days three thousand wicked persons, who
<>were sentenced to death, were brought before the King,
<>from his own country and the various dependent coun-
<>tries, and were given to Karkkat2i1. In the night she took
<>her original form, gathered all the wicked people, who
<>deserved killing and bidding good bye to the King,
<>went to the Peaks of the Hima1layas. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>13) {%Brahma1 and Haindavas.%} At the end of the day of
<>Brahma1 there was the great flood, and destroying all the
<>heavens, Brahma1 went to sleep. He woke up next morn-
<>ing and after the usual morning ablutions, prepared for
<>creation. He looked around at the sky, and saw some
<>heavens still engaged in usual activities. He was amazed
<>at this unusual occurrence. Ten Brahma1s and the count-
<>less devas (gods) under them were doing their routine
<>work. Brahma1 stared at the worlds for a long time think-
<>ing “How is it”. Then he by his divine power caused one
<>of the suns, working in a heaven, to come to him, and
<>asked him. “Who are you, shining one? How have these
<>worlds come into existence?”
<NI>The Sun said with humility. “Your sons Mari1ci and
<>others erected a beautiful shed called Suvarn2atat2am,
<>in a corner of Jam3budvi1pa in the valley below Kaila1sa.
<>A Bra1hman2a named Indu arose from that hall.
<>The Brahma1n2a who was a Vedic scholar, righteous
<>and peaceful, led the life of a house-holder with his
<>wife for a long time. But they were childless. So they
<>went to Kaila1sa and did penance to get children. They
<>entered a natural arbour which was quite silent and began
<>severe penance. S4iva appeared and said that they
<>would get children.
<NI>In course of time, ten sons were born to them. After
<>a long time, when the sons had reached manhood the
<>old parents died. The sons felt very sorry. They regarded
<>life as short and full of woe and misery. So they went for [Page153-a+ 65]
<>penance, as they had no relatives left to care for them.
<>They abstained from all the pleasures of the world and
<>reached Kaila1sa. They began to meditate upon the
<>shortness of life. “What is there which is noble in this
<>world? Is there anything except woe and misery? How
<>simple is the desire of man for greatness? One thinks
<>himself prosperous if he becomes a house-holder. The
<>head of the village is more prosperous than a house-
<>holder. The King of a dependent state is more powerful
<>than the head of a village. An independent king is far
<>more prosperous than a dependent King. When we
<>think of the state of an emperor how simple is an inde-
<>pendent king! When compared with Indra, the Lord
<>of the three worlds what is an emperor after all? But
<>there is nothing glorious in the state of Indra also as it
<>ends in a Brahmamuhu1rtta (a period in the life of
<>Brahma1). So what is there substantial and eternal?
<>“Brahma1 alone is eternal and indestructible.” said the
<>eldest brother. “Concentrate your mind and say to your-
<>self, ‘I am the supreme Being Brahma1 seated on a lotus’,
<>and meditate upon it and pray for it and knowledge of
<>Brahma1 will be conferred upon you.” They understood
<>this and thus the ten brothers became Brahma1s. There
<>are ten heavens of them. They are ten worlds in the
<>sky of mind. I am the sun who creates day and night in
<>one of them,” saying thus the Sun went away. Brahma1
<>commenced his activity. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>14) {%The age of Brahma1.%} Forty-three crores twenty lacs
<>of human years is one four-yuga period called ‘Deva-
<>caturyuga’ (a period of four yugas of the devas or gods).
<>One thousand deva caturyugas will make one Maha1yuga
<>(great yuga) A Maha1yuga is a day time of Brahma1.
<>During the period of one Maha1yuga, that is, during
<>one day of Brahma1, fourteen Manus, one after another,
<>help Brahma1 in doing the work of creation. This is the
<>time of the seventh Manu in the present day time
<>(Kalpa) of the present Brahma1. The period of six Manus
<>are over in the present day time of the present Brahma1.
<>Vaivasvata is the present Manu. Brahma1 wakes up in
<>the morning--the beginning of a Kalpa. Those which
<>underwent destruction in the night, are created again
<>in the morning. As Brahma1 wakes up daily in the morn-
<>ing, what are the things created before, which do not
<>undergo destruction? At that time there will remain,
<>without destruction, six or twentyfour tattvas (princi-
<>ples) which are natural creations. These twenty-four
<>principles are not the creation of Brahma1. He who is
<>beyond names, He who created Brahma1 in the lotus
<>flower, created them. Brahma1 who was originated in the
<>lotus which grew from the nave of Na1ra1yan2a performs
<>the work of creation guided by these twentyfour princi-
<>ples. The work of creation performed by Brahma1 is
<>called Pratisarga (substitute creation). Everything
<>Brahma1 created in the day time will be destroyed in the
<>evening. After a day time is over there is the night time
<>and sleep for Brahma1. The life of Brahma1 is hundred
<>years, that is thirty-six thousand Brahma1 days and
<>and Brahma1 nights. At the expiry of this period the life
<>of Brahma1 will come to an end, and will dissolve in
<>Na1ra1yan2a. Thus crores and crores of Brahma1s have
<>appeared and passed away and in future also crores
<>will appear and pass away. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>15) {%The creations and substitute creations of Brahma1.%} The
<>creations performed by Brahma1 are of two kinds. The
<>first is Sarga or creation and the second is Pratisarga or [Page153-b+ 63]
<>substitute creation. In the first Kalpa when a Brahma1
<>is born from the lotus, certain creations are made and
<>the things thus originated do not undergo destruction in
<>the evening or at the end of the Kalpa. They are the
<>sarga or creation. On that day and every day of the life
<>of Brahma1 they help Brahma1 in the work of creation.
<>In a sense they could be called Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). But as most of them have not left sons,
<>and for other reasons also, they are not well known by
<>that name. Only the persons mentioned here have as
<>long a life as that of Brahma1. The Sanakas, Karddama,
<>Mari1ci, Atri, An3giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhr2gu,
<>Vasis2t2ha, Daks2a, Na1rada, Dharma, Adharma, Nirr2ti,
<>Sarasvati1, Ka1ma, Atharva, the Manes, Agni, Stha1n2u,
<>and Sva1yam3bhuva: these do not end at the end of a
<>Brahma1's day (or Kalpa) and will be dissolved only when
<>Brahma1 is dissolved. A Brahma1 creates in his first morn-
<>ing not only persons from Sanaka to Sva1yam3bhuva, but
<>also creations which have a history only up to the end
<>of that day, such as the lokas (worlds) of Bhu1loka,
<>Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, and minerals, plants, animals,
<>humanity etc. Sarga or creation is called Pra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i
<>(natural creation). Pratisarga or substitute creation
<>is called Apra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i or unnatural creation. At the
<>end of the Kalpa, Sam3varttaka1gni (Fire which destroys
<>the universe) and Sam3varttaka vars2a1 (Rain which des-
<>troys the universe) will occur and all the unnatural crea-
<>tions will be destroyed. In all the morning, following
<>the first morning of a Brahma1 substitute creation takes
<>place, and they are destroyed at the end of each Kalpa
<>by Sam3varttaka1gni and Sam3varttakavars2a1. (Bha1ga-
<>vata).

<NI>(52) In almost all the Pura1n2as Brahma1 is called ‘Catur-
<>mukha’ (having four faces) and to substantiate this the
<>following story is given in the Matsyapura1n2a. Brahma1
<>created S4ataru1pa1 with half the portion of his body, and
<>accepted that bright and beautiful woman as his wife.
<>He could not bear his beautiful wife to be away from
<>his sight even for a moment. So much had he become
<>attached to her.
<NI>One day S4ataru1pa1 was walking round Brahma1. The
<>daughters born from his mind also were seated close by.
<>So he could not turn round and round and look at his
<>wife as she was moving. To solve this problem, in place
<>of one face, there arose four faces.
<NI>Once S4ataru1pa1 was walking in the air. To see her at
<>that time there arose a fifth head on the top of his matted
<>hair. It is this face that was plucked off by S4iva.
<NI>(53) Various stories occur in the pura1n2as regarding how
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1. They are
<>given below. [Page155-a+ 65]
<NI>(1) Once Brahma1 praised S4iva and pleased him and
<>asked him to become his son. S4iva did not like it. He
<>got angry and cursed, “I shall become your son. But I
<>will pluck off your fifth head.”
<NI>(2) In the beginning Brahma1 created the incarnation
<>of S4iva, called Ni1lalohita also, along with the creation
<>of worlds and everything in it. In later creations Brahma1
<>did not think of Ni1lalohita. Seeing Brahma1 carrying
<>on the work of creation forgetting him, Ni1lalohita got
<>angry and cursed Brahma1, “Your fifth head will shortly
<>be destroyed.”
<NI>(3) After Brahma1 became five-faced the brightness of
<>the devas began to decrease day by day. Seeing this the
<>conceited Brahma1 said to S4iva: “I am the first who got
<>existence in this world. So by all means I am the eldest.”
<>Hearing this S4iva got angry and plucked off the fifth
<>head of Brahma1 and threw it away. (Matsyapura1n2a,
<>183, 84-86).
<NI>When the fifth head was gone, the rest of the heads were
<>benumbed. The sweat which flowed from them was
<>thrown into the earth by Brahma1. Out of it came out
<>a horrible monster, which began to chase S4iva, who
<>caught hold of it and gave it to Vis2n2u. (Skanda, 5,
<>13, 4).
<NI>(4) In the S4iva-Rudra collections a story occurs about
<>the quarrel between S4iva and Brahma1.
<NI>Once Brahma1 fell in love with Sati1 the wife of S4iva;
<>coming to know of this S4iva tried to kill Brahma1. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u tried to pacify S4iva, but it was of no avail. S4iva
<>took away the fifth head of Brahma1 and made him ugly,
<>and consequently Brahma1 became invincible in the
<>world.
<NI>(5) Once S4iva showed his daughter Sandhya1 to Brahma1
<>who grew lustful instantly; S4iva insulted Brahma1 by
<>showing this ill-owned passion of his to his sons
<>(Brahma1's sons). As a revenge Brahma1 created Sati1
<>and insulted S4iva through Daks2a. (Skanda, 2, 2, 26).

<HI>BRAHMACARYA. In ancient India an ideal life was
<>considered to pass through four stages, and Brahma-
<>carya is one of the stages of life. The four stages
<>are Brahmacarya (Vedic student vowed to chastity),
<>Ga1rhasthya (married householder), Va1naprastha (forest
<>hermit) and Sannya1sa (an ascetic who has renounced
<>the world). Brahmacarya, the first stage of the four
<>is considered as the period of education. The rules and
<>conduct of a Brahmaca1ri1 are given in Manusmr2ti,
<>Chapter 2.
<NI>The brahmaca1ri1 who lives with the teacher has to obey
<>certain rules and principles. He should bathe in the
<>river at sun-rise and offer oblations to gods and manes.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 has to abstain from using honey, meat,
<>fragrance, flowers, flower of chrysanthemum (Ind.)
<>women, curd, milk, ghee, churned-curd, slaughter,
<>bath applying oil, anointing the eyes with collyrium,
<>sandals, umbrella, lust, anger, covetousness, dance,
<>music, gambling, slander, ridicule, falsehood, and
<>causing injury to others. A Brahmaca1ri1 should go to
<>bed alone. Semen should not be made to discharge
<>through lust. If seminal discharge occurs in dream he
<>should take bath early in the morning and worship the
<>Sun, pronouncing the mantra or spell ‘Punah2’ thrice.
<>The Brahmaca1ri1 should live on alms. It is the duty of
<>the brahmaca1ri1 to bring water, flower for oblation,
<>cowdung, soil and darbha (grass) for the teacher. He
<>should receive alms only from the houses of those who
<>believe in the Vedas and sacrifices. He should not go
<>to the house of his teacher or his heirs and their families
<>for alms. Provided there are no other houses he may
<>receive alms from the houses of his teacher's relatives
<>and in the absence of such houses he may approach
<>the houses of heirs to his teacher and in the absence
<>of such houses he may receive alms from the house of
<>the teacher. He should fetch ‘Camata’ (fuel chiefly
<>from butea frondosa) from a place of purity in the [Page156-a+ 65]
<>forest, as instructed in rules and dry it in the sun; in
<>the absence of which it may be got dried in a sheltered
<>place. This fuel should be put in the sacrificial fire in
<>the mornings, at noons, and in the evenings. If a healthy
<>Brahmaca1ri1 fails in doing his duties consecutively for
<>seven days it will be considered that his vow of Brahma-
<>carya is broken and then he will have to take the vow
<>of ‘Avaki1rn2i’ again. Without waiting for the order of
<>the teacher, the Brahmaca1ri1 (student) should engage
<>himself in devotion and meditation and in the service
<>of the teacher daily. When the student is before the
<>teacher he should stand with folded hands controlling
<>his body, speech, brains, sensitive organs, and mind.
<>Only when he is asked to sit, should he do so before
<>the teacher, covering the portions of his body, which
<>are to be covered, with clothes. He should rise up in
<>the morning before his teacher wakes up, and go to
<>bed only after the teacher has retired for sleep. When
<>his teacher calls him, he should not give reply lying,
<>sitting, walking, eating or looking in the opposite
<>direction. He should not gainsay the teacher. The
<>student should attend to the orders of the teacher and
<>comply with them, sitting if the teacher is sitting,
<>standing if the teacher is standing, standing back if the
<>teacher is advancing towards him, running behind if
<>he is walking, standing close by when he is facing the
<>opposite direction, folding his limbs when the teacher
<>is lying or sitting near. The student should have his
<>seat and bed one step lower than those of his teacher.
<>The student should not sit in a careless manner in
<>places where the teacher's eyes could reaeh. He should
<>not utter the name of his teacher. If anybody speaks ill
<>of his teacher he should close his ears and run away
<>from the spot. If a Brahmaca1ri1 scoffs his teacher, he
<>will be born as a donkey, and as a dog if he scorns him,
<>and as a worm if he steals the wealth of his teacher
<>and as a beetle if he becomes jealous at the greatness
<>of his teacher. When the teacher is angry the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 should not go near him. The Brahmaca1ri1 should
<>not speak unasked. A Brahmaca1ri1 could sit with his
<>teacher only when they are in a vehicle, or on a camel
<>or in a tower or on the steps or on rocks or in a boat. He
<>should consider the teacher of his teacher as his teacher.
<>He should not address his parents who visit the house
<>of the teacher, without the permission of his teacher. He
<>should respect learned men, holymen, sons of the
<>teacher and those who are born of his family, as a
<>teacher. If the wife of the teacher is of the caste of the
<>teacher, the brahmaca1ri1 should consider her as his
<>teacher. If the wife is not of the same caste the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 needs only to stand up and make obeisance to her.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 should not apply oil to the body of his
<>teacher's wife, wash her, massage her body, and comb
<>her hair. A brahmaca1ri1 may either shave his head or
<>grow matted hair. He should never be asleep at sunrise
<>or sunset. For learning Vedas etc. the student should not
<>give the teacher cows, clothes etc. as free gifts before-
<>hand. On completion of education, when the student
<>asks the teacher for permission to get married, he should
<>give the teacher what he demands. A brahmaca1ri1 who
<>has fully complied with the rules mentioned above,
<>will attain heaven after his death.
<HI>BRAHMADATTA I. A famous king of Ka1m3pilyapura.

<>was born to An2uha by Kr2tvi1.
<NI>2) {%Previous birth and kingship.%} In Padmapura1n2a, Part
<>III, Chapter 10, there is a story stating how the
<>seven sons of Kaus4ika, a hermit, became fishermen by
<>a curse and how they got absolution and attainment
<>of heaven by offering oblations to the manes. The
<>story is given below. Brahmadatta was the rebirth of
<>Pitr2vartti, one of those seven sons.
<NI>In days of old there was a hermit named Kaus4ika in
<>Kuruks2etra. His seven sons, S4varu1pa, Krodhana,
<>Him3sra, Pis4una, Kavi, Va1gdus2t2a and Pitr2vartti were
<>studying under Garga, a teacher. Their deeds were as
<>bad as their names indicated. Their father died. The
<>sons were in want. There was no rain anywhere in the
<>world. These brothers had taken the milking cow of
<>their teacher Garga to the forest for grazing. They
<>decided to kill the cow of their teacher. The youngest
<>of them said, “If we kill the cow we can use it as
<>offerings to the manes, and the sin will not be visited
<>on us.” The elder brothers agreed to it. Accordingly
<>Pitr2vartti killed the cow and began sacrifice to the
<>manes. Two of the elder brothers were detailed to give
<>oblations to the devas, and three of them to offer
<>oblations to the manes. One was detailed to be the
<>guest and himself as the sacrificer. Thus remembering
<>the manes the sacrifice was completed with the neces-
<>sary rituals. In short, those seven hermits got divine
<>power and became daring wicked men and ate the cow
<>of their teacher. They told the teacher that the cow
<>was eaten by a leopard and gave him the calf.
<NI>In course of time they all died and were born again as
<>wild men in Das4apura. But because of their offerings to
<>the manes they had retained memory of their previous
<>births. So they fasted in holy baths and discarded their
<>lives before the people. They were born again as deer
<>in the mount of Ka1lan5jara. Because of the power of
<>knowledge and the penance and fast they discarded
<>the body of deer in Prapatana and got rebirth as
<>Cakrava1ka (ruddy goose) in the lake called Ma1nasa-
<>saras. In this birth their names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<>Vasu, Citradars4i, Sudars4i, Jn5a1ta and Jn5a1napa1raga,
<>names suitable to their character. Those seven loving
<>brothers were saints by virtue of their harmony with
<>the Supreme spirit. But owing to mental disturbance
<>three of them lost their attainments. Seeing the plea-
<>sures that King An2uha of Pa1n5ca1la was enjoying by
<>his wealth, vehicles, big army and beautiful women
<>one of the Cakrava1kas, Pitr2vartti, the devoted Bra1h-
<>man2a, who being loyal to his father had performed
<>sacrifice and given offerings to the manes, desired to
<>become a king. The other two brothers seeing the
<>wealth, glory and power of the two ministers, wished
<>to become ministers. Thus Pitr2vartti was born as the
<>son of An2uha with the name Brahmadatta and the
<>other two were born as Pun2d2ari1ka and Suba1laka, sons of
<>the two ministers. Brahmadatta was anointed as King of [Page157-a+ 65]
<>Pa1n5ca1la in the great city of Ka1m3pilya. The King
<>loved his father. He was mighty and powerful. He was
<>regular in performing sacrifices and giving offerings to
<>the manes. He had the attainment of harmony with
<>the supreme spirit. He understood the thought and
<>speech of birds and animals. He married Sannati, the
<>daughter of Sudeva (Devala); she was in her former
<>birth the cow of Garga.
<NI>Once as the King was walking in the garden with his
<>wife, he saw two ants. The minute creatures, who
<>were husband and wife were engaged in a petty quar-
<>rel. The male one, with loving words, pacified the
<>female one, who instantly came close to her husband
<>and they became happy. The King felt amazed at this
<>conversation of the ants, and he laughed. Because of
<>the attainments of his previous lives, he had the power
<>to understand the language of animals, birds, etc.
<>Seeing the King laughing without any reason the queen
<>Sannati asked him why he laughed. She said that
<>there was no reason whatsoever for the king to laugh
<>just then. The King replied, “Oh, beautiful one! just
<>now there was a quarrel between a female and a male
<>ant. I heard it, That is why I laughed. There is no
<>other reason.” The queen did not believe the King.
<>She thought that the King had been scoffing her. She
<>asked him how he came to understand the language
<>of such creatures. The King could not answer her
<>question. He fasted for seven days. On the seventh
<>day Brahma1 appeared before him and told him, “The
<>King will know everything from the words of a
<>Bra1hmin, whom he would meet when he goes to walk
<>in the streets.”
<NI>Brahmadatta returned to the palace and spent the
<>night there. Next morning he started with his wife and
<>ministers, for a walk. When they left the palace they
<>saw an old Brahmin coming towards them. Seeing the
<>king the Bra1hmin recited a verse:
<Poem>“Bra1hman2as in Kuruks2etra
<>which seven as wild men in Das4apura?
<>Stags in Ka1lan5jara, ruddy geese in Ma1nasa,
<>Then, are we, now living here”.</Poem>
<NI>When the King heard this verse the memory of his
<>former births revived and he fell down in a swoon.
<NI>There is a reason why the old Bra1hmin recited the
<>verse. The Ruddy geese mentioned before took their
<>next birth as sons of a poor Bra1hmin in the same city.
<>They had the memory of their previous births. They
<>were called Dhr2tima1n, Sarvadars4i, Vidya1candra and
<>Tapodhika, names suitable to their character. The
<>Brahmin boys decided to go for penance to attain su-
<>preme bliss. Then the poor father asked them, “My dear
<>sons, what is this? You are going away leaving your
<>poor and aged father. Is that dutiful? The sons replied,
<>“We will tell you a way to earn wealth. You recite to
<>the King, to-morrow morning this verse, which we
<>will teach you now. You will get plenty of wealth.”
<>The boys taught their father this verse and then they
<>went to the forest. Their father, the old Brahmin, came
<>to the gate of the palace at Ka1m3pilya. The King was
<>Brahmadatta.
<NI>There is another story how Brahmadatta became the
<>King of this place. Long ago An2uha, the King of Pa1n5ca1la
<>did penance before Brahma1, who appeared before the
<>King and asked him what he desired. The King made
<>his request that he might have a son who should be a [Page157-b+ 64]
<>mighty hero, a learned man, a great hermit and who
<>could understand the language of all living creatures.
<>Brahma1 granted him boon and thus Brahmadatta was
<>born to An2uha. It was before this Brahmadatta that
<>the Bra1hman2a recited his verse and it was that King
<>who swooned and fell down.
<NI>The two ministers were Suba1laka the son of Ba1bhravya
<>who was the author of the Ka1mas4a1stra and Pun2d2ari1ka
<>the son of Pa1n5ca1la who propagated the science of
<>medicine. They also remembered about their former
<>births and also fell down unconscious. When they
<>recovered the King Brahmadatta and the minister
<>Subala and Pun2d2ari1ka bemoaned the loss of powers
<>they had attained before by devotion, meditation,
<>penance and sacrifice. They cried, “Fate has made us
<>desirous of the objects of our senses and we have lost our
<>harmony with the Supreme Spirit.” They repeated the
<>cry again and again and they spoke about the blessings
<>obtained by offering oblation to their manes. Brahma-
<>datta gave the old Bra1hman2a plenty of wealth and
<>several villages and sent him fully satisfied. Then he
<>anointed his capable and fully qualified son Vis2vaksena
<>as King and with his retinue retired to Ma1nasa-saras
<>for penance.
<NI>3) {%A bird as his wife when he was King.%} When Brahma-
<>datta was the King of Ka1m3pilyapura a bird named
<>Tapani1ya1 become his friend. Her head was purple
<>coloured and body black. By and by this bird became
<>his wife. A daughter named Sarvasena1 was born to
<>Brahmadatta by his bird-wife. The King had sons by
<>other wives. Tapani1ya1 would wash her child and place
<>her in the cradle early in the morning and then
<>go to the forest and fly about in the air. She would
<>return in the evening and tell the King news all over
<>the world. It went on like this for a long time.
<NI>Once, when there was nobody in the room a prince
<>took Sarvasena1 from the cage and choked her to death.
<>Tapani1ya1 returned and seeing the dead body of her
<>daughter, waited for a long time. Finally she pecked
<>out the eyes of the prince and flew away into the air.
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 20).
<HI>BRAHMADATTA II. Another King who ruled over
<>Ka1m3pilya. This King was the son of the hermit Cu1li
<>and his wife Somada1, a Gandharva woman whose
<>mother was U1rmila1. When he was ruling Ka1m3pilya,
<>Kus4ana1bha was the King of Ka1nyakubja. One hund-
<>red beautiful daughters were born to the King
<>Kus4ana1bha. One day while they were playing in the
<>jungle Va1yubhagava1n (wind-god) saw them and grew
<>lustful. But they did not yield to his request. So he got
<>angry and cursed them and they became hump-backed.
<>The King was very sorry. He presented his hundred
<>hunch-backed daughters to King Brahmadatta, who,
<>by his divine power straightened their backs. When
<>they regained their former form they became the wives
<>of Brahmadatta. This story occurs in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sargas 32 & 33.
<HI>BRAHMADATTA III. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhavis2ya Parva, Chapter 104, about another Brahma-
<>datta. He was the King of Sa1lva. Though he had two
<>wives he had no children. Finally by the grace of
<>S4iva two children were born to them. They were called
<>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka. (For further information see
<>D2ibhaka). [Page158-a+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMADATTA IV. A king who ruled over the coun-
<>try of Ka1s4i. One night he saw two swans flying in the
<>air. They were of golden colour. There were a num-
<>ber of swans around them. They seemed like two
<>lightnings in the midst of white clouds. Brahmadatta
<>wished to see them again. His desire increased to such
<>an extent that he had desire for nothing else. He
<>consulted his ministers and made a lake. Every crea-
<>ture which seemed beautiful to him was brought to
<>that place. Hearing this those two swans also came
<>there. By and by he tamed them and asked them how
<>they got the golden colour. The swans said thus:
<>“Oh King! you might have heard of the famous moun-
<>tain Mandara, which is the field of games of the Devas
<>(gods). At the time of the churning of the milk sea
<>when this mountain was used as churn-drill, Amr2tam3
<>(celestial nectar of immortality) touched this moun-
<>tain. So the flowers, fruits and roots in the vicinity of
<>this mountain got the power of removing death, wrin-
<>kles etc. Candracu1d2a also will come to this mountain
<>occasionally to play on the top of it and so it became
<>more glorious than the mount Kaila1sa. One day
<>while Maha1deva was playing in those gardens he had
<>to leave on an urgent matter concerning Gods. So he
<>left Pa1rvati1 there and went away. Devi1 began to walk
<>about in those gardens with pangs of separation.
<>Spring season came. The Gan2as (servants of S4iva) and
<>the maids of Pa1rvati1 attended on her. One day Man2i-
<>pus2pes4vara, a Gan2a, hankered after Candralekha1,
<>daughter of Jaya1. She had been engaged in fanning
<>Pa1rvati1. Both were young and their figures suited each
<>other. Candralekha1 reciprocated his love. Under-
<>standing this Pin3ges4vara and Guhes4vara, two gan2as
<>looked at each other and smiled. Seeing this Devi1
<>looked round with anger to see what caused them to
<>smile. They squinted their eyes and showed Manipus2-
<>pe vara and Candralekha1 to Devi1. Because of separation
<>she had been much worried, weary and sad. So all
<>these affairs made her angry. She said: “It is good
<>that you behave like this when I am in this plight !
<>The two are making love. Seeing that, you are laughing.
<>May these two dotards be born on the earth and be-
<>come husband and wife there. Let you two who
<>laughed before me without humility also be born on
<>the earth, first as poor Bra1hman2as, and then as
<>Brahmaraks2as (demon friends), outcasts, robbers,
<>dogs with tails cut off and finally as various kind of
<>birds.” Thus she cursed the four of gan2as. Then a
<>gan2a named Dhu1rjat2a said to Pa1rvati1: “Devi1, this is
<>unfortunate. They have not commited any severe
<>crime.” Devi1 got angry at him and cursed him too:
<>“May you also be born on the earth as a human be-
<>ing.” After this Jaya the loved maid of Pa1rvati1 reques-
<>ted her for absolution from curse, for all. The Devi1
<>said that all of them would get absolution at the place
<>of penance of Brahma1 and other gods and would re-
<>turn here. Of these, Candralekha1 and her husband and
<>Dhu1rjat2a would be happy on the earth. The two
<>others would lead a miserable life on the earth.”

<HI>BRAHMAHATYA1. Killing a Bra1hman2a is called Brahma-
<>hatya1. In ancient India killing a Bra1hmin was consi-
<>dered to be a great sin. He, who committed this sin
<>had to build a hut in the forest and live there for a
<>period of twelve years, or make an alms-pot called
<>‘S4ivas4irodhvaja’ and wander about begging alms, to
<>purify his soul, or else to attempt to jump into a
<>blazing fire thrice with bowed head, or perform one
<>of the three sacrifices As4vamedha, Svarjit or Gosava.
<>If none of these was possible, he had to give all the
<>wealth he had to Bra1hmins well-versed in Vedas, as
<>gift. It is mentioned in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 169, that
<>if any of the vows mentioned above was performed he
<>would be absolved from the sin of Brahmahatya1.

<>before the sunrise is called Bra1hmamuhu1rta. The
<>deity of this period is Brahma1. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 155, it is instructed that one should wake up at
<>this period and engage in prayer and meditation.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A. (BRA1HMIN).
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} Bra1hman2as, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas, and S4u1dras
<>are the caturvarn2as or the four castes. The Pura1n2as say
<>that the four castes originated from different parts of
<>the body of Brahma1. See Manusmr2ti, Chapter 1,
<>Stanza 87
<Poem>“Sarvasya1sya tu sargasya
<>Guptyartham3 sa maha1dyutih2
<>Mukhaba1hu1ru1pajja1na1m3
<>Pr2thakkarma1n2yakalpayat.</Poem>
<NI>(With a view to sustain the world, Brahma1 ordered acti-
<>vities, for the four castes (Bra1hman2a Ks2atriya, Vais4ya,
<>and S4u1dra) who were born from his face, arms, thighs
<>and feet). From this statement it is seen that the Bra1h-
<>man2as were born from the face, Ks2atriyas from the
<>arms, Vais4yas from the thighs and Su1dras from the feet
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>2) {%The activities of a Bra1hman2a.%} The duties of a Bra1hman2a
<>are, performing sacrifice, and encouraging others to
<>perform sacrifice, learning Vedas and teaching Vedas,
<>giving gifts and getting remuneration. A Bra1hman2a has
<>two births in one life. Till the time of investiture with
<>the sacred string is one birth and from that period on-
<>wards is the second birth. So a Bra1hman2a is called
<>‘dvija’ or twice-born.
<NI>The Bra1hman2as were allowed to do the works of agri-
<>culture, keeping cows, trade and commerce and Kusi1da
<>(money-lending). Living on the interest of money
<>giving out as loan is Kusi1da. But they should not trade
<>on products from cow, jaggery, salt, lac and flesh.
<>The suffix ‘S4arma1’ should be added to the name of
<>Bra1hman2a. A Bra1hman2a can have four wives.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A(M). See Veda.
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2A. The word Brahma1n2d2a means the an2d2a
<>of Brahma1 (an2d2a-egg), the Supreme Being which is
<>the root of the origin of the universe. At a time long
<>ago, which is beyond reckoning, there was nothing but
<>an egg. This egg was split into two and from it a male [Page159-a+ 64]
<>child with the radiance of innumerable suns came out.
<>This wonderful child was helpless. After his birth he
<>cried for a while, because of hunger and thirst. He
<>got no help. There was nobody to feed it. So this
<>wonderful child looked up and lay there. This help-
<>less child was called ‘Vira1t2purus2a’ (the next emanation
<>from Brahma1) by those versed in the Pura1n2as. The
<>boy was so called because he was the most material
<>of materiality. But he was an atom of atoms and the
<>first figuration of God. From each pore of the skin of
<>the great vira1t2, who was the base of all the worlds a
<>universe came into being. Thus all the countless uni-
<>verses were born. Each universe has its own trinity of
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and devas (the bright ones), the
<>protectors of the eight zones. One universe comprises
<>fourteen worlds or realms, from Pa1ta1la to the Brahma-
<>loka (from the nether world to the upper world or
<>the realm of Brahma1). Countless such universes exist.
<>Over and above all these universes there is Vaikun2t2ha,
<>and above Vaikun2t2ha there is another world with an
<>area of fifty crore yojanas (leagues), called ‘Goloka’ (the
<>world of cow). Only the two worlds Vaikun2t2ha and
<>the Goloka are eternal. Bhu1loka (the earth) consists
<>of seven islands and sixty-four peninsulas. There are
<>seven worlds above and seven worlds below. The seven
<>upper worlds are Bhu1loka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Jana-
<>loka, Tapoloka. Satyaloka and Brahmaloka. Thus a
<>universe consists of fourteen worlds. This is the idea
<>given by the Pura1n2as about Brahma1n2d2a. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandhas 9).
<NI>Mention is made, in the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2,
<>Chapter 7, about the construction of Brahma1n2d2a.
<NI>This Brahma1n2d2a, like the seed of the Kapittha tree
<>(Vitar--the wood-apple), is covered under, above and
<>all around by an2d2akat2a1ha (egg-shell). The an2d2a (egg)
<>is covered by water ten times the egg in volume. This
<>water-shell is covered by a shell of fire. Around the
<>shell of fire there is the shell of air and the air-shell
<>is covered with ether. Around the shell of ether there
<>is the shell of Egoism of darkness. Over the shell of
<>Egoism there is the shell of glory and the shell of
<>glory is covered by Prakr2ti, the Divine Nature. It is
<>immeasurable. Prakr2ti contains numberless Brah-
<>ma1n2d2as. As oil exists in sesame, God pervades the whole
<>universe. This is the connection between Prakr2ti and
<>Purus2a. (The Nature and the Supreme Spirit).
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2APURA1N2A. One of the eighteen pura1n2as.
<>This pura1n2a contains a talk by Brahma1 about the glory
<>of Brahma1n2d2a. There are twelve thousand verses in

<>connected with the temples of Kerala.
<HI>BRAHMA1N5JALI. When a disciple stands before his

<>both arms in this way is called Brahma1n5jali. (Manu-
<>smr2ti, Chapter 2).
<HI>BRAHMAPRALAYA. See Manvantara.
<HI>BRAHMAPURA1N2A, (BRA1HMAPURA1N2A). This is a
<>great book of twenty-five thousand verses taught to
<>the great hermit-sage Mari1ci by Brahma1. It is mention-
<>ed in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 271, that if a copy of this
<>book is taken and offered to a Brahmin on the full
<>moon day of the month of Vais4a1kha with cow and
<>water, the giver will attain heaven. [Page159-b+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMAPURI1. The abode of Brahma1. Brahmapuri1 is
<>on the summit of Maha1meru, with an area of fourteen
<>thousand yojanas (leagues). Around this city, at the
<>four sides, (East etc.) and at the four corners (South-
<>East etc.) there are eight towns, very big and beautiful,
<>kept by eight protectors such as Indra and others. The
<>river Gan3ga1 which springs from the feet of Maha1vis2n2u
<>wets the whole of Candraman2d2ala (Lunar region),
<>falls down on the Brahmapuri1, and dividing itself into
<>four rivers called Si1ta1, Alakananda1, Caks2us and Bhadra1
<>flows in four directions. The river Si1ta1 flows through
<>the top of the mountains and passing through the
<>mountain in the east called Bhadra1s4va, falls in the
<>Eastern Ocean. The river Alakananda1 flows to the
<>south and reaches Bha1rata. Then it divides into seven
<>rivers which unite in the ocean. The river Caks2us pas-
<>ses through the mountains in the west and enters the
<>country called Ketuma1lavars2a and then flows into the
<>ocean. The river Bhadra1 passes through all the moun-
<>tains in the north and flows through the north country
<>of the Kuru1s2a and falls in the North Ocean. The moun-
<>tain of Ma1lyava1n in the west and the mountain of
<>Gandhama1dana in the east are as long as the moun-
<>tain of Ni1lagiri in the north and the mountain of
<>Nis2adha in the south. Mount Meru shaped like an ear-
<>ring stands in the middle of these four mountains.

<>complete army consisting of 21870 horses and 109350
<>infantry). Though he had married two daughters of
<>the King of Ka1s4i he was childless. The sorrowful king
<>went with his wives to a hermit named Can2d2akaus4ika
<>and pleased him by giving him precious stones. The
<>King told the hermit about his sorrow due to lack of
<>children. The hermit gave them a mango fruit and
<>said that the King should enthrone the son who would
<>be born by eating the mango, and return to the forest
<>for penance. The hermit gave eight boons for the son

<>divided the mango fruit into two and both of his wives
<>ate the fruit and became pregnant. Each of them gave
<>birth to half of a child. The lifeless forms of these half
<>children were thrown out. A giantess called Jara1 put
<>them together and instantly the pieces joined together
<>and became a living child. The giantess took that child
<>and made a present of it to the King. That child grew up
<>and was known by the famous name Jara1sandha. From

<>When Jara1sandha came of age the King anointed him
<>as King and went to the hermitage of Can2d2akaus4ika
<>with his wives and began to do penance. After coming
<>to the forest Br2hadratha killed a giant named R2s2abha
<>and with his hide made three Big drums and placed
<>them in the city. The sound of one beat on the drum
<>will last for a month. When Bhi1ma, Arjuna and S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a came to Magadha to kill Jara1sandha they broke
<>these drums. (M.B. A1di Parva, 53; Sabha1 Parva,

<HI>BR2HASPATI. The teacher of the devas (Gods).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The father of Br2haspati was An3giras, the
<>son of Brahma1. Brahma1 grew amorous, at the sight of
<>some celestial maids who were present at a sacrifice
<>performed by Rudra; and he had seminal flow.
<>Brahma1 put the semen in fire. From that fire the devas
<>such as Mari1ci, Bhr2gu, An3giras and others were born.
<>The name An3giras was given because he was born out
<>of an3ga1ra (live-coal). Eight sons were born to An3giras
<>by his wife Vasuda1. They were Utathya, Br2haspati,
<>Vayasya, S4a1nti, Ghora, Viru1pa, Sam3varta and Sudh-
<>anva1. All of them were sages who had attained one-
<>ness with the supreme Spirit by knowledge, and who
<>had been free from worldly pain. Of them Br2haspati,
<>Utathya and Sam3varta became famous through all
<>the worlds. In some pura1n2as Vasuda1, the mother of
<>Br2haspati, is given the name S4raddha1 also.
<NI>It is stated that Br2haspati had a sister named A1n3girasi1.
<>She was a follower of the Brahma1 cult. She became
<>the wife of Prabha1sa the last one of the eight Vasus.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 218 that the mother of Br2haspati had another name, S4ubha1, and that Br2has-
<>pati had six more brothers, born later, named Br2hatki1rti, Br2hatjyoti, Br2hadbrahma1, Br2hadmana1, Br2hadmantra, and Br2hadbha1sa and that
<>A1n3girasi1 had the name Bha1numati1 also.</F>
<>Vis4vakarma1 was her son. (Bha1gavata Skandha 4, Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 66).
<NI>2) {%Is Br2haspati the son of Agni?%} In some pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is described as the son of Agni. Its authority
<>is given below. An3giras, the father of Br2haspati was
<>once doing penance in his hermitage. When the fire of
<>penance increased the brightness of the real fire
<>decreased. Agni (fire) stood before An3giras and said
<>“Oh Lord! your brightness surpasses mine. From this
<>day onwards you are the real fire. So you shall be the
<>first fire and I will be the fire of Praja1pati which is the
<>second fire.”
<NI>Because of this boon of Agni, the devas (gods), recog-
<>nized An3giras also as a fire-god. So in some Pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is mentioned as the son of Agni (fire-god).
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 4). [Page162-b+ 62]
<NI>3) {%Teacher of the Devas.%} The story of how Br2haspati
<>became the teacher of the devas, is given in the
<>Bha1s2a1bha1rata, Chapter 76 as shown below:
<NI>“The Suras and the asuras (the gods and the demons)
<>became enemies from time immemorial, regarding the
<>possession of wealth and prosperity in the three worlds.
<>To secure victory in the battles the gods made Br2has-
<>pati their teacher and likewise the asuras made S4ukra
<>their teacher.”
<NI>The devas and asuras began to fight for prosperity
<>and wealth. At that time the devas selected Br2haspati
<>and the asuras selected S4ukra, as their teacher.
<NI>4) {%The conjugality of Br2haspati.%} Ta1ra1 was the wife of
<>Br2haspati. She was very beautiful. Seeing Candra's
<>handsome figure she doted on him. There arose several
<>quarrels over this affair. Finally the devas intervened
<>and Ta1ra1 was given back to Br2haspati1. Budha was
<>born to Candra by Ta1ra1.
<NI>The individual called Ta1ra in the family of the monkeys,
<>was a son of Br2haspati. It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 17, Stanza 10 as follows,
<>which proves this fact.
<NI>“Br2haspati begot the mighty monkey Ta1ra.” In the
<>R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 19, Su1kta 126, it is
<>mentioned that Br2haspati had a daughter named
<>Romas4a1. When her husband teased her Romas4a1 said
<>to her husband: “You please come and feel your
<>hand on my body. Don't think that my organs are
<>small. Though I am hairy like the goats of Ga1ndha1ra,
<>I have got all the organs fully grown.” This is the
<>statement in the R2gveda. In the Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>it is stated that Br2haspati had a Bra1hman2a son named
<>Kus4adhvaja, and that a daughter named Devavati1 was
<>born to Kus4adhvaja. Devavati1 was born from his
<>mouth while Kus4adhvaja was engaged in devotional
<>recitation of the Vedas. Si1ta1 was the rebirth of this
<>Devavati1. It is stated in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 67, Stanza 69, that Dron2a, the son of Bhara-
<>dva1ja, was born from a portion of Br2haspati. Kaca was
<>another son of Br2haspati. For full particulars of the
<>story how Devaya1ni1 (daughter of S4ukra) hankered
<>after Kaca, see ‘Kaca’. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza 1,
<>that Br2haspati had a wife called Ca1ndramasi1 and that
<>she gave birth to six Agnis. In Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a mention is made that Br2haspati had a
<>daughter named Sulekha1. Six sons and a daughter
<>were born to Ca1ndramasi1. The six sons were six Agnis
<>(fires): In sacrifices the burnt offerings and the ghee
<>were the portions meant for the great and mighty fire
<>S4amyu, the son of Br2haspati. It is to satisfy this great
<>fire which blazes with numberless pointed tongues, that
<>in sacrifices such as Ca1turma1sya, As4vamedha etc. ani-
<>mals are slaughtered. The daughter of Dharma was
<>the wife of S4am3yu. The name of the wonderful being
<>(S4amyu's wife) is Satya1. A son named Di1pti and three
<>daughters were born to S4amyu. The son of Di1pti is
<>Bharadva1ja who is the recipient of first portion of Ghee
<>oblated in sacrifice. On all full-moon days offerings
<>of sacrifices are meant for Bharata. Bharata had a son
<>named Bha1rata and a daughter named Bha1rati1. Bharata
<>the Agni is said to be the son of the Agni who is Praja1- [Page163-a+ 65]
<>pati Bharata. Thus Bharata got the famous name ‘the
<>great’. Bharata married Vi1ra1 and a son was born to
<>them called Vi1ra. This Vi1ra like Soma is the recipient
<>of sacrificial ghee, according to the belief of the Bra1h-
<>man2as. As this Vi1ra is the recipient of the second ghee
<>offered in sacrifice, as Soma, he is known by names
<>such as Rathaprabhu, Rathadhva1na and Kumbharetas.
<>Vi1ra married Sarayu1 and became the father of Siddhi--
<>Siddhi the Agnidevata1--who is remembered in all
<>fire songs. Fire which has no action on prosperity,
<>fame and vigour has the name Nis4cyavana. Nis4cya-
<>vana praises the earth. Satya is the son of Nis4cyavana.
<>Satya which blazes by flame determines time. Satya is
<>known by another name Nis2kr2ti. The Agni Svana
<>spreads diseases. The Agnis called Vipulaprabha, Yat-
<>a1tma1 and Brahmaca1ri are invoked in simple domestic
<>sacrifices by Bra1hman2as. The awful fire Bad2ava1gni is
<>supported by life. The sixth son of Br2haspati and Ta1ra1
<>is called S4vetakr2t. The oblation offered to this Agni
<>is known as Udadva1ra. Sva1ha1 was the daughter of
<>Ca1ndramasi1. Sva1ha1 had three sons. They are three
<>Agnis called Ka1ma1gni, Amogha, and Ukthya. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 4).
<NI>5) {%Growing amorous on the wife of elder brother.%} A story
<>stating how Br2haspati begot a son by the wife of
<>Utathya is given in Skandha 9 of Bha1gavata. Mamata1,
<>the wife of Utathya, was pregnant. Br2haspati had
<>coition with her when her husband was away. The
<>mother and the child in the womb who opposed the
<>act of Br2haspati were cursed. Mamata1 gave birth to two
<>children. Fearing that her husband might cast her out
<>she left the son of Br2haspati in the forest and was
<>about to go, when there was a divine voice from above,
<>“Mu1d2he, Bharadva1jamimam bhara dva1jam3 Br2has-
<>pate.” “You senseless woman, bring up this one born
<>of the two. Br2haspati, bring up this one born of the
<>two.” Hearing this ethereal voice Br2haspati took the
<>child and gave him the name Bharadva1ja and brought
<>him up. After that the child was given to emperor
<>Bharata. The famous archer Dron2a was the son of this
<>Bharadva1ja.
<NI>6) {%Personation of Br2haspati.%} The enmity between the
<>devas and asuras increased day by day. S4ukra1ca1rya
<>the teacher of the asuras began to do penance before
<>S4iva in the Hima1layas, with a view to get a divine
<>spell or incantation to destroy the devas. The duration
<>of the penance was thousand years. Indra came to
<>know of this secret and sent his daughter Jayanti1 to
<>get the spell from S4ukra by deceit. She stayed with
<>S4ukra as his disciple and servant. Thousand years passed
<>by. S4iva appeared before S4ukra and gave him the spell,
<>capable of destroying the devas. When he was about
<>to return Jayanti1 accepted him as her husband. Be-
<>cause of his familiarity with her, of a long standing,
<>he could not refuse her request. S4ukra told her that
<>he would become her husband, for a period of ten
<>years and that during that period both of them would
<>be invisible to the world. Thus the couple began an
<>invisible life.
<NI>Br2haspati thought of making the best use of this period.
<>He personated himself as S4ukra1ca1rya and went to the
<>Asuras, who thinking that their teacher had returned
<>after a long penance gave him a loving and sincere
<>welcome. Br2haspati sat on the seat of S4ukra1ca1rya and
<>began to exhort the asuras in such a manner that [Page163-b+ 64]
<>within the period of ten years he was able to remove
<>factionalism and hatred from them.
<NI>At the expiry of ten years' invisible life S4ukra returned
<>having sent Jayanti1 away. The asuras saw two S4ukras
<>together and were amazed. They declared that the
<>real S4ukra was he who had been teaching them for the
<>last ten years. Being dismayed at the ingratitude of the
<>asuras he cursed them that they would shortly be
<>destroyed and then left the place. At this juncture
<>Br2haspati also assumed his real form and returned to
<>heaven. Thus the asuras became a people without a
<>leader like sheep without a shepherd. At last they
<>approached their teacher S4ukra who became their
<>teacher again, when they begged for his pardon. But
<>he said that his curse could not be recalled. But he
<>gave them absolution by saying that they would regain
<>their lost power during the time of Manu Sa1varn2i.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>7) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a was returning haugh-
<>ty and proud after having defeated the devas and con-
<>quered heaven, when Sulekha1 the daughter of Br2has-
<>pati, got terrified and ran away to hide herself from
<>him. Ra1van2a chased her and when she was caught he
<>tried to ravish her. Br2haspati got angry and cursed him.
<>“You, who have grown rank by the dart of Cupid,
<>will meet with death by the dart of Ra1ma”. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>8) {%Br2haspati and Hanu1ma1n.%} An5jana1 the mother of
<>Hanu1ma1n was a servant of Br2haspati in her previous
<>birth. Her name then was Pun5jika1sthali1. She once went
<>to fetch water. At that time many Vidya1dhara young
<>people, both male and female, came there and engaged
<>in amorous acts. Pun5jika1sthali1 witnessed these love
<>scenes for a long time and then returned home. It is
<>mentioned in Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a that Br2haspati
<>cursed her to be born in the next birth as a female
<>monkey.
<NI>An5jana1 gave birth to Hanu1ma1n. When he grew up
<>Hanu1ma1n desired to learn Vedas and S4a1stras (scrip-
<>tures). Hanu1ma1n approached Br2haspati to learn from
<>him. But Br2haspati was not prepared to teach a monkey
<>who jumped about everywhere. The disappointed
<>Hanu1ma1n went to the Sun, who asked him how it
<>could be done by him as he was engaged in travelling
<>without stop. Hanu1ma1n said that he would move in
<>front of the sun always. Thus Hanu1ma1n who had been
<>rejected by Br2haspati became the disciple of the Sun.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>9) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) It is mentioned in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 1, that
<>Br2haspati was the teacher of the hermit S4uka.
<NI>(2) In Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 51, it is instructed that
<>Br2haspati should be consecrated in temples as wearing
<>a necklace of beads (Elaeo carpus seeds) and a water
<>pot.
<NI>(3) Mention is made in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 169, Stanza 21 that Br2haspati gave Bhara-
<>dva1ja A1gneya1stra (the arrow of fire).
<NI>(4) During the period of emperor Pr2thu, when the
<>Earth-goddess was changed into a cow the gods employ-
<>ed Br2haspati to milk the cow to obtain the things they
<>needed. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 69).
<NI>(5) Once Br2haspati gave Subrahman2ya a stick as a
<>present. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46). [Page164-a+ 63]
<NI>(6) Once Br2haspati advised Indra to use sweet words.
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 84).
<NI>(7) Once Br2haspati got angry with Maha1vis2n2u at the
<>sacrificial hall of Uparicaravasu. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 336, Stanza 14).
<NI>(8) Br2haspati cursed the Jaladevata1s (goddesses of
<>water). (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 242, Stanza 27).
<NI>(9) Br2haspati and Candra are said to be Bra1hman2a
<>Kings. (M.B. As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 8).
<NI>(10) {%Conclusion.%} Br2haspati was a deep thinker and one
<>who had firm convictions in many matters. He was a
<>man of vast knowledge. Every movement of the gods
<>had its origin in the brains of Br2haspati. There is no
<>philosophy which does not contain the exhortations
<>made by Bhaspati at various times to the devas (gods)
<>or kings or hermits.

<NI>1) Birth. Br2haspati the teacher-priest of the devas
<>had a very beautiful wife named Ta1ra1. One day seeing
<>the handsome figure of Candra, Ta1ra1 became amorous.
<>Candra was the Disciple of Br2haspati. It was not right
<>on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous
<>towards a disciple. Br2haspati came to know of the
<>affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his
<>wife. Both Candra and Ta1ra1 did not pay any heed to
<>Br2haspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle.
<>The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing
<>that this was not an honourable thing some devas
<>tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Ta1ra1
<>to Br2haspati. At this time Ta1ra1 was pregnant. Both

<>book called Dharmas4a1stra on the different kinds of
<>rites of consecration, initiation etc. from formation in
<>the womb till Upanayana (investiture with the Brahma1
<>string), different kinds of marriages, Pan5camaha1yaj-
<>n5as (the five essential sacrifices) S4ra1ddha (offering
<>to the manes), Pa1kayajn5a (simple domestic sacri-
<>fices), Somaya1ga (drinking the moon-plant juice at
<>the Soma sacrifice) and such other matters of ethics.
<HI>BUDHA IV. A Bra1hman2a who lived in Gaud2ades4a.
<>Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too
<>much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on
<>the veranda of the house of a harlot. His father became
<>anxious about him as he had not returned though the
<>night had advanced much. He searched everywhere
<>and finally came to the place where he was lying un-
<>conscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry
<>killed his father then and there.
<NI>After that he returned home. His mother advised him
<>to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him.
<>Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments
<>on his way, he put an end to their lives.
<NI>Once this Bra1hman2a carried away Sulabha1 the beauti-
<>ful wife of hermit Ka1labhu1ti and ravished her. Sulabha1
<>cursed him and made him a leper.
<NI>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King
<>S4u1rasena. On that day the King was about to go to
<>Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However
<>hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an
<>inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away
<>the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer
<>have made the plane stationary.”
<NI>S4u1rasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper
<>and cured him with catura1ks2ari1mantra (a spell of four
<>letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
<>(Gan2es4a Pura1n2a 1:76).
<HI>BUDDHA. The founder of Buddhism. Some consider
<>him to be an incarnation of Vis2n2u. In days of old in
<>a battle the devas were defeated by the asuras and the
<>gods approached Vis2n2u with their grievance. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u incarnated as the son of S4uddhodana with the [Page165-b+ 65]
<>name Gautamabuddha (Siddha1rtha). Then he went
<>to the asuras and made them reject the Vedas and the
<>laws thereof. All the Daityas (Asuras) became Bud-
<>dhists. There is a story in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 16,
<>that thus it was the purpose of Buddha to convert
<>every asura to Buddhism and send him to hell.
<NI>The story given above is in accordance with the Pura1-
<>n2as. The following are the facts gained by historic
<>investigations.
<NI>Gautama Buddha was born in B.C. 560, in Kapilavastu
<>near the Hima1layas. His father was S4uddhodana. He
<>was born in the family of the S4a1kyas. The word ‘S4a1kya’
<>is another form of the word Ks2atriya. The real name of
<>Buddha was Siddha1rtha. S4uddhodana brought up his
<>son in such a way that he should not be subjected to
<>any sort of mental pain or worry. So he kept Buddha
<>aloof from the outer world. Thus he spent his childhood
<>in comfort and pleasure. Once by chance he happened
<>to see a sick man, an old man and a dead body. The
<>sight made him thoughtful. He began to think upon
<>a way to remove sorrow and pain from the world and
<>to bring about peace and comfort.
<NI>The change that appeared in the son worried the
<>father. So at the age of sixteen he made Siddha1rtha
<>marry Yas4odhara1. A son was born to them. But the
<>mind of Siddha1rtha was restless, distressed and agi-
<>tated. One day Siddha1rtha discarded everything and
<>went out of the palace alone.
<NI>Siddha1rtha wandered from place to place learning
<>from various teachers. But he did not find peace.
<>Once on a full-moon day while he was sitting in medi-
<>tation under a banian tree he got ‘Bodha’. (insight or
<>conviction). From that day onwards he began to be
<>known by the name ‘Buddha’. After that he came to
<>Ka1s4i, and told his disciples how he got Bodha or con-
<>viction. The number of his followers increased day by
<>day. Thus Buddhism came into being. Buddha said
<>that the reason for pain and sorrow in the world was
<>desire and that sorrow could be exterminated only
<>by controlling and overcoming all desire. To attain
<>Eternal Bliss one should be true and righteous in
<>thought, deed and word and that ‘Not Killing’ was
<>the foundation of righteousness. Buddhism spread
<>everywhere in Bha1rata.
<NI>Gautama Buddha died at the age of eighty.
<HI>BUDDHAGHOS2A. An ancient Sanskrit poet. It is be-
<>lieved that he lived in the 4th century A.D. The
<>most important work of this poet who was a Buddhist,
<>is ‘Padyacu1d2a1man2i’. The life of Buddha is described
<>in this Book in ten Ka1n2d2as (sections). A similarity to
<>the poems of Ka1lida1sa and As4vaghos2a is seen in this
<>poem. Buddhaghos2a is said to have reached Ceylon
<>in 357 A.D. and translated some Buddhist literature.
<HI>BUDDHI. A wife of Dharmadeva. In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7, it is mentioned that Dharmadeva
<>had married thirteen daughters of Daks2a. They are
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,
<>Buddhi, Lajja1, Vapus, S4a1nti, Siddhi1 and Ki1rti.
<HI>BUDDHIKA1MA. An attendant of S4ubrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>Salya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 12).
<HI>BUDDHISM. (BUDDHA-MATA). The origin of Bud-
<>dhism was in the sixth century B.C. This new religion
<>was shaped out of Hinduism that prevailed at that
<>time. Buddhism which had its origin in North India,
<>prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh [Page166-a+ 65]
<>century A.D. During that period there was an over-
<>flow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now
<>this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma.
<>90% of the population there, are adherents of Bud-
<>dhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the
<>people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are
<>now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines
<>the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indo-
<>nesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of
<>Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are consi-
<>dered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are
<>only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In count-
<>ries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism.
<>Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixty-
<>five thousand Buddhists in North America, one
<>hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America,
<>and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists
<>in the world today is 150.31 crores.
<H>C
<HI>C. ({#ca#}) The letter C has two meanings, viz., evil people
<>and pure man.
<HI>CAIDYA. S4is4upa1la, king of Cedi. Dhr2s2t2aketu, King of
<>Cedi, is also known by this name. It was this Caidya
<>who led the Kraun5cavyu1ha created by Dhr2s2t2adyumna
<>in the great battle. (Kraun5cavyu1ha = A battle array
<>in the shape of a stork). (S4loka 47, Chapter 50, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>CAITRARATHA. A prince born to King Kuru of his
<>queen Va1hini1 (S4loka 50, Chapter 94, A1di Parva).
<HI>CAITRARATHA(M). A forest of pura1n2ic fame. Once
<>King Yaya1ti enjoyed sexual acts with the apsaras
<>Vis4va1ci1 in this forest. (S4loka 43, Chapter 75, A1di
<>Parva). It was here in this forest that Pa1n2d2u spent some
<>days once with his wives Ma1dri1 and Kunti1. (S4loka 48,
<>Chapter 118, A1di Parva).
<NI>As a support to the great mountain Maha1meru were
<>four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supa1rs4va
<>and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood,
<>Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhra1jaka and Sarvatobhadra.
<>Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on
<>Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pan5cama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>CAITRARATHA PARVA. A sub-division of A1di Parva,
<>(See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>CAITYAKA. A mountain. This mountain is situated
<>near Girivraja, the capital city of Magadha. This moun-
<>tain was very dear to the people of Magadha. The
<>followers of Br2hadratha deemed it as a God and
<>worshipped it. (Chapter 21, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CAKAT2A. (See Brahmadatta II).
<HI>CAKRA I. A son of Va1suki, the Na1ga king. He died at
<>the serpent yajn5a (Sarpa Satra) of Janamejaya by
<>falling into the fire. (A1di Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 6).
<HI>CAKRA II. One of the three attendants given to
<>Subrahman2ya by Vis2n2u, the other two being San3krama
<>and Atikrama. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 40).
<HI>CAKRA III. One of the two attendants presented to
<>Skandhadeva by Tvas2t2a, the other one being Anucakra.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 40).
<HI>CAKRA(M3) I. Sudars4ana Cakra (disc) of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a contains the following story about
<>the origin of the Cakra.
<NI>Su1ryadeva (the Sun God) married Sam3jn5a1, daughter
<>of Vis4vakarma1. But, due to the insufferable heat of
<>her husband the marital life of Sam3jn5a1 became miser- [Page166-b+ 65]
<>able, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat
<>of Su1rya. And, accordingly Vis4vakarma1 ground Su1rya
<>on a grinding machine and thus diminished his efful-
<>gence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of
<>that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the
<>earth, and with that Vis4vakarma1 made the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra, the Tris4u1la, the Pus2pakavima1na and the
<>weapon called S4akti. Out of those four things the
<>Tris4u1la came to be possessed by S4iva, the Pus2paka-
<>vima1na by Kubera and S4akti by Brahma1. The Sudar-
<>s4ana Cakra which was glowing like anything was
<>deposited in the sea. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata as to how the
<>Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna were picnic-
<>ing on the shores of the Yamuna1 Agnideva went to
<>them and requested them to give Kha1n2d2ava forest to
<>him for food. As Taks2aka, friend of Indra, was living
<>in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall
<>there. Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni
<>would be able to consume the forest only after subjuga-
<>ting Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said
<>that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with,
<>and accordingly he meditated on Varun2a, who pre-
<>sented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey
<>as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty
<>of arrows, a bow called Ga1n2d2i1va and the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the
<>other things to Arjuna. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>297).
<HI>CAKRA(M3) II. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 45).
<HI>CAKRADEVA. A warrior born in Vr2s2n2i vam3s4a. (Vr2s2n2i

<>his younger brother is engaged in singing the praise of
<>Kubera. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 27).
<HI>CAKRADVA1RA(M3). A great mountain. Indra per-
<>formed a yajn5a on this mountain. (S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 4, Verse 185).
<HI>CAKRAKA. The son, a Brahmava1din, of Vis4va1mitra.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 64).
<HI>CAKRAMANDA. A na1ga (a serpent). It was this
<>na1ga which was deputed by Ananta (na1ga king) to

<>(Mausala Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<HI>CAKRANEMI1. A woman attendant of Skandadeva.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 5).

<HI>CAKRAVA1N. A mountain very much extolled in the
<>Pura1n2as. When deputing monkeys in quest of Si1ta1,
<>Sugri1va instructed them to make a special search in
<>Mount Cakrava1n. It was on this mountain that Vis4va-
<>karma1 made the Sudars4ana Cakra. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 42, Verse 16).
<HI>CAKRAVYU1HA. A Phalanx.
<NI>A particular pattern of army formation on ground. In
<>the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava war Dron2a1ca1rya formed a Cakra-
<>vyu1ha wherein Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna got himself [Page167-a+ 64]
<>trapped and killed. (Abhimanyu, who forced himself
<>inside the Vyu1ha did not know the method of get-
<>ing out of it which Arjuna alone knew). Cakravyu1ha is
<>made in the form and shape of Cart-wheels. Vya1sa has
<>described the Cakravyu1ha made by Dron2a as follows:--
<>The great preceptor made the Cakravyu1ha and posted
<>in it to maximum capacity kings, who were equal to
<>Indra. In every opening of the vyu1ha were posted
<>princes equal in prowess to the Sun. All the princes
<>were organised compactly. And, all of them wore red
<>uniforms and were adorned with other things also red
<>in colour and held red flags. They also wore golden
<>ornaments and garlands scented with Sandal paste.
<>Ten thousand strong they rushed forward to fight with
<>Abhimanyu. Duryodhana's son, Laks2man2a, led the
<>onrush. In the centre (of the Cakravyu1ha) stood
<>Duryodhana in the company of heroes like Karn2a,
<>Dus4s4a1sana and Kr2pa. And, at the head of the army
<>stood Dron2a, the captain of the army, who looked like
<>the rising sun. Then there was the King of Sindhu,
<>and near him stood As4vattha1ma1, and there stood in
<>front of them thirty Kauravas, all of them equal to
<>Devas. On the flanks were great heroes like S4alya,
<>Bhu1ris4ravas. And then did the battle rage. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 34).
<HI>CAKRIKA. A forest hunter. The following story is
<>told about him in Chapter 16, Kriya1yoga of the Padma
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Devoted much to his parents, Cakrika was a great
<>devotee of Vis2n2u. He used to worship Vis2n2u daily with
<>fruits, (edible) roots etc. But, he did so only after
<>himself tasting them. One day while thus tasting a
<>fruit, somehow or other it got itself lodged in his
<>throat, and all his attempts to dislodge it failed. The
<>fruit had to be, at any rate, offered to Vis2n2u and there-
<>fore Cakrika drew his sword and cut his throat with it.
<>Lord Vis2n2u who was so pleased at such great devotion
<>of the man appeared on the scene and brought him
<>back to life. Sometime afterwards Cakrika expired at
<>the Dva1raka1 temple, and thus attained salvation.
<HI>CAKRODDHATA. A king in the dynasty of Yaya1ti.
<>(Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US I. A synonym of the Sun. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>1, Verse 42).
<HI>CAKS2US II. A tributary of river Gan3ga1. Starting from
<>Vis2n2upa1da (Svarga) the Gan3ga1 falls into Devaya1na
<>and thence into the moon and after flooding the whole
<>area it divides itself into four tributaries, viz., Si1ta1,
<>Caks2us, Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and falls into Brahma-
<>loka and flows in four directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries the river called Caks2us falls on the peak of Mount
<>Ma1lyava1n and then flows through Ketuma1la and falls
<>into the western sea. The Gan3ga1 which flows through
<>India is a branch of the above-mentioned tributary,
<>Alakananda1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US III. A king born in the lunar dynasty. He
<>was the son of King Anudruhyu. (Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2URVARDHANIKA1. A river which flows through
<>S4a1kadvi1pa. (S4a1ka island). (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Verse 33).
<HI>CA1KS2US2AMANU.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The sixth of the fourteen Manus. (See
<>Manvantara). [Page167-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Genealogy.%} Utta1napa1da and Priyavrata were the
<>sons of Sva1yambhuvamanu, and Dhruva was Utta1na-
<>pa1da's son. Dhruva had two sons, S4is2t2i, and Bhavya
<>by his wife S4ambhu. Sucha1ya1, wife of S4is2t2i, had five
<>sons, viz., Ripu, Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2kate-
<>jas. From Br2hati1, wife of Ripu, was born Ca1ks2us2a, the
<>mighty and Ca1ks2us2a begot a son called Manu by
<>Pus2karan2i1, daughter of Vi1ran2apraja1pati and one of the
<>offsprings of Varun2a. This Manu was called Ca1ks2us2a
<>Manu. And Ca1ks2us2a Manu had ten sons by his wife
<>Nadvala1, daughter of Vaira1japraja1pati, called Kuru,
<>Puru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agni-
<>s2t2oma, Atira1tra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Out of
<>the ten, Puru had the following sons by A1gneyi1, viz.
<>An3ga, Sumanas, Khya1ti, Kratu, An3giras and S4ibi.
<>An3ga married Suni1tha1, and Vena was their son. The
<>famous emperor, Pr2thu was Vena's son.
<NI>3) {%Former life.%} The following story is told in the
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a about the former life of Ca1ks2us2a
<>before he was born as Ca1ks2us2a. In that former life he
<>was A1nanda, son of Anamitra. Once a cat carried
<>A1nanda away and laid him on the bed of the child of
<>King Vikra1nta, and the same cat deposited the king's
<>child somewhere else. And, A1nanda grew up as the
<>real son of the King. But, one day he told the King
<>the truth about him and left for the forest for tapas.
<>Brahma1 appeared before him and blessed that he
<>would, in the next birth, be born as the sixth Manu
<>and thus Ca1ks2us2a became the sixth Manu.
<NI>4) {%Chief incidents during his time.%} During Ca1ks2us2aman-
<>vantara were born the famous Nara and Na1ra1yan2a as
<>the sons of Dharma. It was also during this period that
<>Brahma1 was born as Candra, Vis2n2u as Datta1treya and
<>S4iva as Durva1sas from Anasu1ya1, the purest of women
<>and the wife of Atri. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Caturtha
<>Skandha).
<HI>CA1KS2US2I1. An art, the study of which will enable one
<>to see anything in the three worlds. Ca1ks2us2i1 was
<>taught by Manu to Soma, by him to Vis4va1vasu, by
<>him to Citraratha, the Gandharva and by him to
<>Arjuna, son of Pa1n2d2u. (A1di Parva).
<HI>CA1KYA1RKU1TTU. A very important art practised in
<>temples mainly in Kerala. It is called so because it is
<>exhibited by Ca1kya1rs (a sect attached to temples). In
<>important temples a place called Ku1ttambala is set
<>apart for displaying the art. The Ku1ttu now prevalent
<>in Kerala temples is not exactly of its old form. Kula-
<>s4ekharavarma1 peruma1l (elected ruler of old Kerala)
<>effected some changes in the old art form, and Bha1skara-
<>ravivarma1 peruma1l and Tolakavi made further reforms
<>in it. The art of Ku1ttu was evolved with the object of
<>relating pura1n2ic stories in such a manner as will help
<>devotional feelings grow in man.
<NI>The main aim of the Ku1ttu is to narrate pura1n2ic
<>stories in such a way as to instil Bhakti in the hearers
<>and to create an interest in them in the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ca1kya1r (the man who gives the discourse who usually
<>belongs to the Brahmin sect called Ca1kya1rs) tells the
<>story in a very interesting way, reciting appropriate
<>passages from the Pura1n2as and illustrating them with
<>apt examples and similes. The narration is from the
<>beginning till end humorous. The Ca1kya1r who delivers
<>the discourse is usually a man with a good sense of
<>humour and a sense of what is odd, strange or eccentric
<>in nature and human character. There are three varie- [Page168-a+ 65]
<>ties of Ku1ttu: Prabandham3 Ku1ttu, Nam3biar Ku1ttu and
<>Ku1t2ia1t2t2am. Of these the first is narrative (A1khya1na-
<>para) while in the second and third type, the element
<>of acting is more important (Abhinayapara).
<HI>CALA1. Laks2mi1devi1. The following story is told in the
<>Devi1-bha1gavata as to how this name came to be
<>applied to the devi1. Once Revanta the very handsome
<>son of Su1ryadeva came to Vaikun2t2ha riding Uccaih2-
<>s4ravas, Indra's horse. Devi1, who was at that time with
<>Vis2n2u gazed for a few minutes in wonder at the horse.
<>She did not, therefore, attend to Vis2n2u's talk. Angered
<>at this Vis2n2u told the devi1: “Since your eyes find
<>enjoyment on unnecessary things and move about
<>among such objects, you shall be called from today
<>onwards Rama1 and Cala1. Also you will be born as a
<>mare on earth. Accordingly Maha1laks2mi1 was born as
<>a mare on the banks of river Sarasvati1, and regained
<>her old form only after delivering a son by Vis2n2u. That
<>son was Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya kingdom. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 6).
<HI>CAMARA. (CAMARI1). An animal whose tail is its most
<>important and valued organ. In the course of its move-
<>ments in the forest if the tail gets entangled anywhere
<>it is supposed to lie down there till the tail is freed by
<>itself. About the origin of Camara, the following story
<>is told in the Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. Krodhavas4a1, daughter
<>of Daks2apraja1pati and wife of Kas4yapa had ten daugh-
<>ters, viz. Mr2gi1, Mr2gamada1, Hari, Bhadramada1,
<>Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, S4veti1, Surasa1, Surabhi and Kadru1.
<>To Mr2gamada1 the Sr2maras and Camaras owe their
<>origin. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>CA1MARA(M). A rod (handle) with a large tuft of
<>hair, fibre or feathers at the end. A symbol used by
<>kings and brahmins. Ca1mara of the king should have a
<>golden handle, and it should be made of the wings of
<>the swan, the pea cock, the Bala1ka1 bird etc. But, the
<>wings of different birds shall not be intermixed. Circu-
<>lar in shape, the Ca1mara should have on its handle
<>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 sandhis (joints, knots). (Agni-
<>pura1n2a, Chapter 245).
<HI>CAMASA. A yogi, the younger brother of Bharata, a king
<>born in the dynasty of Priyavrata, son of Manu. This
<>country got its name Bha1rata from king Bharata (country
<>ruled by Bharata). Bharata had nine brothers called
<>Kus4a1varta, Ila1varta, Brahma1varta, A1rya1varta, Malaya,
<>Bhadraketu, Sena, Indraspr2k and Ki1kat2a. Bharata had
<>also nine other brothers renowned as navayogi1s, born
<>of another mother. Camasa was one of them, the other
<>eight being Kavi, Hari, Ambari1s2a, Prabuddha, Pippa-
<>la1yana, A1vi1rhotra, Dramid2a and Kharabha1jana. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAMASODBHEDA. A holy place in Saura1s2t2ra which
<>forms part of the very reputed sacred place called
<>Vina1s4ana. It is said that it was here that the river
<>Sarasvati1 which once became invisible, was detected. A
<>bath here is as efficacious as performing the Jyotis2t2oma
<>yajn5a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 112).
<HI>CAMATKA1RA. (See PATTU).
<HI>CAMOHARA. A vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva.
<>Chapter 191, Verse 35).
<HI>CAMPA. A king born in the An3ga dynasty. (See
<>CANDRAVAM3S4A).
<HI>CAM3PA1. (CAM3PA1PURI1). A city on the banks of river
<>Gan3ga1, Cam3pa1 is often referred to in the Pura1n2as4. It
<>was here that Lomapa1da lived in treta1yuga. (M.B. [Page168-b+ 64]
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 113, Verse 15). In Dva1parayuga
<>the city was ruled by a Su1ta called Atiratha, who got
<>Karn2a, while he and his wife were brooding over their
<>lack of a child. In after years Karn2a also ruled the
<>city. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 7).
<HI>CAM3PAKA. A vidya1dhara. Once he visited the banks
<>of river Yamuna1 with his wife Mada1lasa1 when they got
<>from the forest nearby a child. The child in later years
<>became famous as Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya
<>dynasty. (See EKAVI1RA).
<HI>CAMPAKA1RAN2YA. (CAMPA1KARA). A holy place
<>in Northern India. One day's halt at the place and a
<>bath there is considered to be as good as giving away
<>one thousand cows as gift. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 84).
<HI>CA1MPEYA. Son of Vis4va1mitra who was a brahmava1din
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 58).
<HI>CAMPU1. A literary form of presenting a story in a
<>mixture of prose and verse, and abounding in beauti-
<>ful descriptions: “Gadyapadyamayam3 ka1vyam3 Cam-
<>pu1rityabhidhi1yate”. Over and above prose and verse
<>the Campu1s use dan2d2akas (very long, involved and
<>poetical prose). This literary form had its origin
<>first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it
<>with some variations. For instance, though prose in
<>Sanskrit Campu1s is really prose, that in Malayalam
<>is something akin to metrical prose. There are more
<>than two hundred Campu1s in Malayalam. The most
<>famous of the Campu1 writers in Malaya1lam are
<>Punam Namboothiri, Maha1man3galam Namboothiri
<>and Ni1lakan2t2ha.
<HI>CAMU1. A division of an army. (See Aksauhin2i1)
<HI>CA1MUN2D2A1. (See Pa1rvati1).
<HI>CA1N2AKA. The auspiciousness of Ca1n2aka (cowdung) is
<>due to Laks2mi1. (See Laks2mi1, Paras 1 and 6).
<HI>CA1N2AKYA (KAUT2ILYA). The famous author of
<>“Arthas4a1stra” a treatise on political economy.
<NI>Eastern and western scholars have made exhaustive
<>researches on this intellectual giant of ancient India,
<>Ca1n2akya. But, nothing definite has yet been established
<>about his time or life. Indians have accepted as a fact
<>the traditional legend that he was a minister of Candra-
<>gupta, the founder of the Maurya dynasty. It is also
<>firmly believed that it was this mighty intellect of a
<>brahmin who made Candragupta a powerful emperor
<>and steered the ship of his state. The phrase ‘Ca1n2akya's
<>kut2ilani1ti’ (crooked tactics) has become proverbial.
<>Some scholars hold the opinion that he came to be
<>called ‘Kaut2ilya’ because of his Kut2ila (crooked)
<>tactics; but evidence to establish this view-point is yet
<>to be adduced.
<NI>It is his famous Arthas4a1stra, which has made Ca1n2akya's
<>name a world famous one. The great German thinker
<>Jolly has described the Arthas4a1stra as a unique composi-
<>tion in the Sanskrit language. And, Johann Meyer, the
<>great western scholar has the following to say about
<>the book:--
<NI>“Kaut2ilya's Arthas4a1stra is not one single text, it is a
<>collection and collateration of all books in ancient
<>India. To study the greatness of the theories and
<>principles contained in it today requires continuous and
<>constant study at least for twenty years and the un-
<>remitting efforts of a scholar with unabounded know-
<>ledge are required.” [Page169-a+ 65]
<>Even his name has not yet been confirmed beyond
<>doubts. Kaut2ilya is also called Vis2n2ugupta, Ca1n2akya,
<>Dramila, and An3gula. Modern researches place the
<>date of the Arthas4a1stra at near about B.C. 400. In
<>Vis4a1khadatta's Mudra1ra1ksasa (drama) the name
<>Kaut2ilya is used.
<NI>The Authors of Ni1tis4a1stra maintain that the name of
<>the author of Arthas4a1stra was Vis2n2ugupta. It may be
<>gathered from the Mudra1ra1ks2asa that he became famous
<>as Ca1n2akya as he was the son of Can2aka, and that
<>he possessed deep erudition in Ni1tis4a1stra, Dharma-
<>s4a1stra and astrology. There is another legend to the
<>effect that this brahmin (Ca1n2akya) belonged to Ka1n5ci1-
<>pura and that he migrated to Pa1t2ali1putra, the seat of
<>learning and scholarship. As Ka1mandaka, who lived
<>in the fourth century B.C. has eulogised Ca1n2akya in
<>his ni1tis4a1stra it may be surmised that Ca1n2akya lived
<>sometime near about that. Candragupta and Ca1n2akya
<>are referred to in the Vis2n2u and the Va1mana Pura1n2as.
<>Kaut2ilya was keen-eyed and scholar par excellence.
<>“Arthas4a1stra” is a great book written by him after
<>thoroughly examining the viewpoints of previous
<>scholars, and then establishing his own views and
<>theories. From the Das4akuma1racarita of Dan2d2i1 (A.D.
<>700) it may be seen that there are 6000 verses in the
<>Anus2t2up metre (eight letters in one line) in the Artha-
<>s4a1stra composed by Vis2n2ugupta for the use of Candra-
<>gupta Maurya. The Artha a1stra has been held in praise
<>by Ba1n2abhat2t2a who lived in the 7th Century, Soma-
<>devasu1ri, who lived in the 10th century and also by
<>Hemacandra, the author of Ka1vya1nus4a1sana, who lived
<>in the 12th century. The book is a discourse on the
<>principles and practices that are necessary to establish
<>a strong government of an ideal empire. Ca1n2akya has
<>mentioned in his book with respect the old scholars like
<>Manu, S4ukra, Br2haspati, Na1ra1yan2a, Ka1tya1yana and
<>Govinda di1ks2ita. (For the pura1n2ic story about Ca1n2akya
<>see Vararuci, Para 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1. A notorious harlot who lived in dva1-
<>para yuga. When one day at midnight she came to the
<>appointed place to meet a paramour the latter had not
<>arrived. While waiting impatiently there she was
<>attacked and killed by a leopard. Emissaries of Vis2n2u
<>as also of Yama arrived to carry away the soul of
<>Can5cala1ks2i1. Yama's men argued that she had sinned
<>throughout her life, and therefore claimed the harlot's
<>soul. But the emissaries of Visn2u countered the argu-
<>ment thus: “once on her way to conduct her trade
<>Can5cala1ks2i1 got into a temple and munched ta1mbu1la in
<>the course of which she rubbed some lime on the walls
<>of the temple. Taking into consideration this fact of
<>her having spent sometime thus to clean the temple
<>wall her soul deserves to be led to Vis2n2uloka”.
<NI>In the argument the emissaries of Yama were defeated
<>and the soul of Can5cala1ks2i1 was taken to Vaikun2t2ha by
<>the emissaries of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1 II. A vidya1dhara girl. Once while she
<>was concentrating her mind in prayer over Maha1laksmi1,
<>Ra1van2a, King of the Ra1ks2asas, committed rape on her,
<>and she cursed him that he should die on account of
<>Maha1laks2mi1 herself and accordingly at last he was
<>killed by Ra1ma on account of Si1ta1, the incarnation of
<>Maha1laks2mi1. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CAN2D2A. (See Can2d2amun2d2a1s).
<HI>CAN2D2ABALA. A prominent monkey. In the Ra1ma- [Page169-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a war this monkey caused much trouble to Kum-
<>bhakarn2a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 287, Verse 6).
<HI>CAN2D2ABHA1RGAVA. A mahars2i born in the dynasty
<>of Cyavana Muni. A very erudite scholar and deeply
<>versed in the Vedas, it was this mahars2i, who performed
<>Janamejaya's famous Sarpa sattra. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 58, Verse 4).
<HI>CAN2D2AKA. A forest hunter who attained salvation by
<>the worship of S4ivalin3ga. (Phallus of S4iva).
<NI>While once hunting in the woods Can2d2aka saw a S4iva
<>temple in ruins, and the S4ivalin3ga lying on the ground
<>uncared for. This sight greatly grieved him, and he
<>told S4im3haketu, son of the Pa1n5ca1la Ra1ja who happened
<>to come that way all about the temple and the
<>lin3ga. To his query as to whether the s4a1stra permitted
<>a hunter like himself to worship S4ivalin3ga, Sim3haketu
<>answered there were injunctions in the S4a1stras for
<>people like him (Can2d2akas) to instal S4ivalin3ga on
<>rock and then worship it daily, the worshipper wear-
<>ing ashes from the burning gha1t2 on his body. Accord-
<>ingly Can2d2aka installed the lin3ga on a rock and began
<>worshipping it daily along with his wife, Pulindi1. But
<>after sometime there was left no ashes in the burning
<>gha1t2 and Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 discussed between them
<>the means to get ashes for the next day. Then Pulindi1
<>suggested that she should burn herself to ashes and that
<>Can2d2aka should continue worshipping the S4ivalin3ga
<>wearing on his body the ashes. Very unwillingly
<>Can2d2aka agreed with the sad proposal of his wife, and
<>the next day he worshipped the S4ivalin3ga wearing on
<>his body the ashes of Pulindi1. And, at the close of the
<>worship he called aloud for Pulindi1, and lo! wonder
<>of wonders! she stood there before him more healthy
<>than formerly. Moreover a vima1na descended from the
<>skies and conducted both Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 to
<>S4ivaloka. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4am3barama1ha1tyma).
<HI>CAN2D2AKAUS4IKA. A muni, son of Kaks4iva1n, the son of
<>Gautama. Br2hadratha, King of Magadha, was having no
<>issues when, one day, Can2d2akaus4ika went to the palace
<>and blessed the King as a result of which a son called
<>Jara1sandha was born to him. Can2d2akaus4ika continued to
<>live at Magadha for long as the preceptor of the kings of
<>that land. (See Jara1sandha).
<HI>CAN2D2A1LA. (See Ca1turvarn2ya).
<HI>CAN2D2AMAHA1SENA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A very prominent and reputed king of
<>Ujjayini. Va1savadatta1, wife of Udayana was his
<>daughter.
<NI>2) {%The name Can2d2amaha1sena.%} His real name was Maha1-
<>sena. After ascending the throne he began doing
<>tapas to get a noble wife and a good sword. When he
<>cut his own flesh and made an offering of the same to
<>the sacred fire after a long period of tapas the Devi1
<>became pleased, and offered him a sword of exceptional
<>excellence and said that as long as he had that sword
<>with him no enemy would defeat him. The Devi1 also
<>assured him that ere long An3ga1ravati1, daughter of the
<>asura called An3ga1raka and the fairest damsel in the
<>three worlds would become his wife. Since he (Maha1-
<>sena) did the most austere rites and rituals, the Devi1
<>said, he would come to be called Can2d2amaha1sena.
<>Afterwards the sword given by the Devi1 and the ele-
<>phant called nad2a1giri proved as successful and effective
<>to him as were Vajra1yudha and his elephant Aira1vata
<>to Indra. [Page170-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} One day, during a hunting expedition
<>a boar escaped unhurt by the king's arrows and after
<>turning turtle his chariot it went into a cave. The king
<>in great anger followed the pig into the cave, and going
<>forward some distance he saw a beautiful animal where-
<>upon he seated himself on the side of a tank. There he
<>saw, amidst a number of women an exceptionally
<>beautiful woman moving about. Casting her charming
<>eyes glistering with love the woman approached the
<>King. During their conversation, when the king told
<>her about himself she began crying. To the query as
<>to the reason for her crying she answered as follows:--
<>“The boar you saw is my father, An3ga1raka1sura. His
<>body is harder than even diamond, and none can inflict
<>any injury on it. The women you see around are
<>princesses captured by my father from various palaces
<>for my help, and my name is An3ga1ravati1. My father
<>became a Ra1ks2asa as the result of a curse; he is now
<>asleep in the assumed form of a boar. On awaking he
<>is sure to eat you for food, and it was that thought which
<>brought tears to my eyes”. To these words of An3ga1ra-
<>vati1, the king replied as follows:--“If you have any
<>love for me you would go to your father and begin
<>crying when he wakes up, and to his question as to
<>why you are crying you should reply that thoughts
<>about your future in the event of your fathers's death
<>brought tears in your eyes.”
<NI>An3ga1ravati1 agreed to the above proposal of the King.
<>She hid the King in a safe place and went and stood
<>by the side of her father. Everything happened as was
<>anticipated and An3ga1raka consoled his daughter by
<>saying that none would be able to kill him whose
<>body was as hard and strong as diamond, there being
<>only one opening through which he might be struck on
<>the left wrist which might be concealed by the bow.
<>Can2d2amaha1sena who heard the above talk came out of
<>his hiding place and challenged the asura to war. He
<>raised his left hand to show the sign, “just coming,
<>please wait”, and the king then shot his arrow through
<>the opening on his left wrist. The asura fell dead.
<NI>4) {%Birth of Va1savadatta1:%} And, now Can2d2amaha1sena
<>married An3ga1ravati1 and returned to his kingdom with
<>his wife. Two sons, Gopa1laka and Pa1laka were born to
<>the royal couple, and the King celebrated an Indro-
<>tsava for the welfare and prosperity of the children.
<>Pleased at the utsava Indra appeared to the king in
<>sleep and blessed him saying that a daughter would be
<>born to him and that her son would be crowned empe-
<>ror of the Vidya1dharas. Accordingly a daughter was
<>born to the King, and she was called Va1savadatta1.
<>(given by Va1sava, i.e. Indra). Udayana married Va1sava-
<>datta1. (See Udayana).
<HI>CAN2D2AMUN2D2AS. Two brothers born in the Asura
<>dynasty, the elder brother being called Can2d2a and
<>the younger Mun2d2a. These brothers collected, like
<>the other asura leaders Dhu1mra1ks2a, and Raktabi1ja,
<>thousands of soldiers and lived in all pomp and
<>glory.
<NI>During this period two asura brothers called S4umbha
<>and Nis4umbha had returned from the Hima1layas after
<>securing from Brahman a boon that they would meet
<>with their death only at the hands of a woman. Can2d2a
<>and Mun2d2a became their friends and attendants.
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha set out on a triumphal tour
<>and conquered heaven, earth and pa1ta1la. The Devas [Page170-b+ 65]
<>took refuge in a forest. After wandering in the forest
<>for a long time, at the instance of Br2haspati they sought
<>asylum with Pa1rvati1. Pa1rvati1 stood for sometime in deep
<>concentration, and there emerged from her divine body
<>Kaus2iki1 or Ka1li1. Pa1rvati1 assured the Devas that she
<>would kill S4umbha and Nis4umbha. And, then Ka1li1 sat
<>alone on a rock in the thick Forest. Can2d2a and Mun2d2a,
<>who happened to pass that way were attracted by the
<>great beauty of Pa1rvati1 and imparted the news to
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha, and they deputed Dhu1mra1ks2a
<>and 60,000 soldiers to bring Pa1rvati1 over to them; but
<>by one hum3ka1ra (sound ‘hum’) she reduced them to
<>ashes. Ultimately she killed S4umbha and Nis4umbha
<>also. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAN2D2ATUN2D2AKA(S). A son of Garuda. (Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 9).
<HI>CAN2D2AVEGA. A gandharva. (See Puran5jana).
<HI>CAN2D2IKA1. A terrific form of Pa1rvati1, who is worship-
<>ped in temples under the name Can2d2ika1devi1. The
<>Devi1's idol has twenty hands. In the hands on the right
<>side are held S4u1la (three-pronged weapons) sword,
<>Vela (rod), Cakra, pa1s4a (rope), parigha (shield),
<>a1yudha, abhaya, d2amaru and S4akti, while the hands
<>on the left side hold na1gapa1s4a, small parigha, axe,
<>An3kus4a (a long-hooked rod), pa1s4a, man2i, flag, gada1,
<>mirror and an iron cylindrical rod. There are also
<>idols of Can2d2ika1 with ten hands. At the feet of the
<>Devi1 lies Mahis2a1sura with his head severed from body.
<>There will also be standing near the idol a purus2a (man)
<>born from the neck of the Ma1his2a brandishing his wea-
<>pon, and with the S4u1la in his hand in all rage and
<>womitting blood and with red hairs and eyes. That
<>purus2a is bound strongly on his neck with rope. The
<>vehicle of the Devi1 is a lion. The Devi1 is mounted on
<>the lion with her left leg on the asura lying below. This
<>Can2d2ika1devi1 thus stands with weapons in the hand, as
<>annihilator of enemies and with three eyes, and she
<>should be worshipped in pu1ja1man2d2ala with nine Padmas
<>(tantric divisions) along with her idol. Firstly the Devi1
<>should be worshipped in the central padma and Indra
<>and others in the other padmas.
<NI>There is also another Can2d2ika1devi1 (Durga1) with eigh-
<>teen hands. She holds in her right hand a skull, shield,
<>mirror, broom, bow, flag, d2amaru and pa1s4a (cord) and
<>in her left hand rod, iron pounder, S4u1la, Vajra, sword,
<>An3kus4a (a sticklike weapon with one end bent to hold
<>on to things) S4ara (arrow) Cakra and s4ala1ka1. There
<>are nine other Durga1s having the same weapons as the
<>above except the D2amaru and the broom. But, they
<>have only sixteen hands each. These nine Durga1s are
<>called Rudracan2d2a1, Pracan2d2a1, Ugracan2d2a1, Can2d2a1-
<>na1yika1, Atican2d2ika1, and Can2d2ogra1. The Durga1 standing
<>at the centre will have the colour of gorocana (red
<>sandal paste) and the others will have the following
<>colours; arun2avarn2a (red) Kr2s2n2a varn2a (black), ni1la
<>varn2a (blue), s4ukla varn2a (white), dhu1mra varn2a
<>(brown) pi1ta varn2a (yellow) and s4vet2a varn2a (white).
<>The nava Durga1s (nine Durga1s) are installed for the
<>prosperity of children etc. And all these are different
<>forms of Pa1rvati1.
<NI>Also, in various aspects or poses, Pa1rvati1 is called by
<>other names. She is called Siddha1 when installed in
<>Ram3bha1-vana wearing aks2ama1la1 (garland of beads),
<>kiri1t2a (crown) and agni. The same Siddha1 without
<>the fire is called Lalita1. Gauri1devi1 with one of the [Page171-a+ 65]
<>hands on the left side placed on the shoulder and the
<>head, and holding the mirror in the other hand, and
<>holding in one of the hands on the right side fruits etc.
<>and the other hand held up is called Saubha1gya gauri1.
<>(For further details see Pa1rvati1). (Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 50).
<HI>CANDRA I. A prominent asura, also called Candra-
<>varman. It was this asura, as beautiful as Candra (the
<>moon) who was born as the king of Ka1mboja under
<>the name Candravarman (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>67, Verse 31).
<HI>CANDRA II. A king born in the Solar dynasty and the
<>son of Vis4varandhi and father of Yuvana1s4va. See
<>Vam3s4a1vali1)
<HI>CANDRA III. The Pura1n2as declare that Candra was
<>one of the invaluable things got at the churning of
<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi (ocean of milk) Candra, Maha1laks2mi1, Sura1,
<>Uccaih2s4ravas, Kaustubha, Pa1rija1ta, Ka1madhenu,
<>Dhanvantari, Amr2tam and Ka1laku1t2a were the things
<>thus got from the Ocean of Milk. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 18 and Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 9). Also,
<>the evil devata1 called Jyes2t2ha1, Aira1vata, the gem
<>named Cinta1man2i and fair damsels like Ta1ra1 and Ruma1
<>were got from the Ks2i1ra1bdhi, (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a). For general information about Candra,
<>see Grahas).
<HI>CANDRA IV. (CANDRA DEVA).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The child born to Atri by Anasuya1. (See
<>Puru1ravas). In Skandha 4 of the Devi1bha1gavata it is
<>stated that it was Brahman who was born as Candra.
<>(See Atri).
<NI>2) {%Candra led married life with the wife of his guru.%} Ta1ra1,
<>the very beautiful wife of Br2haspati, preceptor of the
<>Devas happened to reach Candra's home during her
<>perambulation one day. Candra and Ta1ra1 fell in love
<>with each other at first sight and lived in conjugal
<>happiness. And thus days passed by. Br2haspati, being
<>informed of the fact on enquiry, deputed his disciples
<>to bring Ta1ra1 back, but to no purpose. Br2haspati sent
<>his disciples again and again to Ta1ra1, but all to no
<>purpose. Then Br2haspati himself went to the house of
<>Candra and invited Ta1ra1, this time also to no purpose.
<>Enraged at this the Deva guru spoke to Candra as
<>follows: “The brahmin-killer, gold-thief, drunkard, he
<>who marries another's wife and he who associates him-
<>self with the above three types are responsible for the
<>most terrible five sins, and you, therefore, are not fit
<>enough to reside in Devaloka. Unless you return my
<>wife to me I will curse you.” None of the threats of
<>Br2haspati could shake Candra. He told the Devaguru
<>that Ta1ra1 who had gone to his house on her own accord
<>would also leave him when she was satiated with him.
<>These words of Candra made Br2haspati all the more
<>angry. He returned home and waited sometime more
<>for Ta1ra1's return. But, he got disappointed, and getting
<>impatient he started again for Candra's house. But,
<>this time the gatekeepers did not let him in.
<NI>Terribly angry at the cruel rebuff Br2haspati sought
<>help of Indra. Indra sent word to Candra asking him
<>to send Ta1ra1 back home or be prepared for war. Even
<>then Candra refused to yield, and Indra started for
<>war against Candra. But, there was somehow some dif-
<>ference among the devas about all this, and the news
<>reached the asuras. At once S4ukra, preceptor of the
<>asuras and an old enemy of Br2haspati met Candra and [Page171-b+ 65]
<>assured him all support in case war broke out between
<>Indra and Candra. He also strongly advised Candra
<>not to return Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati. And, ultimately a
<>fierce war began between Indra and Candra. All acti-
<>vities in the world were thrown into confusion and
<>chaos. At this Brahma1 on his ham3sa (swan) came to
<>the scene and admonished Candra and S4ukra. They
<>could not but obey Brahma1 and so were forced to stop
<>fighting. Moreover, Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2has-
<>pati.
<NI>The quarrel and fighting thus ended for the time
<>being, but another problem cropped up. At the time
<>Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati she was carrying,
<>and Br2haspati was not aware of the fact. And at last
<>Ta1ra1 delivered an exceptionally beautiful male child.
<>The naming ceremony of the child was duly performed,
<>Br2haspati himself acting as its father. When the news
<>reached Candra he sent a messenger to Br2haspati
<>claiming the child was his. Br2haspati too claimed its
<>fatherhood. This controversy developed almost to the
<>brink of a second deva1sura war. At this stage Brahma1
<>went to Br2haspati's house and questioned Ta1ra1 as to
<>who really was her child's father, and she named Candra.
<>Upon this Brahma1 asked Br2haspati to release the child
<>to Candra. Br2haspati did so. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pratha-
<>ma Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Wives of Candra.%} Candra took twentyseven daugh-
<>ters of Daks2a as his wives. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha). These twentyseven wives are the twenty-
<>seven stars. Candra circumambulates Maha1meru along
<>with these, his twentyseven wives (Stars). (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 163, Verse 33). The names of the
<>twentyseven wives are given hereunder: As4vini1, Bha-
<>ran2i1, Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu,
<>Pus2ya, A1s4les2a1, Janakam3, Pha1lguni1, Uttarapha1lguni1,

<>Pracetas, Pu1rvapros2t2hapada1, Uttarapros2t2hapada1,
<>Revati1.
<NI>{%Solar eclipse according to the Pura1n2as.%} The Devas and
<>the asuras jointly churned Ks2i1ra1bdhi wherefrom emerg-
<>ed Dhanvantari with the Amr2takumbha (pot of nectar).
<>(See Amr2tam).
<NI>But an asura ma1ya1vi1 (magician) called Saim3hikeya
<>absconded to Pa1ta1la with the Amr2takumbha which
<>nobody noticed as everybody was busy with dividing
<>other divine objects. Only after the ma1ya1vi1's disap-
<>pearance was it noticed that the Amr2ta Kumbha was
<>missing. At once Maha1vis2n2u assumed the figure of a
<>beautiful woman, got back the Kumbha and gave it to
<>the devas. The devas began drinking the amr2tam when,
<>at the instance of some other devas, Saim3hikeya, the
<>ma1ya1vi1 assuming the form of an old brahmin reached
<>svarga, got a share of the amr2ta and began to drink it.
<>Su1rya and Candra (Sun and Moon) who were on
<>guard at the gates divined the secret of the ‘old
<>brahmin’ and informed Maha1vis2n2u about it. He cut
<>the throat of the pseudo-brahmin with his Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. But, half of the nectar he had drunk stayed
<>above the throat and the other half below it. Therefore,
<>though the head and the trunk were severed they
<>remained alive. These two parts, in course of time,
<>evolved as Ra1hu and Ketu.
<NI>When the throat was cut some blood as well as some
<>amr2ta dropped on two places on the ground, and they [Page172-a+ 64]
<>became the red onion and the white onion respecti-
<>vely. Some vaidika brahmins used to consider the red
<>onion objectionable for consumption as it was evolved
<>from blood, while the white onion was considered
<>usable as it was evolved from amr2tam.
<NI>R2a1hu and Ketu still maintain their hatred for Su1rya
<>and Candra who had betrayed the asura, who, disguis-
<>ed as brahmin tried to drink the amr2ta. Eclipse is the
<>phenomenon of Ra1hu and Ketu swallowing Su1rya and
<>Candra as and when opportunity presents itself for it.
<>But, since the throat is severed from the body, Su1rya
<>and Candra thus swallowed get out through the throat.
<>That is the reason why Su1rya and Candra become
<>visible after the eclipse in over. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a and Bha1gavata As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>5) {%Candra besame Calf.%} Once emperor Pr2thu trans-
<>formed Bha1midevi1 into a cow and milked from her all
<>things and provisions. On that occasion it was Brahma1,
<>who acted as Calf. And, following Pr2thu when the
<>R2s2is milked the cow Candra served as Calf. (For
<>details see Pr2thu).
<NI>6) {%Waxing and waning of Candra, the pura1n2ic story regard-
<>ding it.%} Of the twentyseven daughters of Daks2a whom
<>Candra had married he loved Rohin2i1 much more than
<>the other twentysix wives, and so kept her always with
<>him. This annoyed the twentysix wives, who complained
<>about it to Daks2a. Daks2a's advice to Candra to treat
<>all the wives on an equal footing had no effect on him.
<>So, the twentysix neglected wives again complained to
<>Daks2a as follows: “We shall stay in the a1s4rama and
<>serve you. Soma (Candra) does not associate with us,
<>he will not accept your advice.”
<NI>Though Daks2a warned Candra a second time, that too
<>had no effect on him. So the twentysix wives, for the
<>third time, complained to Daks2a. Daks2a got angry at
<>this and cursed that Candra should suffer from tuber-
<>culosis. Thus Candra was afflicted by consumption.
<>Though Candra performed many a yajn5a to get cured
<>of the fell disease, they did not produce the desired
<>effect. Candra remaining a tubercular patient, the
<>growth of medicinal plants stopped with the result that
<>all living things contracted consumption. When people
<>began becoming thinner, the devas asked Candra for
<>an explanation, and he told them all the details. They
<>then sought the help of Daks2a, who gave Candra
<>redemption from the curse by ordaining that if he dived
<>in the Sarasvati1 ti1rtha in the western sea he would be
<>free from consumption for half of every month. Thence-
<>forth Candra made it a practice to dive in the Saras-
<>vati1ti1rtha and that is the reason why Candra is exempt-
<>ed from Ks2ayaroga for fifteen days. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 35).
<NI>7) {%Candra--King of stars and of medicines.%} During the
<>reign of emperor Pr2thu, he changed Bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow. Later the R2s2is also changed bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow and milked her. It was Candra who served as
<>calf then. Pleased at this Brahman crowned Candra as
<>king of the stars and medicines. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter
<>4, Verse 2).
<NI>8) {%Other information about Candra%}
<NI>(1) Candra is 11,000 sq. yojanas in area, 33,000 yojanas
<>in circumference and a volume of 5,900 cubic yojanas.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12).
<NI>(2) Candra presented two attendants called Man2i and [Page172-b+ 65]
<>Sumati to Subrahman2ya (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45,
<>Verse 32).
<NI>(3) Candra once made a discourse on the superior
<>qualities of brahmins to S4ambara1sura. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 13, Southern Text).
<NI>(4) All welfare and prosperity accrue to him, who on

<>of bread in copper vessels with honey poured into it.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 36, Verse, 13, Southern

<>wife named Manohara1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 18).
<NI>(6) Abhimanyu was Candra's son, Varcas, reborn as
<>the son of Arjuna. (See Abhimanyu).
<HI>CANDRA1. An important river in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 29).
<HI>CANDRAGUPTA I. Second son of Ra1van2a. Once
<>when S4ri1 Ra1ma was King, Candragupta abducted the
<>daughter o! Sugri1va and the daughter-in-law of Vibhi1-
<>s2an2a. Hanuma1n released them both as ordered by S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a Uttara Ka1n2d2a; also see
<>Sahasramukha Ra1van2a).
<HI>CANDRAGUPTA II. A minister of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was once fed sumptuously by Jamad-
<>agni at his a1s4rama with the help of S4us4i1la1, the deva-
<>surabhi (divine cow). Candragupta, at the instance of
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna tried to capture Sus4i1la1 by force, which
<>disappeared immediately in the sky. Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna's
<>servants then forcibly took away its calf. Candragupta
<>thrashed to death Jamadagni, who tried to obstruct
<>their action. (See Ka1rtavi1rya, Para 9).
<HI>CANDRAHANTA1. An asura, who was reborn as King
<>S4unaka. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 677, Verse 37).
<HI>CANDRAHARTA1. A son born to Kas2yapa praja1pati of
<>Sim3hika1, daughter of Daks2a. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65, Verse 31).
<HI>CANDRAHA1SA. Son of King Sudha1rmika of Kerala.
<>The following story about him is told in Jaimini As4va-
<>medha Parva.
<NI>Candraha1sa, born under the star Mu1lam had a sixth
<>finger on the left foot indicative of poverty and of all
<>other evils. And, therefore, on his birth enemies killed
<>Sudha1rmika and his wife followed him soon to the
<>other world. The child thus left an orphan was taken
<>to Kaun2d2alakapuri1 by a female inmate of the palace.
<>But unfortunately the woman died within three years
<>of the above incident. The child, just for very existence,
<>took to begging. After sometime some women jointly
<>took up charge of the boy. Once he went to the house
<>of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, minister of Kaun2d2ala where a feast
<>was in progress. The munis present there were impres-
<>sed by Candraha1sa and prophesied that he would be-
<>come a King. To Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the munis said that the
<>child would guard his wealth. Angry and suspicious at
<>the prophesy of the munis Dhr2s2t2abuddhi asked his men
<>to kill the boy. They led him to the forest. On the
<>way Candraha1sa got a S4a1lagra1ma (a small sacred stone
<>which represented some upadevata1) which he applied
<>very devotedly to his face. They did not in fact kill the
<>boy, but cut off his sixth finger on the left foot and
<>showed it to their master.
<NI>Thus left alive in the forest by the murderers the
<>boy was roaming about when the King af Kalinda on [Page173-a+ 65]
<>a hunting expedition saw the destitute boy, and taking
<>pity on him took him back with him to the palace.
<>The boy was put under the care of Medha1vati1, the
<>King's consort. The king named him Candraha1sa. Since
<>the King took a special interest in the education of
<>the child he became adept in all arts and sciences. At
<>the age of twelve Candraha1sa, with the permission of
<>the king, set out on a triumphal tour, and the king
<>welcomed Candraha1sa on his return after his glorious
<>victory that brought him wealth.
<NI>At the instance of the Kalinda king, Candraha1sa, sent by
<>his messengers tribute to the Kaun2d2ala king, who, under-
<>standing from them that so much of wealth had been
<>brought to the Kalinda king by Candraha1sa started at
<>once for the Kalinda palace. On being told the whole
<>story about Candraha1sa, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the minister of
<>the King of Kaun2d2ala made up his mind to do away with
<>him somehow or other for which he despatched a letter
<>to his son, Madana, through Candraha1sa.
<NI>Candraha1sa on his way to Kaun2d2ala slept on the banks
<>of a river. Campakama1lini1, the daughter of the King
<>of Kaun2d2ala and Vis2aya1, daughter of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi
<>happened to go to the river bank where Candraha1sa
<>was sleeping. Campakama1lini1, who became subject to
<>great love for Candraha1sa removed the anklets on her
<>feet and approached him slowly, and when she took up
<>and read a letter she found lying beside him, she felt
<>awe and sorrow to find therein a suggestion to poison
<>him to death. Without wasting much time in thought she
<>changed the word ‘vis2amasmai’ (give him poison) to
<>‘Vis2aya1smai’ (give him Vis2aya1) and put it in its former
<>place. After some time when Candraha1sa awoke from
<>sleep and reached Kaun2d2ala city and delivered the letter
<>to Madana its content pleased him very much. As for
<>Vis2aya1, she was spending her days in constant prayer
<>that Candraha1sa should marry her. In the cir-
<>cumstances the marriage of Candraha1sa and Vis2aya1 was
<>solemnised on the earliest auspicious day.
<NI>In due course Dhr2s2t2abuddhi returned to Kaun2d2ala with
<>all the wealth he could lay his hands upon after capturing
<>Kalinda. He seethed with grief and rage at the news
<>that Vis2aya1 had been married to Candraha1sa. All the
<>explanations offered by Madana did not satisfy him. He
<>persisted in his determination to kill Candraha1sa.
<NI>The evil-minded Dhr2s2t2abuddhi one day asked Candra-
<>ha1sa to go and worship at the Devi1 temple after having
<>made arrangements for his murder there. But, as fate
<>would have it, it was Madana who, instead of Candra-
<>ha1sa, was killed. Even before the above incident had
<>happened the Kaun2dala King had married his daughter
<>Candrama1lini1 to Candraha1sa, and after relinquishing
<>the kingdom also in his favour the King took to the forest
<>to lead a hermit's life.
<NI>The above developments added fuel to the fire of anger
<>in respect of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, and when he saw in the
<>temple precincts, his son's corpse he became well-nigh
<>mad. Crying out that all this was the result of his having
<>troubled the Vais2n2ava Candraha1sa he dashed his head
<>against the pillars of the temple and died.
<NI>Candraha1sa was grieved over the death of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi.
<>He worshipped Devi1 offering his flesh in the sacrificial
<>fire. Devi1 appeared and granted him two boons which
<>helped him to bring Dhr2s2t2abuddhi and Madana back to
<>life. And, when the Kalinda king and his wife, fearing the
<>wicked Dhr2s2t2abuddhi were about to end their lives in [Page173-b+ 65]
<>flaming fire, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi went to them and imparted
<>to them the secrets about the life of Candraha1sa. The
<>Kalinda king and his wife dropped their former decision
<>to end their life, and Candraha1sa took up the reins of
<>government at the behest of the King. Candraha1sa,
<>who won repute as a very powerful and effective ruler,
<>during the As4vamedha sacrifice of Yudhis2t2hira captured
<>the sacrificial horse, and Arjuna, at the instance of
<>Kr2s2n2a had to enter into a pact with Candraha1sa, who
<>promised him help for the success of the sacrifice. Candra-
<>ha1sa had a son called Makara1ks2a by Vis2aya1 and another
<>son, Padma1ks2a by Campakama1lini1.
<HI>CANDRAHA1SA (M). Ra1van2a's sword. Ra1van2a, in the
<>course of his triumphal tour after receiving the boons
<>from Brahman, subjugated kings, and marching north-
<>ward reached the valleys of Mount Kaila1sa. But, Nandi-
<>kes4vara stopped him there, and Ra1van2a, threatening to
<>throw away S4iva, master of Nandikes4vara along with
<>Kaila1sa, put his twenty hands under it to pull it out,
<>and the great mountain shook violently. Pa1rvati1 got
<>frightened and running upto S4iva embraced him.
<>S4iva, who divined the reason for all these with his eye of
<>supreme knowledge grounded the mountain firmly on
<>earth, crushing Ra1van2a's hands under it. Unable to
<>take away his arms from under the mountain, Ra1van2a
<>remained there for about thousand years singing the
<>praises of the Lord. At last S4iva appeared to Ra1van2a
<>and presented him with a sword called Candraha1sa.
<>It was this sword which won victories for Ra1van2a in
<>future wars. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU I. A son of S4atrughna, brother of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. S4atrughna had two sons. An3gada and Candra-
<>ketu by his wife S4rutaki1rti (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU II. A vidya1dhara King. See Mukta1-
<>phalaketu).
<HI>CANDRAMAS. A r2s2i who imparted spiritual knowledge
<>to Sampa1ti and advised Jat2a1yu to give directions about
<>the way to the monkeys in their search for Si1ta1devi1.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CA1NDRAMASI1. Ta1ra1, the wife of Br2haspati. She fell in
<>love with Candra and lived with him for sometime, and
<>came to be called Ca1ndramasi1. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 219; see also Ta1ra1).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 I. Wife of king Haris4candra reputed for
<>his unique honesty and integrity. (See Haris4candra).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 II. A city. Two sons, Taks2aka and
<>Citraketu were born to Laks2man2a of U1rmila1. Taks2aka
<>was crowned King of Agati, a city built on the eastern
<>coast of the sea after annihilating the hunter tribe there,
<>and Citraketu was crowned king of Candramati1, a city
<>built on the western coast of the sea after killing all the
<>Mlecchas there. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRA1N3GADA. Grandson of Nala. He married
<>Si1mantini1, daughter of Citravarman, a king of A1rya1varta.
<>Si1mantini1, hearing about Candra1n3gada fell in love
<>with him, and it was with the help of Maitreyi1, wife of
<>Ya1jn5avalkya, that she was wedded to him.
<NI>While once Candra1n3gada was enjoying a boat-race in
<>Ka1lindi1 (river) with his friends a storm upset the boat
<>and most of them were drowned to death. The servants
<>of Taks2aka saw Candra1n3gada sinking to the bottom
<>of the river and carried him to Pa1ta1la and he stayed
<>there for sometime in the midst of amorous na1ga damsels.
<>Candra1n3gada's people, under the impression that he
<>had died, performed his funeral rites, and Si1mantini1 [Page174-a+ 65]
<>took to widow's life. Enemies captured his kingdom
<>and imprisoned his father, Indrasena. When once the
<>na1ga King asked Candra1n3gada to marry na1ga girls and
<>settle down in Pa1ta1la he told the King that he was already
<>married and that his wife Si1mantini1 was brooding over
<>him, and he had, therefore, to return to her. Accordingly
<>the na1ga king sent him back with presents of a white
<>horse, a Ra1ks2asa and an infant serpent.
<NI>Candra1n3gada, with his presents, came up in Ka1lindi1
<>where Si1mantini1, grief-stricken was spending her days
<>in penance, and they recognised each other. Informed
<>about the return of Candra1n3gada the enemy kings releas-
<>ed his father from captivity and apologised to him.
<>And he pardoned them.
<NI>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 took great interest in observ-
<>ing somava1ravrata (fasting etc. on Mondays) and pleased
<>at the vrata of the latter S4ri1 Pa1rvati1 blessed her. Two
<>brahmins called Devamitra and Sa1rasvata were living
<>there at the time. Three sons called Sumedha, Sa1rasvata
<>and Sa1mava1n were born to Devamitra. The sons also
<>turned out to be great scholars but they were poor.
<>They could not get brides as they were poor. In the
<>hope that they would get some money if they approached
<>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 the brahmins went to
<>them. After hearing their story the king and his queen
<>conducted them in a procession in the precincts of the
<>palace, Sumedha dressed as husband and Sa1mava1n
<>as his wife. But, lo! when the procession was over
<>Sa1mava1n could not be divested of his womanhood, and
<>Si1mantini1 named her Sa1mavati1. Being told that his
<>son had turned woman Sa1rasvata sought the advice of
<>some munis to remedy the situation. But, all the attempts
<>of the munis to change the woman to man failed, and
<>they opined that only Pa1rvati1, who had been pleased
<>by the Somava1ravrata, would be able to find a solution
<>to the problem. From that day onwards the brahmin
<>youths lived as husband and wife. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Soma-
<>va1ravratam).
<HI>CANDRA1PI1D2A. A son of Janamejaya. Pari1ks2it was the
<>son of Abhimanyu (Arjuna's son). Janamejaya was
<>Pari1ks2it's son. Janamejaya married princess Vapus2t2ama1
<>of Ka1s4i. Two sons called Candra1pi1d2a and Su1rya1pi1d2a
<>were born to the couple. Candra1pi1d2a had hundred sons,
<>who distinguished themselves as great heroes in archery.
<>Satyakarn2a was the eldest among the sons. S4vetakarn2a,
<>son of Satyakarn2a, married Ya1davi1, the daughter of
<>Suca1ru. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA. (See Su1ryaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA1. Mother of the wonderful girl,
<>Somaprabha1. (See Somaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 I. A great sinner, who killed his
<>preceptor. The Padma Pura1n2a relates the story of four
<>sinners named Vidura, Candras4arman, Vedas4arman
<>and Van5jula, who shed their sin by bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1. The sins committed by the four were respectively
<>Brahmahatya1 (killing of brahmin), Guruhatya1 (killing
<>of the preceptor), Agamya1gamana (having sexual con-
<>tact with women like the wife of guru which is debarred)
<>and Govadha (killing of cow) respectively. The leader
<>of the above four sinners was one Vidura of the Pa1n5ca1la
<>des4a. He was begging in the streets without the tuft
<>of hair, the sacred thread and tilaka (mark of sandal
<>paste etc. on the forehead). He went from house to
<>house begging for alms crying thus: “Here is come the
<>man (himself) who committed Brahmahatya1. Please [Page174-b+ 65]
<>give alms to the brahmin-killer who is a drunkard also.”
<>During his begging tour he visited all the ti1rthas also,
<>yet brahmahatya1 stuck on to him.
<NI>While this sinner Vidura, his heart rent with sorrow and
<>remorse, was sitting under a tree, a Ma1gadha brahmin
<>called Candras4arman happened to come there. This
<>brahmin had committed the sin of guruhatya1 (killing the
<>preceptor). He told Vidura:--“While residing with the
<>guru, blinded by desire, I killed the guru, and am now
<>burning myself in the fire of repentance.”
<NI>While they were engaged thus in conversation a third
<>person, called Vedas4arman also came there in an absolu-
<>tely tired condition. He told Vidura and Candras4arman
<>that his relatives and others had cast him out as he once
<>did the sin of agamya1gamana, and by the time he had
<>finished telling his story a Vais4ya called Van5jula came
<>there. Besides drinking liquor he had committed govadha
<>(killing of cow) also. Though these four sinners assemb-
<>led at the same place, they only talked, but did not touch
<>one another, take food together, rest on the same seat
<>or lie on the same bedsheet.
<NI>According to the advice of a Siddha (an evolved soul)
<>the four sinners dived in the holy waters of Gan3ga1 and
<>came out redeemed of their sins. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 91).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 II. A brahmin of Agni gotra from
<>Ma1ya1pura, he was the disciple and son-in-law of Deva-
<>s4arman. Both of them were killed by a Ra1ks2asa while
<>they were gathering darbha (a particular variety of
<>grass used in religious ceremonies) in the forest. Candra-
<>s4arma1 attained Vaikun2t2ha as he was a very righteous
<>person. During Kr2s2n2a1vata1ra (incarnation of Vis2n2u
<>as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a) he was born as Acru1ra. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAS4EKHARA. A King (son of Paus2ya). The
<>following story about his birth is told in the Padma
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Though married for a long time Paus2ya did not have an
<>issue. He began worshipping S4iva to be blessed with a
<>son. S4iva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit
<>which he divided equally among his three wives. In
<>due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the
<>full and complete form of a child the three children had to
<>be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This
<>boy was Candras4ekhara. Thus Candras4ekhara acquired
<>the name Tryam3baka.
<NI>Candras4ekhara married Ta1ra1vati1, daughter of Kaku-
<>tstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the
<>curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhr2n3gi and Maha1ka1la
<>were born to Ta1ra1vati1 in Veta1la yoni and Bhairava
<>yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were
<>sons born to Candras4ekhara himself. (Aurasaputras).
<HI>CANDRASENA I. A king of Sim3hala des4a (Ceylon).
<>Candrasena had two daughters, Mandodari1 and Indu-
<>mati1 by his wife Gun2avati1. Kambugri1va, son of Sudh-
<>anva1, the chief of Ma1dra desired to marry Mandodari1.
<>But, since she preferred unmarried life Kambugri1va's
<>desire did not fructify. Some time later she refused to
<>marry another suitor also, King Vi1rasena of Kosala.
<>Meanwhile the marriage of her younger sister, Indumati1
<>was celebrated, herself having selected Sudes2n2a, the
<>Ma1dra prince at the Svayam3vara as husband. Though a
<>handsome person Sudes2n2a was a philanderer, and one
<>day Indumati1 saw him in bed with her maid-servant.
<>From that day onwards, cutting asunder all marital
<>relationship with Sudes2n2a, Indumati1 went and stayed [Page175-a+ 64]
<>with her father. This story told by Mahis2a1sura to show
<>that women possess only very little discretion occurs in
<>the Pan5cama Skandha of Devi1bha1gavata.
<HI>CANDRASENA II. A king of Ujjayani1 and a great
<>devotee of S4iva. As he performed great sacrifices and
<>gave away money and materials in gift to those who pray-
<>ed for them, an attendant of S4iva called Man2ibhadra
<>once gave him a gem, which possessed supernatural
<>powers. Attracted by the lustre and glare of the gem
<>many kings wanted to purchase it. But Candrasena
<>refused to sell it. Much incensed at the refusal, the enemy
<>kings set out to fight Candrasena, who then took refuge
<>in the Maha1ka1la temple in Ujjayani1 the idol installed in
<>which was S4ivalin3ga. Lord S4iva then appeared to him
<>and granted him salvation. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4aniprado-
<>s2ama1ha1tmyam).
<HI>CANDRASENA III. The Maha1bha1rata refers to another
<>Candrasena, son of Samudrasena, King of Bengal. He
<>was present at the svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 11). Bhi1masena once defeat-
<>ed Candrasena and his father in fight. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 30, Verse 24). After that Candrasena became a
<>supporter of the Pa1n2d2avas. It is stated in Dron2a Parva
<>that in the great war Candrasena fought from a chariot
<>drawn by horses as white as Candra (moon) and got
<>killed by As4vattha1ma1.
<HI>CANDRASENA IV. Another Candrasena, a partisan of
<>the Kauravas, is referred to in the Bha1rata as having
<>fought against the Pa1n2d2avas. His duty was to guard the
<>chariot wheels of S4alya; he was killed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 52).
<HI>CANDRASI1TA1. A female attendant of Skandadeva.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 11).
<HI>CANDRAS4RI1. A woman, who, though actually in love
<>with her husband enjoyed life with her paramour.
<>Candras4ri1 is the heroine of a story narrated in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara to prove that the interest married women take
<>in clandestine relationship is only due to fleeting temp-
<>tations. Candras4ri1 was the wife of a vais4ya called Ba1la-
<>varman, who lived in the city of Pratis2t2ha1na. One day,
<>looking out through the windows in her house she saw
<>the very handsome vais4ya youth called S4i1laha1ra and
<>felt great desire for him. She brought him secretly to
<>the house of her companion and satisfied her desire.
<>When their meeting became a routine affair her relations
<>and servants knew about it. And, her husband alone was
<>unaware of it. Once he became ill with severe fever.
<>Even while he was in his death-bed Candras4ri1 continued
<>her affair with the paramour. When one day she was
<>with her paramour thus, she was told that her husband
<>was no more. At once she took leave of him, returned
<>home and committed suicide by jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of the husband. (Katha1saritsa1gara, S4aktiyas4olam-
<>baka, Taran3ga 2).
<HI>CANDRA1S4VA (M). Son of King Kuvalaya1s4va of the
<>Iks2va1ku dynasty. He had two brothers called Dr2d2ha1s4va
<>and Kapila1s4va. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 24).
<HI>CANDRASVA1MI1. A brahmin, who got back his life by
<>worshipping Su1rya. He stayed with his wife, Devamati1
<>in Kamalapura ruled by King Kamalavarman. A son
<>called Mahi1pa1la was born to him, and at the time of the
<>birth of the child a celestial voice declared that Mahi1pa1la
<>would become King. A few years later a daughter called
<>Candramati1 also was born to Candrasva1mi1. [Page175-b+ 65]
<>During this period, rains having failed, very severe
<>famine stalked Kamalapura. Even the king unmindful of
<>justice and righteousness began extracting from the
<>people whatever they possessed. Finding the situation
<>deteriorated so much Candrasva1mi1 set out for his father-
<>in-law's house with Mahi1pa1la and Candramati1, and on
<>the way they had to cross what was once a wild forest,
<>but which had by then been denuded of green trees or
<>other foliage due to the failure of the rains. The children
<>were severely afflicted by thirst, and so the father, after
<>leaving them at the foot of a tree went in search of water
<>when he was caught by the people of the forest king and
<>taken before him. When he knew that he was about to
<>be given in sacrifice to Devi1 the brahmin folded his
<>hands and prayed to Su1ryadeva, who appeared before
<>him and assured him that not only will death not visit
<>him, but also he would be united with his wife and
<>children.
<NI>The children left under the tree began crying, their
<>father having not returned to them, and a Vais4ya called
<>Sa1rthadha1ra who came that way felt pity for the crying
<>children and took them to his house. One day
<>Anantasva1mi1, a brahmin and a minister of King
<>Ta1ra1na1tha of Ta1ra1pura happened to visit Sa1rthadha1ra.
<>Anantasva1mi1, who had no children of his own took away
<>with him the children from Sa1rthadha1ra.
<NI>One day Su1ryadeva appeared to the forest king in his
<>sleep and asked him not to kill the brahmin (Candra-
<>sva1mi) held captive by him. The very next morning
<>Candrasva1mi1 was released from captivity. Roaming
<>about in quest of his children, Candrasva1mi1 reached the
<>city called Jalapura where he was put up as the guest
<>of a house-holder. One day the host told Candrasva1mi1
<>that a vais4ya called Kanakavarman had, a few days back,
<>told him that he (Kanakavarman) had got two children,
<>one male and the other female from the forest, and taken
<>them to the Na1likera island. The very next day Candra-
<>sva1mi1, along with a vais4ya called Vis2n2uvarman arrived
<>at the Na1likera island, and on enquiry they were told
<>that Kanakavarman, with the children had left for
<>Kat2a1ha island. They then went to Kat2a1ha island only
<>to be told that Kanakavarman had gone to Karpu1ra
<>island. With another Vais4ya Candrasva1mi landed on the
<>Karpu1ra island to no purpose. After thus going to the
<>Suvarn2a and Sim3hala islands too Candrasva1mi met
<>Kanakavarman at Citraku1t2apura. Kanakavarman
<>showed the children to Candrasva1mi, but they were not
<>his. He burst into tears, and returned from Citraku1t2a-
<>pura. He passed on his way back many a temple and
<>city and at dusk reached a big forest. He satisfied his
<>hunger by eating some roots and fruits, and got upon
<>a tree and sat on the top of it. It was mid-night, yet
<>sleep did not oblige him. Then he saw a ma1tr2san3gha
<>(a group of women) consisting of Na1ra1yan2i1 and others
<>come and dance at the foot of the tree. Na1ra1yan2i1 saw
<>Candrasva1mi1 and after the dance was over and her
<>companions had left the place Na1ra1yan2i1 called him down
<>from the tree and gave him a flower. And, according
<>to the advice of Na1ra1yan2i1 the next day morning Candra-
<>sva1mi1 went to Ta1ra1pura where, accidentally he got into
<>the house of Anantasva1mi1, minister of the kingdom, and,
<>for food, repeated vedic hymns. The minister invited him
<>for meals, and there he saw Mahi1pa1la and Candra1vati1.
<>He placed the flower presented by Na1ra1yan2i1 on Mahi1-
<>pa1la's nose whereupon the children recognised him, [Page176-a+ 65]
<>their father. The people celebrated it as a happy day.
<>King Ta1ra1varman gave his daughter, Vasumati1, in
<>marriage to Mahi1pa1la along with half his kingdom.
<>They went to Kamalapura and returned with their
<>mother. All of them spent their days very happily at
<>Ta1ra1pura. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Alan3ka1ravati1 Lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 6).

<>with each other they went to the a1s4rama of the mahars2i
<>where, at his instance, Candra1valoka took the pledge not
<>to kill animals in future, and Kan2va married his daugh-
<>ter to the King. On their way back to the palace the
<>couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which be-
<>longed to a Brahmaraks2as, who caught hold of them,
<>but released them on condition that they gave him in
<>their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they re-
<>turned to Citraku1t2a and told about the incident to
<>minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold
<>equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and
<>a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would
<>be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy

<HI>CA1RUS4RAVAS. (See Ca1rugupta). [Page178-b+ 65]
<HI>CA1RUVAKTRA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. He
<>was much devoted to brahmins. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Verse 71).
<HI>CA1RUVES2A. (See Ca1rugupta).
<HI>CA1RUYAS4AS. (See Ca1rugupta).
<HI>CA1RVA1KA I. A Ra1ks2asa, who was a close friend of
<>Duryodhana. The following story is told about how he
<>happened to become Duryodhana's friend.
<NI>In the Kr2tayuga this Ra1ks2asa did tapas to please Brah-
<>ma1 at Badarya1s4rama, and Brahma1 gave him the
<>boon that he would be safe from all beings. Then he
<>went round the world troubling brahmins, who, at
<>last sought refuge in Brahma1, and he pacified them
<>with the assurance that Ca1rva1ka would become a friend
<>of Duryodhana when he would insult Brahmins and
<>be reduced to ashes in the fire of their anger.
<NI>Accordingly Ca1rva1ka became a friend of Duryodhana.
<>When, after the great war, Dharmaputra entered
<>Hastina1pura with his followers thousands of brahmins
<>gathered around and blessed him. Ca1rva1ka also dis-
<>guised as a brahmin came there and condemning Dhar-
<>maputra as an enemy of his own people cursed him.
<>The brahmins recognised him and cursed him to ashes.
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 38, 39).
<HI>CA1RVA1KA II. Certain Sanskrit texts refer to another
<>Ca1rva1ka, a philosopher in ancient India. He was an
<>atheist. He controverted in a powerful manner the
<>belief in the existence of heaven and hell after death.
<HI>CA1RVA1N3GI1. Wife of King Bhadras4ren2ya and daughter
<>of Kus4a1mba. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<HI>CA1S2AVAKTRA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. He
<>had deep love for brahmins. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 45).
<HI>CATURAN3GA. A king of the An3ga dynasty. He was
<>the son of Hemapa1da and father of Pr2thula1ks2a. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 277).
<HI>CATURAS4VA. A Rajars2i. He was a prominent mem-
<>ber is Yama's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11).
<HI>CATURA1SYA. A heroic asura. Once he fell in love
<>with Rambha1, and on his request Svayamprabha1,
<>Rambha1's attendant, won over her mistress to the asura.
<>The asura, Rambha1 and Svayamprabha1 then shifted
<>their residence to a beautiful palace built in south India
<>by Maya for Catura1sya. But, Indra who felt Rambha1's
<>absence badly came down to earth, killed Catura1sya
<>and took Rambha1 back with him. Indra cursed Svayam-
<>prabha1 to remain on earth. And, he told her that she
<>should welcome and treat well the monkeys who would
<>be arriving there in their quest of Si1ta1, and then she
<>would get redemption from the curse. The above facts
<>were revealed by Svayamprabha1 herself while welcom-
<>ing the monkeys. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CATURDAS4I1MA1HA1TMYA. The pura1n2as declare
<>that worshipping S4iva on Caturdas4i1 day will satisfy all
<>desires. There is a story in one of the pura1n2as support-
<>ing this claim. (See Kumudvati1).
<HI>CATURDAM3S2T2RA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>He always showed great devotion towards Brahmins.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 62).
<HI>CATURIKA1. A harlot about whom the following story
<>is told in Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Once a poor Brahmin got a piece of gold as Pratigraha
<>(fee or daks2in2a1 for performing a religious rite). While
<>he was perplexed not knowing what to do with the gold,
<>a Vit2a advised him to go on tour with the money got by [Page179-a+ 65]
<>selling the gold. The poor Brahmin did not even know
<>how to go on tour. Then the Vit2a advised him to visit a
<>harlot called Caturika1, who lived close by and who,
<>the Vita said, would teach him how to go on tour.
<NI>Brahmin:--What shall I do first after going to the
<>harlot's house?
<NI>Vit2a:--Caturika1 will become friendly if you would
<>give her the gold. Then you should use sweet and charm-
<>ing words, and that is all.
<NI>The Brahmin went immediately to Caturika1's house and
<>he was received honourably by her. Then giving the
<>gold to her he requested her to instruct him about going
<>on tour. This request of his evoked laughter from people
<>around him. Then the Brahmin who was versed in the
<>S4rutis began reciting the Sa1man with his palm formed
<>in the shape of the ears of the cow. All those who were
<>present there wildly laughed at him, and somehow or
<>other he escaped from the none too pleasant scene, and
<>reported his experience at the harlot's to the Vit2a.
<>He very easily understood that the reason for the Brah-
<>min being ridiculed was that misreading his advice to
<>use ‘sa1ma’ (sweet words) the Brahmin recited the sa1ma-
<>veda. He took the brahmin back to Caturika1 and asked
<>her to return the ‘grass’ (gold given her by the brah-
<>min) to ‘the cow’, the Brahmin who was as simple as
<>the cow. Laughingly Caturika1 returned the gold to
<>him. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha Lam3bakam, Ta-
<>ran3ga 6).
<HI>CA1TURMA1SYA. A penance (Vrata) which continues
<>for four months. During this period, the Vedas are to be
<>studied with pure heart. The Pa1n2d2avas did this penance
<>at Gaya1. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 95).
<HI>CATURMUKHALIN3GA. A Brahma lin3ga installed on
<>the northern bank of Sarasvati1 by Brahma1. Brahma1,
<>to start with, created animate and inanimate objects,
<>and was thinking about further creation when a beauti-
<>ful girl, born of herself appeared before him. Brahma1
<>became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbe-
<>coming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his
<>heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahma1, went to
<>the Stha1n2uti1rtha, which washes off all sins, on the north-
<>ern bank of Sarasvati1 and installed his own lin3ga, known
<>as the Caturmukhalin3ga. This installation of lin3ga
<>redeemed him from sins. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 49).
<HI>CATURTHI1VRATA. A fast undertaken so that one
<>may be happy for one year, may achieve all desires and
<>attain S4ivaloka. While observing this fast one should
<>worship Gan2apati on the fourth day after New Moon
<>(Caturthi1) in the month of Makara (February-March).
<>Next day the fast should be broken by eating cooked
<>rice and oil seeds. The Mu1lamantra of Gan2apati is
<>‘gam3 sva1ha1’; hr2daya1dis2ad2an3gas beginning with ‘gam’.
<>‘A1gaccha1tika1ya’ is the a1va1hana mantra and ‘Gaccha1-
<>tika1ya’ the visarjana mantra. Gan2apati should be
<>worshipped with mantras ending with ‘tun3ka1ya’ and
<>beginning with ‘gaka1ra’ as also with offering of sandal
<>paste, rice balls etc. “Om3 Mahotka1ya1ya vidmahe vakra-
<>tun2d2a1ya dhi1mahi tanno danti1 pracodaya1t” is the Gan2es4a
<>ga1yatri1 mantra. He or she who performs the Caturthi1
<>vrata will attain S4ivaloka. If Gan2apati is worshipped
<>on a Tuesday which is also Caturthi1 the devotee will
<>get all his desires satisfied. Caturthi1 occurring in Mi1na
<>(March-April) is called Avighnacaturthi1, and that day
<>fasting should be in the night. On Caturthi1 in April-
<>May Gan2apati should be worshipped with damanaka [Page179-b+ 65]
<>flowers, and then the worshipper will become very
<>happy. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 179). Also see Vina1yaka
<>Caturthi1.
<HI>CATURUPA1YAM. The four means used by Kings in
<>olden times to achieve their objects are called Caturu-
<>pa1yam. Sa1ma, da1na, bheda and dan2d2a are the Catur-
<>upa1yas (four tactics). There are three other upa1yas
<>also, almost equally important as the first four, and the
<>seven upa1yas are collectively called Saptopa1yas. There
<>are also yet other upa1yas, but they are not important
<>enough to merit special mention.
<NI>1) {%Sa1ma.%} It is the best means to attract and convert
<>others to one's side. It consists in winning people with
<>sweet words and looks. People who are friendly by
<>temperament and straightforward may be brought
<>round by sa1ma. Sa1ma is employed in dealing with sons,
<>brothers and other relatives.
<NI>2) {%Da1na.%} There are five kinds or varieties of da1na
<>(gift) viz. pri1tida1na, dravyada1na, svayam3gra1ha, deya
<>and pratimoks2a. If a person gets help from another
<>and acknowledges help by reward that reward is
<>called pri1tida1na. The miser and the poor should be
<>brought round by pri1tida1na. Military captains, heroes
<>and citizens should be won over by this da1na. Those
<>who fall at feet should be honoured by da1na.
<NI>3) {%Bheda.%} Bhedopa1ya is of three kinds: to destroy or
<>end the friendship subsisting between people, to create
<>dissension and to make the parties quarrel with each
<>other. He who is falsely praised, he who does not desire
<>wealth or welfare, he who has been invited to come and
<>then insulted, traitor to king, he who has been exorbi-
<>tantly taxed, the angry one, the honourable one, the
<>insulted, the unreasonably forsaken one, he who har-
<>bours hatred in his mind, the pacified one, one whose
<>wealth and wife have been taken away or stolen, he
<>who has not been respected though deserving of respect--
<>if such people are in one's opposite camp, suspicion
<>should be raked up among them and thus division crea-
<>ted in their ranks. If subordinate chieftains, and forest
<>tribes commit offences they should be brought round
<>by the use of sa1ma and bheda upa1yas.
<NI>4) {%Dan2d2a.%} Dan2d2opa1ya is of three kinds, viz, killing,
<>denuding of wealth, and inflicting pain on the body or
<>torture. Dan2d2a has two other forms, praka1s4a (open)
<>and apraka1s4a (secret). Those who have become objects
<>of hatred to all people should be subjected to praka1s4a-
<>dan2d2a. People, whose killing the world will detest,
<>should not be killed openly, but only secretly. Enemies
<>should be killed with weapons etc. Brahmins should not
<>be killed. Friends and allies should not be subjected
<>to dan2d2a; friends, who are made objects of dan2d2a will
<>wither away like worm-eaten trees. The King, who
<>possesses the three powers (of wealth, army and people's
<>support) and is fully conscious of the time and environ-
<>mental factors should annihilate enemies by the instru-
<>ment of dan2d2a. Evil people should be defeated by
<>dan2d2a itself.
<NI>The upa1ya ma1ya1 consists in practising deception by
<>magic or other yogic powers. The powers can be
<>acquired by the worship of the idols of certain Devata1s.
<>People who employ go about at night in various dis-
<>guises. They disguise themselves as beautiful women or
<>even as animals. They also deceive people by creating
<>illusions of clouds, fire or lightning. For instance, Bhi1ma
<>killed Ki1caka by going to him in the guise of a woman. [Page180-a+ 65]
<>Not to dissuade people who indulge in unjustifiable
<>grief, war etc. is the principal aim of the upa1ya called
<>upeks2a1. Hid2imbi1 gave up his brother Hidimba by
<>practising Upeks2a1. Next is the Indraja1lopa1ya (magic).
<>For example, to create illusions of clouds, darkness, rain,
<>fire, and other magic in order to instil fear among
<>troops of the enemy etc. To scare the enemy is the aim
<>of Indraja1la. (For details of Caturupa1yas see Kan2ika).
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 241).
<HI>CA1TURVARN2YAM. (The four Castes, Classes).
<NI>1) {%General.%} The pura1n2as tell that Brahma1 created the
<>four castes like Brahmins, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas and S4u1dras
<>and assigned to them duties and rules of procedure.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} Brahma1 got ready for the work of Crea-
<>tion, concentrating his mind on the universal soul, the
<>embodiment of Truth. And, the first to be born from his
<>face were people with sublime qualities, and them he
<>called Brahmins. Then emerged from his chest people
<>in whom the heroic or militant qualities preponderated.
<>(Ra1jasa). Them the Creator named Ks2atriyas. Then
<>from his thighs were born people in whom rajas and
<>tamas preponderated, and they were called Vais4yas.
<>And, lastly Brahma1 brought forth from his feet another
<>sect of people, and as tamas (darkness, cultural darkness)
<>preponderated in them they were named S4u1dras. The
<>system of four castes is called Ca1turvarn2yam. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 6).
<NI>3) {%Code of conduct.%} Ahim3sa1 (non-violence), Satyava1da
<>(speaking truth), Bhu1tada1ya (love for all living beings),
<>Ti1rthaseva1 (resort to holy places), Da1na (gifts), Brahma-
<>carya (celibacy), Vimatsaratva (absence of malice),
<>Service of Devas, Brahmins and Gurus (elders), to attend
<>to all dharmas (duties), Pitr2pu1ja1 (worship of elders)
<>eternal loyalty to King, to accomplish objects in con-
<>formity with the injunction of the S4a1stras, not to commit
<>cruel deeds, Titiks2a1 (forbearance, to put up with
<>equanimity the pair of opposites such as pleasure and
<>pain, heat and cold), belief in God--these codes of con-
<>duct are common to all Castes and in all the four stations
<>in life. Now, the special codes for each of the four
<>castes.
<NI>1) {%Brahmins.%} To perform and get performed Yajn5as,
<>to study and to teach the Vedas, to give gifts and to
<>receive gifts--these form the dharma (duties) of the
<>Brahmin. Brahmins take their second birth (dvija)
<>on the upanayana (wearing of the sacred thread).
<>The caste of the mother is the caste of the child. But
<>children born to Brahmins of their non-Brahmin wives
<>are not Brahmins. Children born of a Brahmin woman
<>to a S4u1dra1 are called Can2d2a1las. Sons born of Brahmin
<>women to Ks2atriyas are called Su1tas, and sons born of a
<>Brahmin woman to a Vais4ya are called Vaidehikas.
<>The Brahmin shall not adopt the profession of the other
<>castes. The twice-born are, however, allowed in certain
<>circumstances, the profession of agriculture, protection
<>of cows, commerce and kusi1da (to lend money on inte-
<>rest). But, he shall not trade in gorasa (milk and other
<>cow products) lavan2a (salt) and flesh. If he be an
<>agriculturist, the Brahmin may till the earth, cut medi-
<>cinal plants and destroy pests. But, he must purify the
<>soul by performing yajn5as and worshipping Devas.
<>The soil should be ploughed with eight oxen attached to
<>the plough. He may sustain himself either with R2ta
<>(food got by begging) or Amr2ta (food got not by beg-
<>ging). The suffix “S4arma1” should be added to the names [Page180-b+ 64]
<>of Brahmin children. Upanayana (wearing of the sacred
<>thread) should be done when the child is eight years
<>old. The maun5ji (girdle around the waist) to be worn
<>after upanayana should be made either of mun5ja grass
<>or of the bark of trees. Brahmin brahmaca1rins should
<>wear hides, and when they beg for alms the sentence
<>should commence with the word ‘Bhavati’, e.g. “Bhavati,
<>bhiks2a1m3 dehi). The Brahmin can marry in all the castes,
<>but he shall perform ritual only along with the wife of
<>his own caste.
<NI>{%ii) Ks2atriya.%} To give gifts according to rules, study
<>Vedas and perform yajn5as form the duty of the Ks2atriya.
<>To look after and take care of good people and to punish
<>evil-doers are his especial duties. Names of Ks2atriya
<>children should take the suffix “Varma1”. After upana-
<>yana the child should wear tiger skin. He should carry
<>a dan2d2a (rod) of the Araya1l (peepal) tree. When the
<>Ks2atriya brahmaca1rin begs for alms the word ‘bhavati’
<>should be used in the middle of the sentence, e.g. “Bhiks2a1m3
<>bhavati dehi”. The Ks2atriya can marry in the other
<>castes, except the Brahmin. At the time of wedding the
<>Ks2atriya woman should hold an arrow in her hand.
<NI>{%iii) Vais4ya.%} Agriculture, protection of cows and trade
<>are the special duties of the Vais4ya. Children born of
<>Brahmin women to Vais4yas are called Vaidehikas.
<>Names of Vais4ya children should have the suffix ‘gupta’
<>after them. After upanayana the Vais4ya brahmaca1rin
<>should wear sheep's skin. He should carry a dan2d2a made
<>of a branch of the Ku1vala tree. The Vais4ya may have a
<>wife of his own caste and one of the S4u1dra caste. At
<>the time of wedding the Vais4ya woman should hold a
<>cane in her hand.
<NI>{%iv) S4u1dra.%} Service to the Brahmin and architecture
<>form the duties of the S4u1dra. Children born to Ks2atriya
<>women by S4u1dras are called Pulkasas. Children born
<>to Brahmin women by S4u1dras are called Can2d2a1las,
<>and sons born to S4u1dras by Vais4ya women are called
<>A1yogavas.
<NI>The Can2d2a1la's profession is to hang criminals sentenced
<>to death, and to live by women. The Pulkasa must
<>live by hunting. A1yogava is to act on the stage and live
<>by architecture. The Can2d2a1la should live outside the
<>village. The Can2d2a1la has a right to take the clothes on
<>corpses. He shall not have any physical contacts with
<>the others. He will attain salvation if he died in the
<>course of protecting others. The suffix ‘da1sa’ should be
<>added to his name. He shall marry only from his own
<>caste. (Agni Pura1n2a, 4 Chapters from 151).
<HI>CATURVEDA. One of the Saptapitr2s (seven manes).
<>Vaira1jas, agnis2va1ttas, ga1rhapatyas, somapa1s, Ekas4r2n3gas,
<>Caturvedas and Ka1las are the seven manes. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 47).
<HI>CATURYUGA. (See Manvantara).
<HI>CATUS2KAR2N2I1. One of the female attendants of Skanda-
<>deva. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 25).
<HI>CATUS2PATHARATA1. A female attendant of Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 27).
<HI>CATVARAVA1SINI1. A woman attendant of Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 12).
<HI>CA1VET2T2UPAT2A. (CA1VERU). (Pat2a = army).
<NI>A particular division of the army which in olden days
<>used to come forward to lay down their lives in the
<>service of the country. When defeat in war was almost
<>certain for their king an army division under royal [Page181-a+ 64]
<>leadership was formed of heroes, who took their last
<>leave of their homes and people. The soldiers left their
<>homes with their head and eyebrows shaved, and people
<>gave them a hearty send-off. Either victory or death
<>in battlefield was their slogan. This system originated
<>in Kerala. Imitating Kerala, Turkey and Egypt formed
<>their own division of Ca1vet2t2upat2a in the 15th century.
<>The Ca1vet2t2upat2a of Turkey called the Janissary was
<>formed out of poor Christians captured in war, and that
<>of Egypt called Mamaluk was formed out of slaves.
<>But, the Ca1vet2t2upat2a of ancient Kerala was self-orga-
<>nised out of burning love for their king and country.
<>The families of those warriors of the pata who died in
<>fight were allotted royal favours. Even before, in the 14th
<>century A.D. there existed in Kerala this system of
<>Ca1vet2t2upat2a. From A.D. 1090 to 1111 A.D. many fierce
<>wars were fought between Kerala and the Cola country,
<>and it was perhaps during this period that this system of
<>fighting came into vogue. Certain inscriptions of the
<>period go to prove that Ra1mavarmakulas4ekhara Cakra-
<>varti who ruled Kerala during the above period drove
<>out the Colas from Quilon and captured places up to
<>Kot2t2ar.
<NI>Foreign writers have also referred to the Ca1vet2t2upat2a.
<>“Amouces” and “Amochi” used in the ‘Rise of Portu-
<>guese power in India’ indicate the Ca1vet2t2upat2a. “In
<>the war between Cochin and Calicut in 1504 three
<>princes of Cochin were killed, one of them being the
<>nephew of the ruling monarch. On his death 200
<>Ca1vet2t2u warriors who formed the body-guard of the
<>nephew rushed to the field after shaving their heads
<>and eyebrows and killed all the enemies they saw.”
<HI>CEDI. A king of the Yaduvam3s4a.

<>the Sun heated the head and foot of Ren2uka1 on her way
<>to supply the arrows so fiercely that Ren2uka1 fell down
<>under a banyan tree exhausted. When she became well
<>enough to walk she took the arrows to her husband who
<>was very angry for her being late. She then explained
<>to him how because of the extreme heat of the sun she
<>fell down on the way. Jamadagni then started with
<>increased fury his shower of arrows and the Sun in the
<>disguise of a Brahmin approached and advised him that it
<>was not possible to strike down the Sun because he was
<>a swift-mover in the sky and so it was better to withdraw
<>from that attempt. But Jamadagni said the Sun would [Page182-a+ 65]
<>be stationary for some time at midday and then he would
<>hit the Sun down. When the Sun found that Jamadagni
<>would never drop his attempt he accepted defeat and
<>presented Jamadagni with a pair of sandals and an
<>umbrella to protect against the heat from below and
<>above. From that day onwards footwear and umbrella
<>came into vogue.
<NI>The practice of presenting sandals and umbrella is
<>being carried down from generation to generation and
<>even today it is being followed; these two are given as
<>gifts on the ‘S4ra1ddha’ day. (Chapters 95 and 96, Anus4a1-

<>previous birth by this name. (See Matan3ga).
<HI>CHATRAKETU. The second son born to Laks2man2a
<>of his wife U1rmila1. The eldest son was Taks2aka. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma after his return from the exile established a
<>Kingdom called Agati on the eastern sea-shore and
<>crowned Taks2aka as the King of that place. On the wes-
<>tern side after subjugating the mlechhas (low-caste

<>called Candramati1 and installed Chatraketu as the King
<>of that country. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<HI>CHA1YA1. A substitute of Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4va-

<>became unbearable to her and so she created a substitute
<>in her exact form and leaving her to look after Su1rya,
<>her husband, she left the place and went to her father.
<>Su1rya did not know of this replacement and taking her
<>to be Sam3jn5a1 he produced three children by her, S4ani,
<>Sa1varn2amanu and Tapati1. Cha1ya1 loved her sons more
<>and this made Yama angry and he raised his legs to
<>strike her when Cha1ya1 cursed that Yama's legs would fall
<>off from his body. Yama complained to his father and he
<>amended the curse and said that only some flesh from
<>his limbs would fall to the ground and that flesh would
<>serve as food to the germs in the earth. Yama would
<>escape from further injury. After consoling his son he
<>turned towards Cha1ya1. The anger of Su1rya frightened
<>her and she told him everything. Su1rya then divorced
<>her and brought back Sam3jn5a1. For details see Sam3jn5a1.

<>were born from the body of Nandini1, the cow, during
<>her fight with Vis4va1mitra. (S4loka 38, Chapter 174,
<>A1di Parva). These low-caste people paid homage to
<>Yudhis2t2hira and gave him many presents. (S4loka 31,
<>Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CINTA1MAN2I. A diamond. This was salvaged from the
<>ocean of milk along with other precious items like

<>(Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CIRADA1TA1. There was a king called Cirada1ta1 in the
<>country called Cirapura. Though himself a good man he
<>was surrounded by bad advisers. Once a foreigner,
<>Prasan3ga, came along with two friends to the palace to
<>see the King. But due to the bad advice of his courtiers
<>the King did not care to see them even. For five years
<>they stayed there without even getting a look at the
<>King. One day the only son of the King died. All the
<>courtiers gathered round the child and pretended to
<>be greatly grieved. Prasan3ga and his friends also came
<>to the scene. They saw the king and spoke to him thus:
<>“For five years you have not cared either to see or talk to
<>us. We were cherishing a hope that at least your son
<>would give us a better treatment when he grew old and
<>became King. We were living here on that hope and now
<>that hope also has been shattered and so we are leaving
<>the place this instant.” The King was surprised to hear

<>Chapter 8, Karn2a Parva).
<HI>CIRAKA1RI1. A son of Gautama Mahars2i. He used to
<>think deeply before doing any deed and so he earned the
<>name Ciraka1ri1.
<NI>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the
<>chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded
<>his son Ciraka1ri1 to chop off the head of the latter's
<>mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the
<>forest and Ciraka1ri1 in obedience to his father's order
<>came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not
<>kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences
<>of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then
<>again who would be there to look after father if mother
<>died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might
<>regret his command and come back repentant. Thus
<>he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full
<>of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife [Page183-a+ 63]
<>alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and
<>he blessed Ciraka1ri1. (Chapter 266, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>CIRAN5JI1VI1. The name of a crow, a character in the

<HI>CI1RAVA1SAS II. A yaks2a. He stayed in the court of
<>Kubera worshipping him. (S4loka 10, Chapter 10,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CIRA1YUS. An ancient King of the country Cira1yu.
<>Na1ga1rjuna was a minister of this King. Na1ga1rjuna knew
<>the secret of ‘Rasa1yanasiddhi’. Once Na1ga1rjuna pre-
<>pared a medicine for himself and the King which if
<>taken would keep them eternally young. They took
<>medicine accordingly.
<NI>After some days a child of the minister died. Grief-
<>stricken Na1ga1rjuna decided to prepare Amr2ta which
<>would eradicate death from this world. He had pre-
<>pared it but there remained one more medicine to be
<>added to this. The auspicious moment to add the same
<>was to come only after five days and Na1ga1rjuna waited.
<>The devas were frightened. If Amr2ta was made avail-
<>able on earth men would become Devas. Devas could
<>not bear this and so they sent the As4vini1kuma1ras to
<>the earth to persuade Na1ga1rjuna to desist from his work
<>of preparing Amr2ta. Further they informed him that his
<>dead child was living happily in heaven. He agreed to
<>stop his work.
<NI>After some time Cira1yus crowned his son Ji1vahara as the
<>heir-apparent. Overjoyed Ji1vahara ran to his mother
<>Dhanapara1 to give her the glad tidings. Dhanapara1
<>told her son thus: “My child, why should you be so
<>happy to think that you have become the heir-apparent.
<>Several sons of your father had already become yuvara1jas
<>and died before becoming King. Your father has taken
<>a medicine from Na1ga1rjuna and that will keep him
<>eternally young. None of his sons can aspire to be the
<>King. Your father is now eight hundred years old and
<>will live long. Many of you will become yuvara1jas but
<>not the King. I will therefore suggest a way to tide over
<>this difficulty. Everyday in the afternoon Na1ga1rjuna
<>would come outside the palace and enquire whether
<>anybody is in need of anything. At that time he would
<>give whatever was asked for. It is an opportunity when
<>you can ask for his head. When Na1ga1rjuna is dead your
<>father would either die of grief or go to the forests.
<>Then you can become the King.”
<NI>Ji1vahara was pleased to hear this suggestion and he went
<>that after-noon to the palace of Na1ga1rjuna and when
<>Na1ga1rjuna as usual came out with his query Ji1vahara
<>asked for his head. Most willingly Na1ga1rjuna offered
<>his head to be chopped off. But the effect of the medicine
<>made even the strongest cut by the sword ineffective.
<>Ji1vahara lost many swords without Na1ga1rjuna getting
<>even a small scratch on his neck. The hubbub brought
<>the King to the scene and he immediately asked Na1ga1r-
<>juna to withdraw his head but Na1ga1rjuna refused saying,
<>“Oh, King, in my ninetynine previous births I have
<>offered my head like this and please do not ask me to
<>desist from making this offer for the hundredth time”. [Page183-b+ 65]
<>So saying he embraced the King and taking a powder
<>from his body smeared it on the sword and asked Ji1va-
<>hara to strike again. This time very easily Ji1vahara
<>severed the head from the body of Na1ga1rjuna. The
<>King was greatly aggrieved and he renounced all and
<>went to the forest and led a pious life.
<NI>Cira1yus' son Ji1vahara became King. But Na1ga1rjuna's
<>sons killed him and his mother died of grief. (Taran3ga,
<>Ratnaprabha1 Lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>CI1RIN2I. A river. It was on the banks of this river that
<>Vaivasvata Manu clad in bark-skin and with knotted
<>hair did penance. (S4loka 6, Chapter 187, Vana Parva).
<HI>CITAL. (Termites). Cital has got its own place in the
<>pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata has the following story about
<>the origin of it.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u once looking at the face of Laks2mi1 laughed
<>without any apparent reason. Laks2mi1, thinking that
<>Vis2n2u was laughing at her and that he had an eye on
<>some other woman more beautiful than her lost her
<>temper and cursed Vis2n2u that his head would be severed
<>from his body.
<NI>No sooner was the curse pronounced than the asuras came
<>in batches fully armed and challenged Vis2n2u to war.
<>Single-handed the Lord fought the asuras with one bow.
<>The fight did not end though it continued for thousands
<>of years. Vis2n2u felt tired and decided to rest awhile.
<>He planted one end of the untied bow on the ground,
<>rested his chin on the other and sat in Padma1sana.
<>Being very tired the Lord remained asleep for a long
<>time in this posture.
<NI>About this time the devas made preparations to perform
<>a yajn5a. All the devas except Maha1vis2n2u attended that
<>yajn5a. Since he was the master of yajn5as performed for
<>purposes of the devas they could not begin it in his
<>absence. So, Brahma1 and others went in search
<>of Vis2n2u to Vaikun2t2ha. But he was not to be found there.
<>Then Brahma1 and others found out with their
<>eyes of knowledge where Vis2n2u was and they went to
<>the place where he was sleeping. They waited there
<>for a long time, yet Vis2n2u did not awake from sleep.
<>Then Brahma1 hit at a plan to awaken Vis2n2u. It was
<>to create citals (termites) to eat the end of the bow.
<>When they had eaten away the end of the bow
<>planted on the ground the cord binding the two ends
<>of it would break, the bow would straighten up and the
<>speedy movement of it would awaken Vis2n2u.
<NI>According to this plan Brahma1 created citals, but his
<>other plans were not acceptable to the citals. They
<>argued that the advantage of awakening the Lord from
<>sleep would go only to the devas, while its sin would
<>fall upon them.
<NI>They argued,
<Poem>Nidra1bhan3gah2 katha1chedo
<>Dampatyoh2 pri1tibhedanam /
<>S4is4uma1tr2vibhedas4ca
<>Brahmahatya1samam3 smr2tam //</Poem>
<F>*) To disturb one in sleep, to interrupt a story, to separate husband and wife as also mother and child from each other--these things
<>are tantamount to Brahmahatya1 (killing of the brahmin).</F>
<>Brahma1 conceded the justness of this argument and
<>agreed that, in future, a part of the result of yajn5as
<>shall go to citals. It was after this that havis (sa crificial
<>offering) which, in the course of being submitted to the
<>fire falls on the sides of the pit of fire became the share
<>of citals (termites). This promise of Brahma1 pleased the
<>the citals, and they did as was bidden by Brahma1 and [Page184-a+ 65]
<>the bow of Vis2n2u straightened up with a terrific sound.
<>The devas were terror-stricken, the whole universe
<>shook, the earth experienced a convulsion and the oceans
<>too were shaken. Moreover, the head of Vis2n2u was
<>severed from the body, rose high up in the sky and fell
<>into the sea. Brahma1, S4iva and others opened their eyes
<>only to find the body of Vis2n2u lying thus without the
<>head.
<NI>This loss of Vis2n2u's head proved to be useful in another
<>way. Now, Hayagri1va, after securing the boon from
<>Brahma1 that he would be killed only by one with horse's
<>head, was running rough-shod over the whole earth.
<>The devas cut off the head of a horse and attached it to
<>the trunk of Vis2n2u. Thus Vis2n2u came to life again, and
<>according to his orders the citals gnawed away the cord
<>of Hayagri1va's bow as a result of which he was killed.
<>(Devi1ma1ha1tmya, Prathma Skandha).

<>The boy immediately stood up and told An3giras that

<>days immersed himself in concentrating the mind on
<>God was turned into a Gandharva; his wife too turned

<NI>And, both of them rose up in the sky and flying over
<>Mount Kaila1sa looked down to the mountain. There they
<>saw Pa1rvati1 being seated on the thighs of S4iva at which

<HI>CITRA1N3GADA1 II. A wife of Arjuna.
<NI>{%General information.%} When once Dharmaputra was
<>closeted with Pa1n5ca1li1 in amorous talks Arjuna by mis-
<>take entered the room and was thus compelled as per
<>a previous mutual agreement to go on a pilgrimage for a
<>year. During this exile he married the serpent girl
<>Ulu1pi1. After that he proceeded again on his pilgrimage
<>and reached a state called Man2alu1r. Man2alu1r was then
<>reigned by a King called Citrava1hana. Citra1n3gada1
<>was the daughter of Citrava1hana.
<NI>An ancestor of Citrava1hana greatly grieved by the lack
<>of a son, did great penance to propitiate S4iva and S4iva
<>blessed him and said that in future he and his successors [Page185-b+ 65]
<>would get a son to keep their line unbroken. Accordingly
<>all the forefathers of Citrava1hana got a son each but
<>when it came to the turn of the latter he got a girl
<>instead.
<NI>Arjuna accidentally saw Citra1n3gada1 and fell in love with
<>her, and knowing that, the king received Arjuna in his
<>palace and requested Arjuna to marry his daughter.
<>Arjuna married her and the couple got a son named
<>Babhruva1hana. Promising them that he would come
<>back and take them to Hastina1pura Arjuna continued
<>his pilgrimage. (Chapters 219, 220, and 221, A1di
<>Parva).
<NI>2) {%How Citra1n3gada1 came to Hastina1pura.%} When after the
<>great epic battle Dharmaputra conducted an As4va-
<>medhayajn5a it was Arjuna who led the sacrificial horse
<>to the south. When Arjuna came to Man2alu1r he came
<>against Babhruva1hana who challenged him for a fight.
<>In the grim battle that ensued Arjuna fell dead by the
<>piercing arrows of Babhruva1hana, his own son. At that
<>time Ulu1pi1 and Citra1n3gada1 came to the scene and
<>seeing Arjuna lying dead, Ulu1pi1 brought the diamond,
<>Mr2tasan5ji1vani1, and placing it on Arjuna's face brought
<>him back to life. (See Babhruva1hana for details).
<>After this incident all of them, Citra1n3gada1, Ulu1pi1 and
<>Babhruva1hana went to Hastina1pura along with Arjuna.
<>(Chapters 79 to 81, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>3) {%Other details%}
<NI>(1) Citra1n3gada1 on reaching Hastina1pura bowed down
<>before Kunti1 and Pa1n5ca1li1 touching their feet and lived
<>amicably with others like Subhadra1. (S4loka 2, Chapter
<>88, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(2) Kunti1, Subhadra1 and Pa1n5ca1li1 gave Citra1n3gada1
<>many diamonds as present. (S4loka 3, Chapter 88,

<>as a servant-maid. (S4loka 23, Chapter 1, A1s4ramava1sika

<NI>(4) Citra1n3gada1 was one among the women who wept
<>when at the fag end of their life Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 started for Vanava1sa (life in the forest).
<>(S4loka 10, Chapter 15, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>(5) Citra1n3gada1 was a beautiful woman having an
<>enchanting figure as that of a Madhu1ka flower. (S4loka
<>11, Chapter 25, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>(6) After the Maha1prastha1na of the Pa1n2d2avas Citra1n3-
<>gada1 left for Man2ipur. (S4loka 18, Chapter 1, Maha1-
<>prastha1nika Parva).
<HI>CITRA1N3GADA1 III. Daughter of Vis4vakarma1. Once
<>while she was bathing in a pond along with her compa-
<>nions in the forest of Naimis4a Prince Suratha, son of
<>Sudeva, came that way. Seeing him Citra1n3gada1 told her
<>companions “This beautiful young man is in love. I
<>must give myself to him”. Though her companions
<>objected to her doing this, waving aside the objections
<>Citra1n3gada1 approached Suratha.
<NI>When Vis4vakarma1 knew about this he was extremely
<>angry and cursed her saying that she would never have
<>a marriage. Citra1n3gada1 fainted when she heard the
<>curse and her companions tried their best to wake her
<>up, but failed. They then took her to be dead and left
<>the place in search of firewood and other things to
<>conduct a funeral.
<NI>When Citra1n3gada1 woke up she looked around for her
<>companions and finding none including her lover, the
<>prince, she ran and threw herself into the river, Sarasvati1. [Page186-a+ 64]
<>That river pushed her down to river Gomati1 and that
<>river in turn washed her ashore a huge forest. There
<>she was met by the sage R2tadhvaja. Knowing her
<>sad tale the sage felt compassion for her and cursed
<>Vis4vakarma1 to be born as a monkey. Then he let her
<>marry her lover and blessed them. (Chapters 63 and
<>64, Va1mana Pura1n2a).
<HI>CITRA1N3GI1. Daughter of Bhadras4ren2ya, a king of
<>Hehaya. She was the wife of Durmada. (See under
<>Durmada).
<HI>CITRAPUS2PAM. A garden where peculiar kinds of
<>flowers grow. This garden is on the higher planes of

<>Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>CITRARATHA I. (AN3GA1RAPARN3A). A devagan-
<>dharva.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Citraratha was the gandharva son of
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife Muni. (S4loka 43, Chapter
<>65, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Citraratha and Arjuna.%} The greatest event in the
<>life of Citraratha alias An3ga1raparn2a was the defeat he
<>suffered at the hands of Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas after
<>their escape from the lac palace (La1ks2a1gr2ha) through
<>a tunnel arrived in a forest and there they killed the
<>demons Hid2im3ba and Baka. One night they were
<>walking along the shores of the river Gan3ga1 when they
<>heard a sound of somebody bathing in the river. Arjuna
<>who was walking ahead waving a country torch went
<>to see who was bathing at that time of the night. Arjuna
<>then saw Citraratha enjoying a bath with his wife
<>Kumbhi1nasi1. That period of the night was allotted to
<>the gandharvas, and human beings were not expected
<>to be out walking at that time. Citraratha felt it
<>impertinent that Arjuna a human being should be out
<>walking at night and peep into the privacy of the
<>gandharvas. The gandharva and Arjuna so entered into
<>a combat. Citraratha who was a great fighter was,
<>after a grim battle, subdued, bound hand and foot, and
<>brought before his brothers by Arjuna. Kumbhi1nasi1
<>followed her exhausted, powerless and spiritless husband
<>and pleaded to Dharmaputra to release him. Dharma-
<>putra advised Arjuna to do so and on getting his release
<>he taught Arjuna the famous Ca1ks2us2i1vidya1--the magic
<>art of seeing by one's own eyes anything and everything
<>in the three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether-
<>world. Manu was the author of this magic art and from
<>him Soma learnt it and from Soma Vis4va1vasu, from
<>Vis4va1vasu, Citraratha and from Citraratha, Arjuna.
<>Besides this Citraratha gave Arjuna many chariots
<>and horses.
<NI>In return Arjuna taught him the secret of the missile
<>Agnis4ira. Exchanging faith and affection thus Citraratha
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas became friends. He then narrated to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas many interesting stories, of which the
<>following are a few. The story of the feud between
<>Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra, story of Tapati1sam3varan2a
<>and tales about the sage Para1s4ara, Kalma1s2apa1da,
<>Adr2s4yanti1, Bha1rgavas, Kr2tavi1rya and Aurva. Citra-
<>ratha advised the Pa1n2d2avas to have a priest for the
<>sacrificial rites and it was thus that they engaged
<>Dhaumya as their family priest.
<NI>Since Arjuna had destroyed all the chariots belonging to
<>Citraratha, the latter got a name ‘Bhagnaratha’ (devoid
<>of chariots). Citraratha admitted that Arjuna could [Page186-b+ 65]
<>conquer him because of his vow of celibacy. (Chapters
<>165 to 183, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Citraratha attended one of the birthday festivals of
<>Arjuna. (S4loka 52, Chapter 122, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(2) Citraratha worshipped Kubera sitting in the latter's
<>council. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 10, S4loka 26).
<NI>(3) He offered as a gift to Dharmaputra four hundred
<>excellent horses which could fly like wind. (Chapter 52,
<>S4loka 23, Vana Parva).
<NI>(4) When the gandharvas milked the earth during the
<>time of the emperor, Pr2thu, Citraratha acted as the calf.
<>(S4loka 39, Chapter 6, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>(5) S4iva once sent Citraratha as a messenger to Asura

<>abandon his satanic activities. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Nava-
<>ma Skandha).

<HI>CITRARATHA III. A king of Sa1lva. Once Ren2uka1,
<>wife of Jamadagni, after her bath in the river stayed
<>ashore watching this king and his queen bathe in the
<>river with erotic plays. Ren2uka1 thus reached the a1s4rama
<>a bit late and Jamadagni enraged at this commanded
<>his son Paras4ura1ma to chop the head of his own mother.
<>(Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 59).
<HI>CITRARATHA IV. A king of the dynasty of Bharata.

<HI>CITRARATHA VII. A king of the Ya1dava dynasty.
<>He was the son of Us4an3ku and father of S4u1ra. (S4loka 29,
<>Chapter 147, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>CITRARATHA VIII. Son of Vi1raba1hu and a friend of
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma. In the Ra1jya Ka1n2d2a of A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a
<>there is the following story about him.
<NI>Citraratha was also one among those assembled for the
<>svayam3vara of Hema1, daughter of Kus4a. He sent an
<>anaesthetic missile to the assemblage and made them
<>all fall down senseless. He then took Hema1 out from the
<>marriage hall. But on reaching outside he felt he had
<>done a very unjust thing and so withdrew the missile
<>and stood outside ready to fight. A fight ensued in
<>which Citraratha defeated all. But Lava alone continued
<>to fight with him. Vi1raba1hu, father of Citraratha, who
<>was closely watching the fight came to the help of Citra-
<>ratha and engaging Lava in a fight struck him down.
<>Kus4a seeing this attacked Vi1raba1hu and bound him
<>hand and foot. At that time S4ri1 Ra1ma came to the scene
<>and told Kus4a that Vi1raba1hu was a friend of his and
<>set Vi1raba1hu free. Hema1 was then married to Citra-
<>ratha and Vi1raba1hu was sent away with due respect.
<HI>CITRARATHA. An Indian river of pura1n2ic fame.
<>(Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).

<HI>CITRAS4ARA1SANA. (S4ARA1SANA, CITRACA1PA). One
<>of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. In the great battle he was
<>killed by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 20, Chapter 136, Dron2a

<HI>CITRASENA I. A gandharva. There is reference to
<>this gandharva in many places in the pura1n2as. He had
<>two wives Sandhya1vali1 and Ratna1vali1.
<NI>1) {%How Arjuna saved him.%} Once when Citrasena with
<>his wives was travelling in the aerial car the spittings of
<>Citrasena fell upon the sage Ga1lava who was doing his
<>sandhya1 rites then. The sage complained about the
<>incident to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who promised to bring to him the
<>head of Citrasena before sun-set. Sage Na1rada informed
<>Citrasena of this vow of Kr2s2n2a. The gandharva was
<>taken aback and did not know what to do. But Sandhya1-
<>vali1 and Ratna1vali1 went and sought the help of Subhadra1.
<>They made a fire pit in front of her house and decided
<>to end their lives along with Citrasena by jumping into
<>the fire. While Citrasena was circling the fire-pit be-
<>fore jumping into it his wives wept loudly and hearing
<>the noise Subhadra1 came out and saw what was happen-
<>ing. They then took from Subhadra1 a boon to the effect
<>that they should be allowed to live with their husband.
<>It was only after granting them the boon that Subhadra1
<>understood the whole situation. Subhadra1 was in a
<>fix but Arjuna assured her that Citrasena would be
<>protected at any cost. Arjuna very cleverly shielded all
<>the arrows sent against the gandharva by Kr2s2n2a and
<>gradually the fight came to be one between Arjuna and
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Subhadra1 came between them and it was
<>found difficult to continue the fight. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a advised
<>Citrasena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava.
<>Citrasena obeyed and the issue settled without harm to
<>both the parties.
<NI>2) {%Arjuna defeats Citrasena.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>in exile, Duryodhana knew through a spy that they
<>were camping in the Dvaitavana forest. Prompted by
<>Karn2a Duryodhana programmed to go to Dvaitavana
<>with his retinue to enjoy the sight of the suffering Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas. So they started to the forests under a pretext of an
<>annual stock-taking of the cows. They reached Dvaita-
<>vana with a huge army. There they split into parties
<>and roamed about making merry by themselves. Soon
<>one of the parties reached a pond near the hermitage of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. They saw a few gandharvas making
<>merry in the pond. With the usual haughtiness they
<>commanded the gandharvas to leave the pond and make
<>room for Duryodhana to come and bathe. The gandhar-
<>vas did not pay heed to their words and on being inform-
<>ed of this Duryodhana went to fight with the gandhar-
<>vas. It was Citrasena who led the gandharvas and by
<>his incessant shower of piercing arrows split the Kaurava
<>forces and made them flee for life. Duryodhana was
<>isolated from his army, was bound hand and foot and
<>taken a prisoner. In their sheer helplessness they approa-
<>ched Dharmaputra in his hermitage and acquainted
<>him with the pitiable plight of Duryodhana. Dharma-
<>putra asked Arjuna to go to the help of the Kauravas.
<>Arjuna faced Citrasena in a grim combat. Citrasena
<>then appeared in his real form and Arjuna knew that
<>he was fighting a friend. Then at the request of Arjuna
<>Citraratha released Duryodhana. (Chapters 239 to
<>243, Vana Parva).
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) This gandharva occupied a seat
<>in the court of Yudhis2t2hira along with twentyseven other [Page187-b+ 65]

<>at times. (S4loka 22, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(4) At the invitation of Indra Arjuna went to devaloka
<>and Citrasena taught him dance and music. It was
<>during this visit that Arjuna threw a cold blanket on the
<>amorous approaches of Urvas4i1 and was consequently
<>cursed by her to be an eunuch. It was through Citrasena
<>that Indra sent word to Urvas4i1 to console Arjuna and
<>give relief from the curse. (Chapters 45 and 46, Vana

<>Vrata there. Before them was a heap of rice and

<>was a sin to take food on that day of Vrata and then there
<>came a change in the mind of the King and he readily
<>agreed to observe the As2t2ami1rohin2i1 vrata and did so.
<>Because of this when the king died, though a great
<>sinner he was, he was taken to heaven by the servants

<NI>The King on returning to his palace started a Vais2n2ava-
<>sattra. (An almonry dedicated to Maha1vis2n2u). This
<>almshouse was as comfortable and luxurious as the
<>one once started by Brahma1 in the temple of Gaya.
<>Vis2n2uda1sa on the other hand spent his life in a Vis2n2u
<>temple leading a celibate life and observing rites pleas-
<>ing to Vis2n2u.
<NI>One day after finishing his daily morning rites Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa cooked his food as usual and kept it in its place
<>to be taken later. But on returning to it after some
<>time he found his food eaten by someone else. He
<>went without food that day and it happened the next
<>day also. It continued to happen thus for a week and
<>all these days Vis2n2uda1sa went fasting. Vis2n2uda1sa
<>then decided to watch and see who the thief was.
<>On keeping a vigil he found a Can2d2a1la (a harijan of
<>the lowest Cadre) timidly coming and grabbing at
<>the food with gluttonous greed to appease his hunger.
<>Seeing the famished skeletonous body of the thief Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa felt compassion rather than resentment and calling
<>him back to take the food went after him crying “Hi,
<>come here and take this ghee also with you. That food
<>has no fat in it.” But the Gan2d2a1la frightened at the
<>sight of the owner of the food ran away as fast as his
<>legs could carry him, Vis2n2uda1sa following him. But
<>soon the Can2d2a1la fell fainting on the road exhausted and
<>tired. Vis2n2uda1sa reaching his side started fanning him
<>with his cloth. Very soon the Can2d2a1la changed
<>himself into Maha1vis2n2u adorned with S4am3kha, Cakra
<>and Gada1 and Vis2n2u embracing his devotee took him
<>to Vaikun2t2ha.
<NI>Hearing this Cola called Mudgala the priest of the
<>Vais2n2avasattra, to his side and lamented “I started
<>this sattra to spite Vis2n2uda1sa and now he has gone to [Page189-a+ 65]
<>Vaikun2t2ha. It was due to his true devotion to God
<>that he has attained salvation. What we have done
<>is of no use.” So saying he crowned his nephew as
<>King. Even while young he had become an ascetic and as
<>such had no sons. From that time the crowning of
<>the nephew as King became a precedent in Cola.
<>Renouncing the kingdom Cola went to the sacrificial
<>hall and circling the sacrificial fire stood before it and
<>addressing Mukunda said “Oh Vis2n2u, grant me un-
<>wavering devotion to you in thought, speech and deed.”
<>Repeating this three times the king jumped into the
<>fire. At this Mudgala, the priest, burst into anger and
<>tore off the lock of hair on his head. So even today
<>the decendants of Mudgala do not have hair-locks.
<>Vis2n2u who is always affectionate to his devotees graci-
<>ously appeared from the sacrificial fire and embraced
<>the King. The King was then taken to Vaikun2t2ha.

<HI>CU1T2U. (Dice). It is an imaginative paura1n2ic assump-
<>tion that there is a satanic force latent in dice, hunting,
<>wine and women. There is a story to support the pre-
<>sence of this evil power within the above four. Indra
<>once turned the As4vini1devas out of his court labelling
<>them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discon-
<>tented at this the As4vini1devas approached Cyavana and
<>the latter performing a ya1ga invited the As4vini1devas and
<>gave them the ya1ga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this
<>Indra raised his celebrated Vajra1yudha (Weapon of
<>thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic
<>powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from
<>the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra.
<>Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana
<>and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into
<>four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine
<>and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as
<>destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>CYAVANA. A celebrated sage of the Bha1rgava dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Brahma1--
<>Bhr2gu--Cyavana.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Bhr2gu is the son of Brahma1 born of Agni at the
<>Brahmayajn5a conducted by Varun2a. The beautiful and
<>virtuous lady Puloma1 was the wife of Bhr2gu. Even be-
<>fore Bhr2gu married her she was being loved by the demon
<>Puloma1 and her marriage with Bhr2gu embittered him
<>and he waited for an opportunity to kidnap Puloma1.
<NI>One day when Bhr2gu went to the river for his bath
<>Puloma1 entered the a1s4rama and there he found his love
<>Puloma1 being watched over by Agni. Puloma1 compelled
<>Agni to tell him the truth whether Bhr2gu had married
<>Puloma1 according to the rites enjoined by the scriptures.
<>Agni confessed that it was not so and then Puloma1
<>taking the shape of a hog carried away Puloma1 who was
<>then in a stage of advanced pregnancy. On the way the
<>wife of the sage delivered and the babe dropped to the
<>ground. Because the babe was born with a fall (Cyavana)
<>from the womb the boy was named Cyavana. The
<>radiance of the boy burnt the demon into ashes. Puloma1
<>weeping profusely with tears rolling down her cheeks
<>returned to the a1s4rama. Her tears ran into a river and the
<>river got the name Vadhu1sara1 Bhr2gu on knowing how all
<>happened cursed Agni saying that Agni would thereafter
<>be an all-round eater. (eating anything and everything).
<>(Chapters 5 and 6, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Penance and marriage.%} Even when he was very
<>young Cyavana commenced practising austerities.
<>He went to the forests and sat in meditation without food
<>or sleep, oblivious to what happened outside. Years went
<>by and Cyavana did not stir from his place. Gradually
<>earth began to cover him and soon he was completely
<>enveloped by earth. Creepers grew on it and birds made
<>rests; Cyavana did not know anything about it. [Page190-a+ 65]
<>One day S4arya1ti with his wives and children came to
<>that forest for a picnic. Sukanya1, daughter of King
<>S4arya1ti, along with her companions separated from the
<>King and roamed about in the forest making merry.
<>They soon came to the place where Cyavana sat doing
<>penance. There was an unusual radiance around the
<>heap of earth they saw there and Sukanya1 out of curiosity
<>started striking down the earth. Then from inside came
<>Cyavana's voice advising her not to crumble down the
<>earth as she was doing. Sukanya1 ignored the advice and
<>searched for the source of the voice. She then saw two
<>points of glow and taking a thorn gave two pricks at
<>those points and left the place with her companions.
<NI>Those glow-points were the eyes of Cyavana and Cya-
<>vana felt insufferable pain when his eyes were thus pierced
<>through. But he neither became angry nor cursed the
<>girl who did this havoc. Cyavana went on with his
<>penance. But soon the country of S4arya1ti began to expe-
<>rience the bad effects of this evil-deed. People one by one
<>in the beginning and then the whole lot were disabled
<>from passing either urine or faeces. From men and
<>women the disease spread to the animals also. The country
<>was in a chaos and the subjects flocked to the palace to
<>complain to the King. S4arya1ti knew that somebody must
<>have in a some way tormented Cyavana and enquired
<>of each and everyone of his subjects. Whether anybody
<>had knowingly or unknowingly given pain to Cyavana.
<>Nobody had done so and the King was worried. Then
<>Sukanya1 ran to her father and confessed what she had
<>done. The King ran immediately to the place where
<>Cyavana was doing penance and striking down the earth
<>prostrated before the sage who was sitting there sad and
<>miserable. The King apologised to Cyavana and reques-
<>ted him to pardon his daughter.
<NI>Cyavana then told the King that it was enough if he
<>gave his daughter in marriage to him in expiation of the
<>harm done. The King was shocked to hear this for
<>Cyavana was not only ugly but now blind also. The
<>King returned to the palace sad and worried and there
<>was gloom over the whole palace. But Sukanya1 approa-
<>ched her father and agreed to be the wife of Cyavana.
<>The problem was solved and the King with great reluc-
<>tance took his daughter to the forests and gave her in
<>marriage to Cyavana.
<NI>4) {%Cyavana attains eternal youth.%} It was the time when
<>Indra had banned Somapa1na (drinking of the ya1ga wine)
<>to the As4vini1devas. Discontented at this they roamed
<>about in the forests and soon came to the neighbourhood
<>of the a1s4rama of Cyavana.
<NI>Sukanya1 after becoming the wife of Cyavana did all she
<>could to make her husband comfortable and happy.
<>She would collect very sweet and tasty fruit from the
<>forests and give him. She would bathe him in hot water.
<>After arranging all the materials needed for the morning
<>rites like yava, sesame, darbha and water, she would
<>take her husband to the place of the pu1ja1 leading him
<>by hand. When the morning pu1ja1 was over she would
<>seat him in a suitable place and give him rice and fruits.
<>After the meals she would give him pan to chew. Only
<>after doing all these would she go to do her daily rites
<>and that too only after obtaining her husband's permis-
<>sion. She would finish her routine in no time to come
<>back to her husband to see whether he was in need of
<>anything. Then she would make arrangements for the
<>evening pu1ja1 and after the pu1ja1 was over she would give [Page190-b+ 65]
<>him his dinner. She would eat only what was left by
<>her husband. At night she would spread a soft bedding
<>and lull him to sleep. Then she would take a nap lying
<>at the foot of her husband. During summer she would
<>fan him and during winter she would make fire to give
<>him heat. Early morning she would take him to a dis-
<>tant place for his excretion and after washing him would
<>seat him in a suitable place for cleaning his teeth and
<>face. Then the routine would start with great devotion
<>again.
<NI>One day Sukanya1 was returning from the river after her
<>bath and on the way she came across the As4vini1devas.
<>They were astounded to see such a beautiful damsel in
<>the forest and they accosted her and requested her to
<>select one of them as her husband. Knowing her identity
<>they advised her to forsake her old and blind husband and
<>come and live with one of them. She flew into a fury
<>when she heard her husband spoken of so slightingly
<>and by logical argument convinced them the error of
<>their request. Then they told her thus: “You are aware
<>we are the physicians of the devas. We can give back
<>eyesight to your husband and make him as beautiful
<>as one of us. We will then appear before you as three
<>lovely young men identical in appearance and then you
<>must select one among the three as your husband.”
<NI>Sukanya1 was immensely pleased as well as surprised to
<>hear the offer and was eager to see her husband young
<>and beautiful. But the last condition frightened her.
<>Anyhow she promised to give a reply after consulting her
<>husband and ran to the a1s4rama to tell her husband the
<>news. Cyavana advised her to accept the offer of the
<>As4vini1devas and Sukanya1 ran back to the As4vini1devas
<>and brought them to her husband accepting their terms.
<>The As4vini1devas took the aged and blind Cyavana along
<>with them to the river nearby and the three plunged into
<>the river. When they rose up after a dip the three emer-
<>ged as young, lovely and charming triplets difficult to be
<>distinguished from one another. When Sukanya1 stood
<>before the three to select her real husband she prayed to
<>her goddess and the Devi1 gave her the power to identify
<>Cyavana and so she correctly chose him from the three.
<>(Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Cyavana defeated Indra.%} Immensely pleased at re-
<>gaining his eyesight and youth Cyavana asked the As4vini1-
<>devas what they wanted. The As4vini1devas replied that
<>Indra had banned wine to them and they would like to
<>have the ban lifted. Cyavana Mahars2i immediately
<>commenced a Somaya1ga to which were invited all the
<>devas and the As4vini1devas also. When Indra saw the
<>As4vini1devas standing to partake of the Soma wine he was
<>furious and objected to the wine being given to them.
<>Cyavana dissented and a fight ensued between Indra and
<>Cyavana. Indra raised his weapon ‘Vajra1yudha’ to
<>strike at Cyavana and then Cyavana made all his limbs
<>go stiff. He then raised from the sacrificial fire a fiendish
<>demon called Mada to kill the devas. All those present
<>were frightened by this demon and they ran away. But
<>Indra could not run for his limbs were stiff. Standing
<>there he prayed to his preceptor Br2haspati for help and
<>Br2haspati advised Indra to surrender to Cyavana. Indra
<>bowed his head before Cyavana and prayed to be ex-
<>cused. Cyavana was pleased and withdrawing the demon
<>tore him into four pieces and threw one each into Dice,
<>Hunting, Wine and Women. The devas and As4vini1devas
<>then went back to heaven. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 [Page191-a+ 64]
<>Bha1gavata. R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 17, Su1kta
<>116; Chapter 123, Vana Parva).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Paras4ura1ma once came and stayed at the a1s4rama of
<>Cyavana. At that time Bhr2gu and Cyavana were in the
<>a1s4rama. They blessed him and advised him to go to
<>Kaila1sa and do penance there to propitiate S4iva. It was
<>thus that Paras4ura1ma happened to go to Kaila1sa to do
<>penance there. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 62).
<NI>(2) Cyavana got a son named Pramati. This Pramati
<>was the father of Ruru and the grandfather of S4unaka.
<>(Chapter 5, A1di Parva).
<NI>(3) Cyavana married A1rus2i daughter of Manu. Aurva
<>was the son born to A1rus2i from her thigh. In descending
<>order from Aurva were born R2ci1ka--Jamadagni--
<>Paras4ura1ma. (Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<NI>(4) A1sti1ka learnt Sa1n3ga Vedas from the a1s4rama
<>of Cyavana. (Chapter 48, A1di Parva).
<NI>(5) Cyavana was the guru of Bhi1s2ma. (S4loka 11,
<>Chapter 37, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(6) King Yuvana1s4va once went to the a1s4rama of Cyavana
<>greatly worried over the lack of a descendant. Cyavana
<>prepared some sacred water made potent with the recital
<>of mantras to induce gestation and kept it there. Acci-
<>dentally the King drank that water and got pregnant.
<>The pregnancy developed without miscarriage and in due
<>time the King gave birth to a child, the left side of his
<>stomach bursting forth to push out the child. It was this
<>child who became Ma1ndha1ta1. (Chapter 126, Vana
<>Parva).
<NI>(7) Cyavana was a brilliant member of the court of
<>Brahma1. (S4loka 11, Chapter 22, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(8) Cyavana went to Pa1ta1la (nether-world). (See under
<>Kekaralohita).
<NI>(9) Once the august Vedas4arma1 of Kaus4i1kagotra went
<>to the a1s4rama of Cyavana lost in thought. Cyavana recei-
<>ved him with due respect and enquired about the reason
<>for his sorrow. Vedas4arma1 then told him that the lack of a
<>son worried him much. Cyavana then blessed him and
<>assured him of a child soon. (Chapter 14, Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>(10) Cyavana had a daughter named Sumanas and she
<>was married to a sage called Somas4arma1. (Chapter 14,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CYAVANA1S4RAMA. A sacred place. Am3ba1, daughter
<>of Ka1s4ira1ja, used to bathe in a pond nearby. (S4loka 26,
<>Chapter 186, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>CYAVANASAROVARAM. A sacred place. It is believ-
<>ed that this is the best place for worshipping Pitr2s
<>(spirits of the dead). (S4loka 11, Chapter 125, Vana
<>Parva).
<H>D
<HI>D. ({#qa#}) This letter means (1) Rudra and (2) tremor
<>or fear (tra1sa).
<HI>DA. This syllable means ruin. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>348).
<HI>DABHI1TI. A hermit who is praised much in the R2g-
<>veda. It is mentioned in R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka
<>16, Su1kta 112, that the As4vini1devas had saved Turvi1ti,
<>Dabhi1ti, Dhvasanti and Purus2anti, the sons of Indra,
<>from a danger.
<HI>DADHI1CA. (DADHI1CI).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} A famous hermit. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that
<>this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhr2gu, and [Page191-b+ 64]
<>that he was made of the essences of the world, with a
<>huge body.
<NI>2) {%The birth of the hermit Sa1rasvata.%} Dadhi1ca erected his
<>hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvati1 and began
<>to do penance. The power of penance increased daily.
<>Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial
<>maid Alam3bus2a1 to break the penance of Dadhi1ca some-
<>how or other. Alam3bus2a1 came to the hermitage of
<>Dadhi1ca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit
<>saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred
<>to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvati1, who be-
<>came pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child.
<>She took the child to the hermit Dadhi1ca and told him
<>the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased.
<>He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river
<>Sarasvati1 thus:--
<NI>“Brahma1, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased
<>if your water is offered as oblation.”
<NI>Dadhi1ci then said that the child should be named Sa1ras-
<>vata. He also added that when there was a drought conti-
<>nuously for twelve years, Sa1rasvata would have the
<>power to bring rain. Then Sarasvati1 took the child to
<>her abode and brought it up.
<NI>3) {%How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.%} Once
<>Dadhi1ci went to the world of the devas (gods).
<>From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with
<>the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could
<>not. So he made a search for anything left behind by
<>Dadhi1ca. He understood that Dadhi1ca had with him
<>the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country
<>of S4aran2ya. With the bones taken from that head Indra
<>and Dadhi1ca destroyed a large number of asuras.
<>(R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 13, Su1kta 84).
<NI>4) {%The weapon%} (Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone.
<>A story occurs in the Maha1bha1rata, which says that the
<>Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of
<>Dadhi1ci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the
<>leadership of Vr2ttra1sura. Indra tried his utmost to kill
<>Vr2ttra1sura, but he could not. At last Indra approached
<>Brahma1, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit,
<>called Dadhi1ca was obtained it could effectively be used
<>against Vr2tra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara
<>and Na1ra1yan2a to the banks of the river Sarasvati1 and
<>entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining
<>hermit Dadhi1ca and informed him of their errand. The
<>hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his
<>bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded
<>his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhi1ci and made his
<>weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vr2tra
<>and his followers. (Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 100).
<NI>5) {%Other information%}
<NI>(1) At the sacrifice of Daks2a, Dadhi1ci got angry because
<>S4iva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 284).
<NI>(2) Once Dadhi1ci talked to a Bra1hmin called Karun2a
<>about the importance of the ashes dedicated to S4iva.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 101).
<NI>(3) See Dhanan5jaya V to know how this hermit gave
<>absolution from curse to a fly.
<HI>DADHI1CA(M). A holy place in Kuruks2etra. An3giras
<>the son of Sarasvati1 was born in this place. From that
<>day onwards this place became a holy place. It is men-
<>tioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83,
<>Stanza 186 that he who bathes in this holy place will [Page192-a+ 66]
<>obtain the fruits of performing the sacrifice As4vamedha,
<>and enter the world of Sarasvati1.
<HI>DADHIMAN2D2ODAKA. An ocean. This ocean is near the
<>ocean Ghr2toda samudra (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 12, Stanza 2).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA I. A famous serpent, born to Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati by his wife Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 35, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA II. A famous monkey. This old mon-
<>key was the general of a huge monkey-army. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<>283, Stanza 7 that this general approached S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>once, with his army.
<HI>DADHIVA1HANA. An ancient king of Bha1rata. The
<>hermit Gautama saved the son of this King from the
<>attack of Paras4ura1ma (Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 49, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIVAKTRA. A monkey who helped S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>It is seen in Adhya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 5, as follows:--
<NI>“Dadhimukhah2 Kruddhasugri1vasya ma1tulah2”. From
<>this it is understood that Dadhimukha or Dadhiva-
<>ktra was the uncle of Sugri1va. (For further infor-
<>mation see Madhuvana).
<HI>DADHYAN3.
<F>1) The stories regarding the two hermits Dadhici and Dadhyan3 in the Pura1n2as are not very clear. In Maha1 bha1rata Dadhi1ca is men-
<>tioned as the son of Bhr2gu, and in R2gveda it occurs that Dadhi1ca was the son of Hermit Atharva who was the son of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Moreover the story of Dadhyan3 teaching the As4vini1devas the ‘Madhuvidya1’ is connected with Dadhici in some other pura1nas
<>Some statements in the R2gveda make it difficult to assume that both Dadhyan3 and Dadhi1ci are one and the same person. So relving
<>on the majority of statements in the various pura1n2as this book has accepted the fact that these hermits are separate persons and that
<>Dadhi1ci was the son of Bhr2gu whereas the hermit who taught Madhuvidya1 to the As4vini1devas was Dadhyan3.</F> A hermit. Once Indra taught this
<>hermit Madhuvidya1 (the art of mead) Indra told the
<>hermit that his head would be cut off if he taught any-
<>body this art. The As4vini1devas approached Dadhyan3
<>to learn this art. Fearing Indra the hermit refused to
<>teach them the art. As4vini1devas cut off his head and
<>buried it in a place. Then they cut off the head of a
<>horse and fixed it on the neck of Dadhyan3. Having
<>the head of the horse he taught the art to the As4vini1-
<>devas. When Dadhyan3 had finished teaching, they

<NI>1) {%Two Daks2as.%} In most of the Pura1n2as references
<>about two Daks2as occur. In some pura1n2as both are
<>referred to as one and the same person, whereas in
<>some others both are considered as separate persons,
<>so much so the stories concerning both are interlocked
<>and entangled very often. The fact is that there was
<>only one Daks2a, whose life was of two stages. The first
<>Daks2a was killed at the sacrifice of Daks2a, at which point,
<>ends the first stage, or the first Daks2a. The second stage
<>was the rebirth of the same Daks2a. A short biography
<>of Daks2a including both stages is given below:--
<NI>Brahma1 created by his mind, the seven great hermits,
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha and
<>Kratu. So these seven hermits are called the Ma1nasa-
<>putras (sons born from mind) of Brahma1. After this,
<>from the anger of Brahma1, Rudra was born, and from
<>his lap Na1rada, from his right thumb Daks2a, from
<>his mind the Sanakas and from his left thumb a daughter
<>named Vi1ran2i1 were born.
<Poem>Vi1ran2i1 na1ma tasya1 stu
<>asikni1tya1pi sattama1</Poem>
<NI>From this passage which occurs in Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a it
<>may be assumed that ‘Asikni1’ was another name of
<>Vi1ran2i1. Daks2a did penance in the mountain of Vindhya
<>for a long time. It is mentioned in Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>8, that Maha1vis2n2u appeared before Daks2a and gave
<>him Asikni1 as his wife.
<NI>Several sons were born to Daks2a by his wife Asikni1.
<>The last one was a daughter named Sati1 who became
<>the wife of S4iva. At this time Daks2a performed a sacrifice.
<>As he was not invited to that sacrifice, S4iva sent
<>Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1 and killed Daks2a. Though
<>the devas put the head of a goat in place of the lost
<>head and brought Daks2a to life again, no reference
<>is made about the life of Daks2a after the sacrifice. Thus
<>the first stage of the life of Daks2a ends. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 7).
<NI>After this, once the Pracetases (the ten sons of Barhis)
<>were engaged in penance and the earth was not pro-
<>perly cultivated in consequence of which big trees [Page193-a+ 65]
<>grew up and the whole of the earth was changed into
<>a big forest. The sky was covered with tree tops. It
<>was difficult even for the wind to pass through them
<>and thus the forest thrived for ten thousand years. The
<>pracetases got out of the sea after penance and entered
<>the shore. When they saw the big forest they got angry
<>and the ten of them discharged fire and wind from
<>their faces. The wind up-rooted the trees and the fire
<>dried them. Thus almost the whole of the trees were
<>consumed. Then Candra, the King of the medicinal
<>herbs came there and told the Pracetases “Oh, Kings,
<>hold your anger. I will make the trees conclude a
<>treaty with you. The beautiful Ma1ris2a1 who was born
<>to the trees is my foster-daughter. I give her to you
<>as your wife. From half the portion of your minds
<>and half the portion of my mind the great and wise
<>praja1pati Daks2a is going to take birth in her womb”.
<NI>The Pracetases controlled their anger and accepted
<>Ma1ris2a1 as their wife, at the words of Somadeva (Candra)
<>and as the son of the ten pracetases the Praja1pati Daks2a
<>was born. With this the second stage of the life of Daks2a
<>begins. The important occurrences in the two stages
<>of the life of Daks2a are given below in their order.
<NI>2) {%Daks2a's creation of the prajas or subjects.%} Once Brahma1
<>called Daks2a and ordered him to create praja1s or sub-
<>jects. Accordingly Daks2a created the gods, the hermits,
<>the Gandharvas (Demi-gods), the Asuras, the serpents
<>etc. Seeing that the subjects he created were not pro-
<>liferating as required he thought of creating subjects
<>by coition of male and female; and he begot by his
<>wife Asikni1 five thousand sons, and they were called
<>Haryas4vas. They in their turn were about to create
<>subjects when Na1rada appeared before them and said
<>“Oh, Haryas4vas, you are mere children and ignorant
<>of the secrets of this world. How do you intend to
<>create subjects? You fools, since you have the power
<>to go up and down and lengthwise and breadthwise,
<>why don't you try to find out the extremities of the
<>earth?” Hearing the words of Na1rada, they all ran
<>in different directions and have not returned since.
<>Thus Daks2a lost the Haryas4vas. Daks2a again begot
<>thousand sons by Asikni1 and they were called S4abala1s4vas.
<>Seeing that they also were about to create subjects
<>Na1rada scattered them also, by some tricks. The
<>S4abala1s4vas who had gone to see the end of the earth
<>have not yet returned.
<NI>Daks2a got angry with Na1rada and cursed him thus:
<>“You also, like my children shall wander from place
<>to place all over the earth”. From that dry onwards
<>Na1rada became a wanderer, without a fixed dwelling
<>place. The wise Praja1pati Daks2a again begot sixty
<>damsels by Asikni1. Ten of the girls were given to Dharma-
<>deva, thirteen of them to Kas4yapa, twentyseven of
<>them to Soma, and four of them to Aris2t2anemi. Of
<>the rest two were given to Ba1huputra, two to An3giras
<>and two to the wise Kr2s4a1s4va. The names of the wives
<>of each are given below:--
<NI>(1) {%Kas4yapa.%} Aditi, Diti, Danu, Aris2t2a1, Surasa1, Khasa1,
<>Surabhi, Vinata1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Ira1, Kadru1,

<NI>The names of the wives given to An3giras, Aris2t2anemi,
<>Ba1huputra and Kr2s4a1s4va are not mentioned.
<NI>Besides these damsels, twentyfour daughters were born
<>to Daks2a of his wife Prasu1ti who was the sister of Utta1na-
<>pa1da. Dharmadeva married thirteen of them also, named
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,
<>Buddhi, Lajja1, Vapus, S4a1nti, Siddhi, Ki1rti. Of the rest,

<>to Pulaha, Santati to Kratu, Anasu1ya1 to Atri, U1rja1
<>to Vasis2t2ha, Sva1ha1 to Agnideva and Svadha1 to the
<>Manes. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>3) {%Sacrifice of Daks2a.%} Once Daks2a performed a sacri-
<>fice called Br2haspatisavana. To this sacrifice he did not
<>invite his daughter Sati1 or her husband S4iva. Daks2a
<>did not invite them because of three reasons according
<>to the Pura1n2as.
<NI>(1) Once Durva1sas, the son of Atri, went to Jambu1nada
<>and meditated with the mantra or spell of ‘Ma1ya1bi1ja’
<>and worshipped Jagadambika1 (mother of the
<>world) the goddess there. The goddess was much plea-
<>sed and gave him as a token of her pleasure the garland
<>of flowers she wore from which nectar was oozing.
<>Durva1sas wore it on his head and went to the palace of
<>Daks2a, the Praja1pati. When he saw such a wonderful
<>garland which was not of this world, he wanted to have
<>it and Durva1sas instantly gave it to Daks2a. He placed it in
<>a prominent place in his bedroom and enjoying the
<>wonderful fragrance of it he conjugated with his wife,
<>and polluted that pure garland by his lust. S4iva and his
<>wife came to know of this and they scolded Daks2a, who
<>kept this bitterness in his heart and when the sacrifice
<>was performed, he decided not to invite them. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>(2) S4iva was considered as a polluted man by Daks2a
<>as he had always been carrying with him the skull of
<>Brahma1 and so he thought it wrong on his part to admit
<>his daughter and son-in-law to the sacrificial hall. The
<>story of how S4iva came to have the skull, is given below.
<NI>In days of old when the whole world was under the
<>single ocean (of the great flood) the sun, the moon, the
<>fire, air everything was destroyed and darkness pre-
<>vailed. All the vegetations were destroyed. All the
<>emotions and non-emotions disappeared. The supreme
<>Lord was sleeping for so many thousands of nights
<>together. At the end of the night he assumed the attri-
<>bute of ‘Rajogun2a’ (activity) and got ready to create
<>the universe. From the face of the Supreme Lord and
<>creator of the universes came out Brahma1 with five faces.
<>In the same way, S4iva with three eyes and matted hair,
<>and trident and rosary of beads (Elaeo carpus) and with
<>attribute of ‘Tamas’ (darkness--destruction) also came
<>out. Both Brahma1 and S4iva were filled with egoism and
<>both began to quarrel with each other. It was a contest
<>as to who was greater. The contest ended in attack.
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1, when the
<>same face, flushed with anger, scolded S4iva. The head
<>fell into the hands of S4iva, who could not throw it down
<>as it didn't come off from his hand. Brahma1 cursed
<>S4iva and made him polluted. Since S4iva became polluted, [Page194-a+ 64]
<>his wife Sati1 also was considered as polluted by Daks2a.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) Once the praja1patis performed a sacrifice. Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva were present there. Daks2a, who had been
<>invited by the praja1patis also was present. When Daks2a
<>entered the hall his son-in-law S4iva did not rise up.
<>This arrogance of S4iva made Daks2a angry. Daks2a made
<>up his mind to take vengeance on S4iva, and performed
<>a sacrifice known as Br2haspatisavana. To that sacrifice
<>he did not invite S4iva or Sati1.
<NI>Hearing that her father was conducting a sacrifice Sati1
<>came uninvited. But Daks2a did not even look at her.
<>Sati1devi whose heart was broken at this treatment made
<>a fire and jumped into it and died. S4iva became furious
<>when he came to know of this. Being overwhelmed with
<>sorrow and anger he beat his matted hair on the ground,
<>from which two monsters, Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1,
<>came out. They ran to Daks2a's sacrificial hall and des-
<>troyed everything they saw, killed everybody, caught
<>hold of Daks2a and cut off his head. Then they began to
<>create havoc in the whole world. The hermits and
<>sages began to take to flight. Men and animals shivered.
<>Thus the three worlds began to tremble with fear. The
<>gods approached S4iva with supplication to curb his
<>anger. The gracious S4an3kara was pleased to recall the
<>monsters. After that everybody requested him to bring
<>Daks2a back to life. But the search made for the head of
<>Daks2a was futile. At last Brahma1 took the head of a
<>goat and joined it to the headless trunk of Daks2a. Thus
<>he was brought to life again.
<F>1. Though Daks2a was brought to life again with the head of a goat there is no mention of him again in the Pura1n2as. We hear of
<>Daks2a again as the son of Ma1ris2a1.</F> (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 7).
<NI>4) {%Cursing Candra.%} Candra had married twentyseven
<>daughters of Daks2a. But he showed particular attach-
<>ment to Rohin2i1. The other twentysix wives could not
<>bear this. They made a complaint to their father Daks2a.
<>Daks2a called Candra and advised him to show equal
<>attachment to all his wives and not to show any partia-
<>lity to anyone. Candra did not gainsay his father-in-
<>law, but he did not make any change in his disposition.
<>After a few days all the daughters except Rohin2i went
<>to the palace of Daks2a and told him that they were
<>going to stay with him. This time Daks2a got angry and
<>called Candra and cursed him to become a sick man
<>(of consumption).
<NI>From that day onwards Candra became a patient affec-
<>ted with consumption. All the vegetations in the world
<>began to weaken. It appeared that the world was
<>about to be destroyed. So the gods approached Daks2a
<>and requested him to show some leniency towards
<>Candra. Daks2a accordingly called Candra and told
<>him that he would be affected by consumption only for a
<>fortnight and after that he would recover gradually.
<>Candra went to Prabha1sa ti1rtha and Sarasvati1 ti1rtha and
<>dipped in water. He began to recover from that day.
<>It is according to the curse of Daksa that Candra (Moon)
<>waxes and wanes. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 35).
<NI>5) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) Daks2a has another name ‘Kan’.
<>“Daks2a the Praja1pati is a son of ten fathers. He has
<>two names. They are Daks2a and Kan.” (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 208, Stanza 7).
<NI>(2) When the emperor Pr2thu milked the earth, Daks2a [Page194-b+ 63]
<>was crowned as the King of the subjects. (See under
<>Pr2thu).
<NI>(3) It occurs in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>11, Stanza 18, that Daks2a was a member of the assemibly
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>(4) Daks2a was one of those who visited Bhi1s2ma in his
<>bed of arrows. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 47).
<NI>(5) Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 166 that the devas, the manes, the gandharvas,
<>the celestial maids, the Ra1ks2asas, animals and birds,
<>fishes and all living creatures were born from the daugh-
<>ters of Daks2a.
<HI>DAKSASA1VARN2I. The name of the ninth Manu.
<>During the regime of this Manu, there will be three
<>classes of devas (gods) called the Parn2as, the Mari1ci-
<>garbhas and the Sudharmans. Each of these gan2as or
<>classes will consist of twelve devas or gods. Indra, their
<>King will be known as Adbhuta. He will be mighty and
<>powerful. In that Manvantara (age of the Manu)
<>Savana, Dyutima1n, Bhavya, Vasu, Medha1tithi,
<>Jyotis2ma1n and Satya will be the Saptars2is (the seven
<>hermits) and Dhr2taketu, Di1ptiketu, Pan5cahasta, Nira1-
<>maya, Pr2thus4rava and others will be the sons of Manu,
<>Daks2asa1varn2i. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 2).
<HI>DA1KS2A1YAN2I. Daughter of Daks2a. This name is gene-
<>rally used for all the daughters of Daks2a. Occasionally
<>this name is used for the grand daughters of Daks2a
<>also.
<HI>DAKS2IN2A1. A daughter, born to Praja1pati Ruci, by his
<>wife A1ku1ti. The first Manu was Sva1yambhuva, the son
<>of Brahma1. He accepted S4ataru1pa1, his sister who be-
<>came sinless by penance, as his wife. S4ataru1pa1 gave birth
<>to two sons Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da, and two
<>daughters, Prasu1ti and A1ku1ti. Of these two daughters,
<>Prasu1ti1 was given to Praja1pati Daks2a and A1ku1ti to
<>Praja1pati Ruci. A1ku1ti gave birth to twins, a son named
<>Yajn5a and a daughter named Daks2in2a1. To Yajn5a
<>twelve sons were born by Daks2in2a1. They were a class
<>of devas (gods) called the Ya1mas in the regime of Manu
<>Sva1yambhuva (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7).
<>Now Daks2in2a1 is worshipped as a goddess. The same
<>Daks2in2a1 was reborn in the Goloka under the name
<>Sus4i1la1. At that time she was a cowherd woman and
<>friend of Ra1dha1. She liked to talk with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. One
<>day Ra1dha1 saw her sitting in the lap of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>engaged in sexual sports, in a secluded place. When
<>Sus4i1la1 saw that Ra1dha1 had found them out, she be-
<>came dumbfounded with shame, and sat with bowed
<>head. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a slowly placed Sus4i1la1 devi down and
<>instantly vanished. The angry Ra1dha1 cursed Sus4i1la1 to
<>become ashes if ever she entered the Goloka again. Then
<>Ra1dha1 ran about everywhere in search of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>but he could not be found.
<NI>Immediately after the curse, Sus4i1la1 got down from the
<>Goloka and began to worship Maha1laks2mi1 with devotion
<>and meditation and very severe fast and vow. After
<>a long time Maha1laks2mi1 appeared to her and blessed
<>her, and Sus4i1la1 became absorbed in Maha1laks2mi1.
<>Since the absorption of Sus4i1la1 devi1, who was the rebirth
<>of Daks2in2a1devi1, in Maha1laks2mi1, the sacrifice of the
<>devas (gods) became fruitless. They were much grieved.
<>They all went to Brahma1 to find a solution. As the matter
<>was serious Brahma1 meditated upon Vis2n2u, who [Page195-a+ 65]
<>became pleased with Brahma1 and to save the devas, he
<>attracted Daks2in2a1devi1 from the body of Maha1laks2mi1
<>and gave her as a present to Brahma1. Brahma1 gave that
<>devi1 (goddess) to Yajn5apurus2a (the god of sacrifice)
<>so that the sacrifices of gods might become fruitful.
<>When Yajn5apurus2a saw that supernatural beauty he was
<>overpowered by lust and swooned. The couple spent a
<>hundred divine years in seclusion enjoying the company
<>of each other, as a result of which devi1 became pregnant.
<>The pregnancy matured in twelve divine years and she
<>gave birth to a child which was named Phalada. It is
<>this same Phalada, the son of Yajn5apurus2a and Daks2in2a1
<>who awards fruits to all actions. The learned men say
<>that Yajn5apurus2a, Daks2in2a1devi1 and Phalada divide the
<>fruits of actions among the doers. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).
<HI>DAKS2IN2A1GNI. A strong wind born from the fire

<>under control. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30).
<HI>DAKS2IN2APA1N5CA1LA. A place famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>This place lies to the south of the Ganges up to the river
<>Cam3pat. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 14, Stanza 27, that the King of this country
<>fled to the south fearing Jara1sandha. Pa1n5ca1la lies to the
<>south and north of the Ganges. But the country was
<>divided into two when Dron2a defeated Drupada the
<>King of Pa1n5ca1la, and took away from him the part of the
<>country north of the Ganges. After that, the part taken
<>by Dron2a was called Uttarapa1n5ca1la and the part south
<>of the Ganges was called Daks2in2apa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 137).
<HI>DAKS2IN2ASINDHU. A holy place. This place is on the

<>Va1madeva was the priest of this King. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 192). See Pari1ks2it II.
<HI>DA1LBHYA (BAKADA1LBHYA). A Mahars2i of Naimi-
<>s4a1ran2ya. In Va1mana Pura1n2a, there is a story of how this
<>sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>kingdom in the sacrificial fire.
<NI>Long ago some of the sages of Naimis4a1ran2ya approached
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra with a request for some money. Their
<>leader was the sage Da1lbhya (Baka). It was he who
<>begged Dhr2tara1s2t2ra for money. The king not only
<>refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Pro-
<>voked at this, Da1lbhya began performing a homa in [Page195-b+ 65]
<>which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's kingdom was the havis in the form
<>of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avaki1rn2a-
<>maha1ti1rtha at Pr2thu1daka. As a result of it the kingdom
<>began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted
<>great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the
<>country's decline. They told him that the cause of the
<>disaster was Da1lbhya's homa. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra at once pro-
<>ceeded with rich presents to propitiate Da1lbhya at
<>Avaki1rn2amaha1ti1rtha. Da1lbhya was pleased and as
<>desired by the King, performed homa with milk and
<>honey and revived all those who had died. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 39).
<NI>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says
<>that this Mahar2s2i flourished in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly.
<>On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to
<>Dyumatsena, the father of Satyava1n. At that time, he
<>comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyava1n would be
<>blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter

<HI>DAMA1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 5).
<HI>DA1MACANDRA. A King. He was a mighty hero and a

<HI>DAMANA I. A brother of Damayanti1. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 8 it is mentioned that
<>King Bhi1ma had a daughter named Damayanti1, and
<>three sons named Dama, Da1nta and Damana.
<HI>DAMANA II. A hermit. Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha
<>pleased this hermit, who blessed the King and said that
<>he would get children. Accordingly the king got Dama-
<>yanti1 as his daughter and Dama, Da1nta and Damana
<>as his sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<HI>DAMANA III. The son of the King Paurava. Dhr2s2t2a-

<HI>DAMANA IV. A son of Bharadva1ja. After the investiture
<>with the Brahma string (upanayana) Damana started
<>on a travel. On the way near Amarakan2t2aka he met
<>with the hermit Garga who talked to him about the
<>glory of Ka1s4i. Damana who was a seeker of spiritual
<>knowledge, stopped his travel and sat down to do penance
<>and thus leaving his body he attained heaven. (Skanda
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 2, 4, 74).
<HI>DAMANAKA I. One of characters in a story, of Pan5ca-
<>tantra. (See Mitrabhedam).
<HI>DAMANAKA II. A daitya (asura) Maha1vis2n2u in his
<>incarnation as Matsya (Matsya1vata1ra), killed this asura
<>who was a dweller of the sea. Vis2n2u threw the body of
<>the asura into the earth. By the touch of the Lord the
<>body became fragrant and it was changed to a plant
<>which is known as (Kozhunnu or Kozhuntu) Dama-
<>nakam. (Skanda Pura1n2a). [Page196-a+ 64]
<HI>DAMANAKAM. The Ta1tiri tree (Grislea Tomentosa).
<>The ceremony of worshipping this tree is called Dama-
<>naka1rohan2avidhi. The Grislea tree is supposed to be
<>Bhairava, who had been changed to a tree by the curse
<>of S4iva. A story to this effect occurs in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Bhairava was formed from the anger of S4iva. Bhairava,
<>against the will of S4iva, destroyed the devas, and so
<>S4iva cursed him and turned him to a Ta1tiri tree. It is
<>called Damanaka because Bhairava tried to do ‘damana’
<>(restraint or punishment) to the gods.
<NI>Bhairava felt sorry at the curse of S4iva. He requested
<>S4iva to withdraw the curse. At last S4iva had pity on him
<>and said that all would worship Damanaka tree. The
<>method of that worship is called Damanaka1rohan2a-
<>vidhi. It is given below:
<NI>This tree should be worshipped on the seventh or thir-
<>teenth lunar day. The worshipper should go to the
<>tree, with those who recite mantras and spells. After
<>the worship is over the worshipper should say, “O,
<>Tree, which has originated by the power of Hari, you
<>come to my presence. On behalf of S4iva, and by his
<>order, I have to take you home.” Saying thus the
<>tree should be taken home and consecrated in the even-
<>ing in accordance with the rituals. In the house, the
<>Sun, S4iva and Agni should be evoked and worshipped
<>and then the root of the tree should be planted in the
<>I1s4a1na (N.E. point) corner of the house and when it
<>is planted, the spell or incantation of Va1madeva Mantra
<>or S4iromantra should be recited. In the same way
<>the trunk with the branches of the tree is planted on
<>the Northern part. The fallen leaves and flowers
<>should be placed on the eastern side. When the root
<>is planted the following prayer should be uttered:
<Poem>A1mantritosi deves4a
<>pra1tah2 ka1le maya1 prabho /
<>Kartavyastapaso la1bha1h2
<>Pu1rn2am3 sarvam3 tava1jn5aya1. //</Poem>
<>After that at dawn he should take bath and with obla-
<>tions of sweet-smelling flowers etc. should worship
<>S4iva. This is Damanaka1rohan2avidhi. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 80).
<HI>DAMAYANTI1 Daughter of Bhi1ma the King of Vidar-
<>bha. The most noble of all the Indian heroines, Dama-
<>yanti1 has secured a place in the literatures of almost
<>all the languages in the world. The famous hero Nala
<>is her huband.
<NI>1) {%The background of the story of Nala.%} During the time
<>of the forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas, Arjuna had gone to
<>Kaila1sa to do penance before S4iva for getting divine
<>weapons. The rest of the Pa1n2d2avas spent the time
<>till the arrival of Arjuna, in sorrow and sadness. They
<>spent miserable days one by one. At that time the her-
<>mit Br2hadas4va visited them. They welcomed the
<>hermit. In the midst of their conversation Dharma-
<>putra told the hermit with tears that he was the most
<>unhappy man in the world. Hearing this the hermit
<>told them the story of Nala, to console the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Damayanti1.%} The King Bhi1ma of Vidar-
<>bha was childless for a long time. While the King was
<>spending sorrowful days, as he had no children, a
<>hermit named Dama reached his palace. The King
<>welcomed the hermit. Seeing the sorrow of the King the
<>hermit blessed the King and the queen, and as a result
<>a daughter named Damayanti1 and as her brothers [Page196-b+ 64]
<>three sons Dama, Da1nta and Damana were born to
<>them.
<NI>3) {%The Svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1.%} During
<>this period a son named Nala was born to Vi1rasena the
<>King of Nis2adha. The child was an expert in the game
<>of dice and he would speak only truth. He grew up
<>and became a youth.
<NI>Once the swans which came to the palace of Dama-
<>yanti1 from Nala, began to praise Nala. They sang
<>about the glory of Nala. Nala also knew about the
<>beauty and the other good qualities of Damayanti1.
<>Thus they fell in love with each other. Nala also started
<>for Kun2d2inapuri1, the capital city of Vidarbha, to marry
<>Damayanti1. The devas (gods) Indra, Agni, Varun2a
<>and Yama, having heard of the beauty of Damayanti1
<>from Na1rada, had gone Kun2d2inapuri1, to take part
<>in the marriage. On the way they met Nala. They
<>were aware of the fact that Damayanti1 was in love
<>with Nala. So they called Nala and sent him to Dama-
<>yanti1 with a message that Damayanti1 should accept
<>one of the four gods as her husband. By the boon of
<>invisibility, given by the Gods, Nala entered the room
<>of Damayanti1 unseen by others and gave the message
<>to Damayanti1. But Damayanti1 did not agree to it.
<>The Gods also entered the nuptial hall and took their
<>seats in the shape of four Nalas. Damayanti1 entered
<>the hall with the nuptial garland in her hands. She
<>saw five Nalas including the real Nala, and prayed to
<>the gods to show her the real Nala her lover. So the
<>devas assumed their real forms and Damayanti1 put
<>the garland on the neck of the real Nala and accepted
<>him as her husband. Being much pleased with the be-
<>haviour and character of both Nala and Damayanti1,
<>the four gods blessed them. Agni promised to be near
<>Nala whenever he thought of him. Yama said that
<>Nala would always be righteous. Varun2a said that
<>Nala would obtain water at the thought of it. Indra
<>blessed him saying that he would get moks2a immedia-
<>tely after the completion of a ya1ga. The gods remained
<>till the end of the marriage ceremony and then they
<>departed. Nala and Damayanti1 lived in Kun2d2inapuri1.
<NI>4) {%The hatred between Kali and Dva1para.%} Hearing about
<>the Svayamvara of Damayanti1 Kali and Dva1para
<>started for Kun2d2inapuri1. On the way they met Indra
<>and the other gods, who were returning from the marri-
<>age of Damayanti1. They told Kali and Dva1para that
<>Damayanti1 had accepted Nala as her husband. Kali
<>and Dva1para got angry at this and returned saying
<>that they would destroy the kingdom of Nala. After
<>that Kali waited for a chance to enter the body of
<>Nala. After twelve years, once Nala, after passing
<>urine, without washing his legs performed his evening
<>worship. At that moment Kali entered the body of
<>Nala. With that Nala became bereft of all senses of
<>righteousness and duty, and challenged his younger
<>brother Pus2kara to a game of dice. Pus2kara engaged
<>Nala in the game of dice. Kali stood in the shape of
<>an ox as helper of Nala. Nala lost his kingdom in the
<>game. Seeing that her husband was being defeated
<>continuously, Damayanti1 sent for the charioteer Va1rs2-
<>n2eya and sent her son Indrasena and daughter Indra-
<>sena1 to Kun2d2inapuri1. After leaving the children at Kun2d2i-
<>napuri1 Va1rs2n2eya engaged himself in a travel. After
<>visiting several countries he reached Ayodhya1 and [Page197-a+ 65]
<>became the charioteer of King R2tuparn2a.
<NI>5) {%Nala and Damayanti1 to the forest.%} Pus2kara got the
<>kingdom, wealth and everything that his elder brother,
<>Nala, had possessed. The miserable Nala left every-
<>thing he had and clad in only one cloth got out of the
<>palace. His wife Damayanti1 followed him. They stayed
<>outside the city for three days. Pus2kara made a pro-
<>clamation that if anybody rendered any help to Nala
<>he would be ruthlessly put to death. After that Nala stay-
<>ed there for three more days, with only water for food
<>and drink. Then he went to the forest. His wife followed
<>him. They were hungry. Nala saw some golden birds.
<>Nala wanted to catch them for food. So he took his
<>only cloth and spread it on the ground. The birds
<>took that cloth and flew away. Those birds were the
<>dices used in the game. They were influenced by
<>Kali. The miserable and hungerstricken Nala asked
<>his wife Damayanti1 to go with the caravan traders
<>who were going to Avanti and save herself. But she
<>did not consent to go away from him.
<NI>They spent that night in an inn. They both fell asleep
<>because of weakness. After a time Nala woke up.
<>He thought that his wife would somehow or other
<>get to some country closeby and save herself, if he
<>left her there. So he decided to take half of her cloth.
<>How to do it without her knowledge? Thinking so he
<>walked round the inn. He saw a good sword. He
<>took the sword, and cut half of the cloth of Damayanti1
<>and leaving her in the inn he went away.
<NI>In a short while she woke up and missing her husband
<>she cried aloud and ran here and there in search of
<>him. Then she went into the forest crying. A big snake
<>caught hold of her and began to swallow her. She cried
<>aloud. Hearing the cry, a forester came there. He
<>cut the snake open and saved Damayanti1. But when
<>he saw her he became overpowered by libido and
<>tried to make her his wife. She got angry and cursed
<>him and he instantly fell down dead. After this she
<>began to wander in the forest aimlessly, often seeing
<>wild animals and fearing them. At last she got on a
<>rock and sat there and began to wail thinking of Nala.
<NI>6) {%Damayanti1 in the kingdom of Cedi.%} While she was
<>sitting on the rock wailing, a caravan of traders came
<>by that way. They had been attacked by a herd of
<>elephants and were running away from them. They
<>saw Damayanti1. She told them her story. They brought
<>her to the kingdom of Cedi. She wandered through
<>the country for a while and finally reached the palace
<>of the King Suba1hu. Thinking her to be a mad wo-
<>man the street boys were following her. The queen
<>saw the woman surrounded by street boys and felt
<>pity for her. She sent her maid and brought her to
<>the palace. Without revealing that she was the queen
<>of King Nala, she told everything else to the queen.
<>The queen consoled her and said that she would get her
<>husband back. She invited Damayanti1 to stay in the
<>palace till she got her husband back. Damayanti1
<>replied as follows: “Mother, I shall stay here. But
<>there are certain conditions. I won't eat remains and
<>offals of victuals, I won't make others to wash my legs.
<>I won't talk with men who are not related to me. If
<>anybody hankers after me you must order him to be
<>killed. Bra1hman2as may come and see me only in con-
<>nection with the search for my husband. This is my
<>vow.” The queen agreed to her conditions and made [Page197-b+ 65]
<>her the attendant of her daughter Sunanda1.
<NI>7) {%Nala in Ayodhya1.%} Nala filled with sorrow was walk-
<>ing along the forest when he saw a wild fire. From the
<>midst of the fire somebody was calling Nala by name
<>and crying. When Nala approached the fire, he saw
<>the great and famous serpent Karkot2aka lying entwined
<>in the flames. Karkot2aka the King of the Na1gas had
<>once deceived Na1rada, who then cursed him that he
<>would become stationary in a place like an immovable
<>thing till Nala came and rescued him. From that day
<>onwards, Karkot2aka was remaining in that forest with-
<>out moving. Then the forest caught fire. Karkot2aka
<>being unable to move had to remain in the fire. Nala
<>immediately saved Karkot2aka from the fire and with
<>that he was absolved from the curse of Na1rada. Kar-
<>kot2aka asked Nala to walk forward, counting the steps.
<>When Nala counted ten, Karkot2aka bit on the leg of
<>Nala and he became ugly. Then the serpent said to
<>the flurried Nala, “Don't fear. I have made you ugly
<>so that others may not recognize you. Now you are
<>ugly because of my poison. But my poison has affected
<>Kali who is in your body. Because he had harmed
<>you who are blameless, he has to suffer for it. So long
<>as this poison is in you, nobody will harm you. You
<>must go to R2tuparn2a the King of Ayodhya1 and tell
<>him that you are Ba1huka a charioteer. You must give
<>R2tuparn2a the spell ‘As4vahr2daya mantra’ and get
<>from him the spell ‘Aks2ahr2dayamantra’. After that
<>you will have reunion with your wife and children.
<>Here are two cloths for you. Whenever you want
<>to get your original form you need only wear them.”
<>Saying these words Karkot2aka gave Nala two divine
<>garments and then disappeared.
<NI>Nala started for Ayodhya1. He reached the palace
<>on the tenth day. There he was employed as the horse
<>keeper of R2tuparn2a on a pay of hundred pieces of gold.
<>Thus he stayed there under the name Ba1huka. Va1rs2n2eya
<>and Ji1vala who were the horse-keepers of R2tuparn2a
<>upto that time, were placed under Ba1huka.
<NI>Ba1huka used to recite a poem every evening when he
<>returned from his work.
<Poem>Weary and worn of hunger and thirst,
<>That poor woman, where might she be?
<>Serving whom will she be now.
<>Thinking of the unlucky fool?</Poem>
<NI>Hearing this song of lamentation everyday, once his
<>assistant Ji1vala asked Ba1huka, whom he was reciting
<>the poem about. Ba1huka replied: “Once there was
<>a man who was a fool. He got a good wife. For some
<>reason they were separated. The fool is still wandering
<>about weary and sad in search of his wife.”
<NI>8) {%Damayanti1 in Kun2d2inapura.%} At this time Dama-
<>yanti1 was living in the palace of the King of Cedi,
<>as the maid of princess Sunanda1. King Bhi1ma became
<>very sorry not knowing where Nala and Damayanti1
<>had gone. He sent men in all directions to search for
<>them. The King proclaimed that those who found
<>them would be awarded thousand cows, lands assigned
<>to Brahmins, and villages. He proclaimed that so
<>many cows would be given even to those who could
<>give any information about them. Hearing this Bra1h-
<>man2as went in all directions and Sudeva, one of them,
<>reached the Kingdom of Cedi. He recognized Dama-
<>yanti1 who was like fire inside the cover of smoke. When
<>Damayanti1 was alone Sudeva approached her and [Page198-a+ 65]
<>said that he had come from Vidarbha and that he was
<>a friend of Damayanti1's brother. Damayanti1 recog-
<>nized Sudeva and she cried aloud. Sunanda1 who saw
<>this scene, told her mother about it. The queen sent
<>for Sudeva and asked him what the matter was. He
<>revealed everything about Damayanti1, to the queen.
<>When they heard the story all the women in the harem
<>cried. Then with tears the queen said, “Hear this,
<>Damayanti1, your mother and myself are the two daugh-
<>ters of Sudama the King of Das4a1rn2a. Father gave
<>your mother to Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha and me
<>to Vi1raba1hu the King of Cedi. I have seen you when
<>you were an infant.”
<NI>When the King of Cedi knew everything he sent Dama-
<>yanti1 in a palanquin to Vidarbha.
<NI>9) {%The search for Nala.%} Damayanti1 told her father
<>that she didn't want to live any longer unless Nala
<>was brought to her. Bhi1ma had been trying hard to
<>find out Nala. One day Parn2a1da one of the numerous
<>Brahmins who were engaged in the search for Nala,
<>came to Bhi1ma and said, “while I was wandering from
<>place to place, I happened to reach the palace of R2tu-
<>parn2a the King of Ayodhya1. There I made enquiries
<>about Nala the husband of Damayanti1, in the pre-
<>sence of the King. But nobody gave me any answer.
<>When I returned Ba1huka the charioteer of R2tuparn2a
<>followed me. An ugly man with short hands, an ex-
<>pert in driving horses, and an excellent cook, he asked
<>me several questions about Damayanti1.”
<NI>When Damayanti1 heard this she had horripilation.
<>She secretly went to her mother and compelled her
<>to send Sudeva the Bra1hman2a to Ayodhya1. Her mother
<>consented. She called Sudeva, in the presence of her
<>mother and told him to go to Ayodhya1 and tell R2tuparn2a
<>that the second svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1
<>would take place before sunrise next day and that
<>he should come earlier. Sudeva instantly went to
<>Ayodhya1.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, hearing the words of Sudeva, wanted
<>Ba1huka to take him in the chariot to Vidarbha within
<>the period of a day time for the second svayam3vara
<>of Damayanti1. Nala consented with a breaking heart.
<>Immediately they started. Va1rs2n2eya also got into
<>the chariot. The chariot flew through the sky with
<>tremendous speed, to Vidarbha. On the way the upper
<>garment of the King fell on the ground. He ordered
<>the chariot to be stopped for taking his upper garment.
<>Nala said that within that winking time the chariot
<>had travelled a yojana (league) and gloried in his
<>power of driving horses. Then they saw in the forest
<>a Tanni tree (Terminalia bellerica) with fruits. Seeing
<>the Tanni tree the King said, “O Ba1huka, if you are
<>an expert in horse-driving I am an expert in reckoning.
<>I will tell you how many leaves and nuts there are
<>in that Tanni Tree. There are five crores of leaves in
<>both the branches together and two thousand and
<>ninetyfive nuts. They stopped the chariot and checked
<>the tree and found the reckoning of the King correct.
<>The King had the knowledge of the art called ‘Aks2ahr2-
<>daya’. It was with this art that the king calculated
<>the number of leaves in the tree, at one look. Ba1huka
<>drove the chariot with the speed of wind because he had
<>known the art called ‘As4vahr2daya’. Then and there,
<>Ba1huka taught the King the art of ‘As4vahr2daya’ and
<>the King taught Ba1huka the art of ‘Aks2ahr2daya’. The [Page198-b+ 65]
<>moment Nala learned Aks2ahr2daya Kali vomitted
<>the poison of Karkot2aka and got out of the body of
<>Nala. Long ago, the mother of Indrasena, a god, had
<>cursed Kali and drove him out. Since then Kali had
<>been living in the body of Nala. As soon as he came
<>out Kali begged Nala for pardon. Nala curbed his
<>anger. But Kali was afraid of Nala. So he made the
<>Tanni tree his abode. Because of that Tanni became
<>detestable.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, Va1rs2n2eya and Ba1huka reached Kun2d2ina-
<>pura in the evening. When the sound of the chariot
<>of Nala reached the ears of Damayanti1 her heart bumped
<>with joy. The chariot was stopped and R2tuparn2a
<>entered the palace. The King Bhi1ma welcomed
<>R2tuparn2a heartily. As there was no sign of any prepara-
<>tion for the svayam3vara (marriage) R2tuparn2a under-
<>stood that some sort of trick had been played on him.
<NI>10) {%Test of Nala.%} Damayanti1 sent her maid Kes4ini1
<>to Ba1huka to watch him. Kes4ini1 had a secret talk
<>with Ba1huka. Though Nala did not reveal himself,
<>he cried when she talked about Damayanti1. Kes4ini1
<>returned to Damayanti1 and told her what she had
<>heard and seen. Damayanti1 became more and more
<>convinced that Ba1huka was Nala himself So she sent
<>Kes4ini1 again to Nala. She discovered the following
<>facts about Ba1huka, after a keen observation, and
<>made a report of them.
<NI>(1) Ba1huka does not stop to pass through even a small
<>door. The upper sill lifts by itself for him to pass
<>through.
<NI>(2) He gets enough room for him to pass through even
<>a big crowd.
<NI>(3) Empty pots are filled with water at a look from him.
<NI>(4) When he stretches out a grass to the sun, it catches
<>fire.
<NI>(5) Fire does not burn him even if he touches it.
<NI>(6) When he crushes a flower, it blooms more beauti-
<>ful and fragrant than before.
<NI>When Kes4ini1 said all these facts to Damayanti1, she
<>became fully convinced that Ba1huka was none other
<>than Nala himself. Damayanti1 sent Kes4ini1 again to
<>Ba1huka to get some meat cooked by him. Damayanti1
<>tested the taste of the meat brought by Kes4ini1 and
<>she knew that the food was cooked by Nala. She
<>sent Kes4ini1 again to Ba1huka with her children. See-
<>ing Indrasena and Indrasena1 coming to him, Ba1huka
<>ran to them, gathered them and embraced them and
<>cried aloud. Then he told Kes4ini1 that he had done
<>so because the children were just like his two child-
<>ren.
<NI>11) {%Reunion.%} After having tested Ba1huka so far Dama-
<>yanti1 sent Kes4ini1 to her mother to tell her everything,
<>and to say that she was convinced of the fact that
<>Ba1huka was none other than Nala and that the diffe-
<>rence was only in shape and to request that she may
<>be permitted to see Ba1huka in person. The queen
<>informed the King of all these facts. With the permis-
<>sion of her parents Ba1huka was brought to the room
<>of Damayanti1. The moment Ba1huka saw Damayanti1
<>he began to shed tears. Damayanti1 also was filled
<>with emotion. But she told him thus:--
<NI>“Ba1huka, have you seen a man who had left his sleep-
<>ing wife in the forest? Who else, but Nala the famous
<>and the righteous would discard his blameless and
<>loving wife who had been sleeping, with fatigue and [Page199-a+ 65]
<>hunger in a lonely place? Have I done anything
<>wrong to him in my younger days so that he should
<>leave me in the forest when I was sleeping? Leaving
<>aside real gods I married him. I worshipped, him. I had
<>children from his blood and now he has abandoned
<>me. In the presence of Gods and with fire as witness,
<>holding my hands he had taken a vow that he would
<>support and protect me. Where has that vow gone?”
<>At these words Ba1huka shed tears for a long time.
<>Then he told her all that had happened to him since
<>their separation. Damayanti1 requested Nala, not to
<>have any misconception regarding the idea of a second
<>svayam3vara; she said to him that she committed no
<>wrong and that her fidelity and loyalty had undergone
<>no change. At that time Va1yu (the wind-god) in an
<>etherial voice said “Damayanti1 has committed no
<>sin”. Immediately Nala put on the divine clothes
<>given by Karkot2aka and regained his original form.
<>Damayanti1 embraced Nala and cried aloud. The king
<>her father, mother and the people of the city all ran
<>to them.
<NI>Next day R2tuparn2a returned. After a few days Nala
<>collected an army consisting of three hundred soldiers,
<>sixteen elephants, fifty horses and a white chariot only,
<>from Vidarbha and went to the kingdom of Nis2adha.
<>Reaching there Nala challenged Pus2kara for a game of
<>dice. Pus2kara refused the challenge. Nala took his
<>sword to cut Pus2kara into two. Finally Pus2kara agreed
<>to play. At the first cast of the dice the life and the
<>Kingdom of Pus2kara fell into the hands of Nala. But
<>Nala did not kill Pus2kara; instead, he embraced him.
<>Nala became King. Damayanti1 and the children reached
<>Nis2adha. Nala ruled the country with more happiness
<>and prosperity than before. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapters 52 to 79).
<HI>DAMAYANTI1 II. The daughter of Pramloca. See

<>This Dam3bha is the father of S4an3khacu1d2a, an asura.
<>Dam3bha received from their teacher S4ukra, the spell

<HI>DAM3BHODBHAVA. An ancient emperor. He was a
<>mighty warrior prince. He brought the whole world
<>under control. At last there was nobody left to fight
<>with. So he walked about challenging everybody he met
<>with. But none dared to fight with him. Then Brahma1
<>advised him to challenge Nara Na1ra1yan2as who were
<>doing penance on the northern-most point of the earth.
<>So the emperor went with his mighty army to Gandha-
<>ma1dana and informed Nara and Na1ra1yan2a of his desire
<>to fight. They said that they were mere hermits and
<>that they had no power to fight. But Dam3bhodbhava was
<>not satisfied. Finally Nara and Na1ra1yan2a took some
<>is2i1ka1 grass and began to fight the emperor with it.
<>Though the army of the emperor was mighty and vast
<>it could not stand against the grass in the hands of the [Page199-b+ 65]

<>of righteousness. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 96).

<HI>DAN2D2A II.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Another Ks2atriya King of
<>ancient India. He was the son of the King Vidan2d2a.
<>In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 185, it is mentioned
<>that Vidan2d2a and Dan2d2a had attended Draupadi1
<>Svayam3vara (the marriage of Draupadi1).
<NI>2) {%Other information.%} (1) Bhi1masena defeated the

<>aka used to steal the wealth of the Bra1hman2as, kill
<>those who trusted him, speak lies, rape the women of
<>others, drink liquor, eat the flesh of cows, mingle with
<>wicked people and do various other sinful deeds daily.
<>Dan2d2a once went to a Vais2n2avite temple to commit
<>robbery. When he reached the steps of the temple he
<>wiped his legs which were wet, on the ground and a
<>small depression that was there, was levelled by the [Page200-b+ 65]
<>drawing of his legs. He broke the lock with an iron rod
<>and entered the temple. Inside the temple he saw Kr2s2n2a,
<>clad in yellow robes lying on a beautiful cot, with his
<>spouse Ra1dha1. The thief instantly bowed before the
<>spouse of Ra1dha1. By this act his sins were washed away.
<>Still impelled by his evil nature, he took the silk garment
<>of Kr2s2n2a, spread it on the ground, collected as many
<>things as he could take, placed them in the garment and
<>making them into a bundle, got out of the temple
<>with shaky feet. The bundle fell on the ground with a
<>loud noise. Hearing the noise the neighbours woke up
<>and looked out. The thief began to run and was bitten
<>by a poisonous snake and fell down dead. The men of
<>Yama (God of death) tied the spirit of the thief with a
<>rope and took him before Yama. Citragupta looked
<>into his accounts and informed Yama that he had
<>committed all the sins. Yama asked if there was any
<>good deed to his account. Then Citragupta said “When
<>this great sinner was going to commit theft in a Vais2n2a-
<>vite temple, at the steps of the temple, he levelled a pit
<>by the mud on his leg, and that single good deed on
<>his part has wiped out all his sins.” Hearing this Yama
<>gave him a golden seat and showed hospitality and then
<>bowed before him and said “By the soil on your legs you
<>have purified my abode today. I am grateful to you.
<>Now you may go to the blissful world of Vis2n2u where
<>there are no deaths or births or sorrow”. Hearing this
<>Dan2d2a entered Vaikun2t2ha. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 1).
<HI>DAN2D2A VII. A giant (Ra1ks2asa). This giant Dan2d2a
<>was born to the giant Suma1li, by his wife Ketumati1.

<HI>DAN2D2ANI1TI. (The laws of chastisement). Dan2d2a-
<>ni1ti is the law of punishment given to the subjects
<>by Kings of ancient India. According to the criminal
<>laws of ancient India, fining a man upto two hundred
<>and fifty pan2as (a coin) was called Prathama S4a1hasa
<>dan2d2a (first degree of punishment) and fining up to
<>five hundred pan2as was called Madhyama Sa1hasa [Page201-b+ 65]
<>dan2d2a (medium punishment) and fining upto thou-
<>sand pan2as was called Uttama Sa1hasa dan2d2a (highest
<>degree of punishment). If a man complains to
<>the King that his property is stolen, when actually
<>it is not stolen, the man will be fined the amount
<>that is said to have been stolen. There was another
<>law, that the owner of the stolen property and
<>the thief would have to pay double the amount
<>they admit, if the amount shown in the complaint
<>differed from the actual amount stolen. For appear-
<>ing as false witness, the three classes of non-Brahmins
<>were punished with fine and if he was a Brahmin he
<>would have to be cast out of the society. The King
<>ordered that if one spent the property entrusted with
<>him for keeping, the owner of the property would
<>have to be paid double the amount. If one says that
<>he has given the property for keeping when actually
<>it is not, the person will have to be punished as if he
<>were a thief. If a man spends an amount without
<>knowing that it was the property of others, the man
<>will have to be acquitted of the charge.
<NI>If an artisan has received money in advance for a parti-
<>cular product and fails to give the thing at the stipu-
<>lated time the King will fine the artisan one svarn2a.
<>If a man received money in advance on a promise to
<>do a particular work and if he fails to do the work he
<>will be fined one Kr2s2n2ala of gold. (One Kr2s2n2ala
<>weighs three yavagrains). If a man conceals his diseases
<>and marries a damsel, she will be considered as a spins-
<>ter and the man will be fined two hundred pan2as.
<>If a cowherd agrees to look after the cows of another
<>receiving pay and food and refuses to return the cow
<>to the owner the King will fine him hundred pan2as.
<>If a Ks2atriya scoffed a Bra1hman2a the fine imposed
<>would be hundred pan2as. If it is a Vais4ya the fine will
<>be two hundred pan2as. If it is a S4u1dra he will be put
<>to death. If a Brahmin scoffs a Ks2atriya the fine is
<>fifty pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Vais4ya the fine is twenty-
<>five pan2as. If a Brahmin scoffs a S4u1dra the fine is
<>only twelve pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Ks2atriya his
<>tongue should be cut off. If a S4u1dra advises a Brahmin,
<>he may inflict any punishment on the S4u1dra.
<NI>If a S4u1dra wronged a Brahmin, the S4u1dra might be
<>punished by cutting off the organ which was employed
<>in the crime. If one spat at a Brahmin, the two lips of
<>the culprit might be cut off. If a man passed urine on a
<>Brahmin the culprit would have his penis cut off. If
<>a S4u1dra sits on the seats of the upper classes his but-
<>tock will have to be cut off. If one slays cow, elephant,
<>camel or horse half of his limbs will have to be cut
<>off. Cutting across a road, changing of boundaries,
<>making the water of pools and ponds impure etc. will
<>have to be punished with a fine of two suvarn2as. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 227).
<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I I. A king of the family of Yaya1ti.

<>of Nimi. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I II. The son of Paun2d2raka, the King
<>of Ka1s4i. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Paun2d2raka. As his son
<>Dan2d2apa1n2i was not powerful enough to kill S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>he performed the sacrifice of Mahes4vara yajn5a. Being
<>pleased at the sacrifice S4iva created Kr2tya1 in the
<>sacrificial fire and sent her to Dva1raka1 to destroy S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a, who aimed his Sudars4ana cakra (wheel-weapon)
<>at her. She ran to Va1ra1n2asi1, where the wheel turned [Page202-a+ 65]

<>literature. He lived in the 6th century B.C. His criti-
<>cal work Ka1vya1dars4a made him famous. There are

<>marrow of the bo{??}es, and liver and sperm in the fire.
<>When the sperm was put in the fire there was a voice
<>‘Don't’ and with that the king fell dead. And instantly
<>seven luminous children came out from the fire. They
<>began to cry aloud. Hearing their cry Brahma1 came
<>there and anointed them as the Maruts (wind gods).

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Das4aratha was the son of Aja, of the family
<>of Iks2va1ku, born of his wife Indumati1.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, Stanza 6 that ‘Ilabila1, was the name of the mother of Das4aratha.</F>
<NI>3) {%Das4aratha's hunt.%} Once during the early part of his
<>life Das4aratha was walking through a forest engaged in
<>hunting. He reached the bank of the river Sarayu1.
<>It was evening and the forest was thick. He walked in
<>search of wild animals. The night was advancing and
<>darkness getting thicker. Then he heard a sound from
<>the river as if an elephant was drinking water. Thinking
<>it to be an elephant Das4aratha sent an arrow in the
<>direction from which the sound came. Instantly he heard
<>a man crying with pain. The king was disappointed.
<>He ran to the spot and saw a hermit boy lying in a pool
<>of blood beating his limbs on the ground and crying.
<>The waterpot he had been dipping in the water lay
<>close by. In answer to the questions of the King, the [Page204-a+ 65]
<>hermit boy whose name was S4ravan2a,
<F>1. In Agnipura1n2a Chapter 6, it is stated that the name of this hermit boy was Yajn5adatta.</F> said, “Oh
<>King! What wrong have I done? My parents are
<>sitting thirsty and blind with age, in the hermitage close-
<>by. I, their only son, was dipping the pot to take water
<>to them, when you sent the arrow at me. So, please take
<>some water to them in this pot and console them.”
<NI>Hearing this, with tears the King drew out the fatal
<>arrow from the body of the boy and with that the boy
<>S4ravan2a said good bye to the world. Das4aratha took
<>water in the pot and went in search of the hermitage in
<>the darkness. With difficulty he found out the hermitage
<>and as he drew near, the aged parents of the boy heard
<>his footsteps and called him eagerly. The King, with
<>tearful eyes told them what had happened. There was
<>loud wailing and crying in the hermitage. According to
<>their wish the King took them to where their son lay.
<>Then the King made a fire and placed the dead body
<>of the boy in it. The aged and blind parents cursed
<>Das4aratha, “You also will die of loss of children”.
<>Then they also entered the fire and were burnt along
<>with their son's dead body. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayo-
<>dhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 63).
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} Das4aratha had three wives, named
<>Kaus4alya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1.
<NI>5) {%Kaikeyi1 given a boon.%} There was a great battle in the
<>world of the gods between the asuras and the gods.
<>According to the request of the devas, Das4aratha went to
<>the world of the devas to help them. Kaikeyi1 also went
<>with Das4aratha. In a severe fight with S4ambara, an
<>asura, Das4aratha fell down unconscious. Kaikeyi1 took
<>him away from the battle-field. When he recovered the
<>King got into the chariot and fought more fiercely than
<>before. This time the wheel-bolt of one of the wheels of
<>the chariot of Das4aratha slipped away. Without inform-
<>ing her husband of this danger, Kaikeyi1 inserted her
<>finger into the bolt-hole and prevented the wheel from
<>sliding away. The King won the battle. After the battle,
<>when the King came to know of the services rendered
<>by Kaikeyi1, he promised her two boons. Kaikeyi1 told
<>the King that she would ask for them later, when she
<>needed them. Then they returned to Ayodhya1. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Sarga 9, Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Administration of Das4aratha.%} The capital of Das4a-
<>ratha's kingdom of Kosala, was Ayodhya1. This city was
<>situated on the bank of river Sarayu1. Das4aratha was as
<>famous in Ayodhya1 as Indra was in the realm of the
<>gods. There were palaces in Ayodhya1 for the kings who
<>brought tribute to stay. In short, as mentioned in
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 5, Ayodhya1 was
<>the heaven on earth.
<NI>7) {%Ministers.%} Das4aratha had eight ministers, Sr2s2t2i,
<>Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddha1rtha, Ra1s2t2ravardhana, As4oka,
<>Dharmapa1la, and Sumantra. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<NI>8) {%The name Das4aratha.%} The real name of Das4aratha
<>was Nemi. Once the unattackable and invincible asura
<>S4am3bara conquered the throne of Indra. At the request
<>of Brahma1 and the gods, this King reached heaven and
<>destroyed the armies of the asuras very easily. S4am3bara
<>got angry, assumed ten shapes and attacked the King
<>from ten points at the same time. The king confronted
<>the ten S4am3baras at ten points, at the same time, and
<>killed all of them at the same moment. Because he
<>faced his chariot to ten points at the same time and
<>fought with enemies on those ten points Brahma1 appre- [Page204-b+ 64]
<>ciated his valiant fighting and charioteeering and gave
<>him the name ‘Das4aratha’ (one who is capable of driving
<>the chariot to ten points at the same time). Thus his
<>original name was forgotten and he came to be known
<>only by the name given him later. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>9) {%Birth of Sons.%} Kausalya1 was the first wife of Das4a-
<>ratha. She was the daughter of the King of Uttara
<>Kosala. A daughter named S4a1nta1 was born to Das4aratha
<>by Kausalya1. After this, no sons or daughters were born
<>to Das4aratha for a long time.
<NI>At this juncture Lomapa1da, the king of An3ga who was the
<>class-mate and a great friend of Das4aratha, came to
<>Ayodhya1 on a friendly visit. He also had no children.
<>So he entreated Das4aratha to give S4a1nta1 to him as a
<>foster-daughter. Thus he took away S4a1nta1 to An3ga.
<>Lomapa1da gave S4a1nta1 in marriage to R2s2yas2r2n3ga a
<>hermit. (See under R2s2yas4r2n3ga).
<NI>As Kausalya1 was childless Das4aratha brought as his
<>wife Kaikeyi1 the daughter of the King of Kekaya and
<>sister of Yudha1jit. Still no children were born to them.
<>He was much disappointed. At last he married again and
<>brought Sumitra1 the princess of Ka1s4i. Of these three,
<>Kausalya1 was the chief wife.
<NI>Though he had three wives, Das4aratha still remained
<>childless. The King and his queens spent their days in
<>sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse
<>he had incurred when he was young. The curse was
<>that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their
<>son S4ravan2a, the same thing would happen to me.
<>So he believed that sons would be born to him.
<NI>He performed several devotional acts to get children.
<>Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to
<>lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use
<>and consecrated the idol of Maha1vis2n2u in it. Then entrust-
<>ing the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers
<>he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion
<>and meditation in the temple. Then the King decided
<>to perform the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i (sacrifice for
<>getting children) by the hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga under the
<>guidance of Vasis2t2ha. The King informed R2s2yas4r2n3ga
<>of his decision. R2s2yas4r2n3ga could not refuse the King's
<>request as the king was his father-in-law. Moreover
<>Lomapa1da and S4a1nta1 also requested the hermit to com-
<>ply with the desire of Das4aratha. So R2s2yas4r2n3ga came to
<>Ayodhya1 and the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i was begun.
<>The air vibrated with the recitation of mantras (spells and
<>incantations) and the Veda Su1ktas. The hermit uttered
<>the divine spell of Putraka1mes2t2i and offered oblations
<>in the sacrificial fire. Then a wonderful and luminous
<>figure came out of the fire with a pot containing a
<>pudding of ambrosia, and placed the pot before R2s2ya-
<>s2r2n3ga and then disappeared in the sacrificial fire. When
<>the wonderful figure disappeared, R2s2yas4r2n3ga took the
<>pot of pudding and gave it to Das4aratha with prayer and
<>incantations. Das4aratha received the golden pot and in
<>accordance with the instruction of the hermit, divided
<>the pudding between his first wife Kaus4alya1 and second
<>wife Kaikeyi1, both of whom gave half of their share to
<>Sumitra1. Thus the three wives ate the divine pudding
<>and by and by all of them became pregnant. Kaus4alya1
<>and Kaikeyi1 gave birth to a son each and Sumitra1
<>gave birth to two sons. The son of Kaus4alya1 was called
<>Ra1ma, the son of Kaikeyi1 was named Bharata and the [Page205-a+ 65]
<>sons of Sumitra1 were called Laks2man2a and S4atrughna.
<>(Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>10) {%The boon of S4ani (Saturn).%} Astronomers are of
<>opinion that famine will occur in the world for the
<>period of twelve years, when the planet S4ani (Saturn)
<>comes into the orbit of Rohin2i1 (a star). But now the
<>planet Saturn does not come into the orbit of the star
<>Rohin2i1. There is a story in the Padma Pura1n2a, which
<>states that this happened so because of a boon S4ani had
<>given to Das4aratha.
<NI>During the regime of Das4aratha the planet S4ani approa-
<>ched the orbit of Rohin2i1. Experts in astronomy said that
<>the earth would be ruined by famine etc. if S4ani cleft
<>the star Rohin2i1. Hearing this Das4aratha took his bow
<>and arrows, got into his chariot, and started for the
<>firmament. He travelled for one lac and a quarter of
<>yojanas (leagues) and reached the hind part of Rohin2i1,
<>which is beyond the sun. Adorned with golden gar-
<>ments and a golden crown studded with jewels, seated
<>on a golden chariot decorated with precious stones, and a
<>lofty flagpost and yoked with horses of the colour of
<>swan, the king shone in the sky as a second sun. He drew
<>the bow-string right upto his ear and placed in it the
<>arrow of destruction. When the devas and the asuras
<>saw the arrow of destruction they began to tremble with
<>fear. S4ani came to Das4aratha and fell before him and
<>said that he would grant any boon to the King, and
<>requested him to recall the arrow of destruction. Das4a-
<>ratha told S4ani that he only wanted S4ani not to come to
<>the orbit of Rohin2i1. S4ani agreed. From that day onwards
<>S4ani has never entered the orbit of Rohin2i1. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Ka1nd2a, Chapter 34).
<NI>11) {%Death.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a with Si1ta1 went to
<>live in the forest. Sumantra who accompanied them
<>up to the river Ganges, returned to the palace. By
<>then Das4aratha had fallen down filled with grief. He
<>had never recovered from that state of unconsciousness.
<>At the time of his death Bharata and S4atrughna had
<>been away in the kingdom of Kekaya and Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the forest. Thus the curse he incurred
<>in his younger days from the aged hermit, the father of
<>S4ravan2a, was fully realized.
<NI>12) {%Das4aratha appears again.%} Ra1van2a was killed in the
<>battle. Si1ta1 was tested in fire and found sinless. Ra1ma
<>accepted her, seeing that her conjugal fidelity was not
<>marred. At this time S4iva appeared before Ra1ma in a
<>divine aeroplane. Das4aratha was seated in that plane
<>clad in pure garments. He took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>into his lap and embraced them. He blessed them and
<>Si1ta1 who was standing with folded hands. Then Das4a-
<>ratha disappeared. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 122).
<HI>DAS4A1RHA. A king of the Yadu family. He was so famous
<>that his descendants were called the Das4a1rhas. As S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a was born as a descendant in the line of Das4a1rha,

<>‘s4atabhuji1’ etc. The greatest enemies of the A1ryans were
<>the ‘Pan2is’ of these cities. They were a particular class
<>of people of these cities. In the ‘Nirukta of Ya1ska’ it is
<>mentioned that pan2is were traders. Names of many of the
<>Kings of the Dasyus occur in the R2gveda. Dhuni,
<>Cumuri, Pipru, Varcas, S4am3bara and such others are the
<>most valiant and mighty among them. The most impor-
<>tant of the several tribes of the Dasyus were the S4imyus,
<>the Ki1kat2as, S4igrus and the Yaks2us. They are mentioned
<>as the Ana1sas in the R2gveda. (Ana1sas--without nose).
<>Perhaps their nose was flat; more over they are stated as
<>having dark complexion. So it may be assumed that the
<>Dasyus were Dravidians. They talked a primitive
<>language, and they despised sacrificial religion. They did
<>not worship Gods like Indra and others. They possibly
<>worshipped the Phallus, S4iva, Devi and the like.
<HI>DA1TAKACCHA. An ancient country on the bank of
<>the river, Narmada1. (Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>DATTA (DATTAKA). See under Datta1treya.
<HI>DATTAMITRA. This is another name of Sumitra the
<>King of Sauvi1ra. Arjuna, during his conquest of the
<>countries, defeated this King. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 188, Stanza 20).
<HI>DATTA1TMAN. A Vis4vadeva. (A class of gods concerned
<>with sacrifice to the manes). (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,

<HI>DATTA1TREYA. (DATTA). A hermit famous in the
<>pura1n2as.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Anasu1ya1, the wife of hermit Atri gave birth
<>to Datta1treya. But Datta1treya was the incarnation of
<>Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>There is a story in Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a how Maha1-
<>vis2n2u came to incarnate as Datta1treya.
<NI>Once there was a hermit called An2ima1n2d2avya (Ma1n2d2a-
<>vya). While the hermit was engaged in silent medi-
<>tation, some robbers passed by that way. The King's
<>men who were chasing the robbers, came to the hermit
<>and asked him about the robbers. The hermit did not
<>break the silence. The King's men, thinking the hermit
<>to be the thief bound his hands and legs and took him to
<>the palace. The King ordered Ma1n2d2avya to be killed by
<>piercing his body with a trident. Accordingly a trident
<>was posted on a hill far away and Ma1n2d2avya was seated [Page206-b+ 64]
<>on the tip of it. Ma1n2d2avya lay there in agony.
<NI>It was at this time that S4i1lavati1, famous for her conjugal
<>fidelity, went to the house of a harlot, carrying her
<>husband Ugras4ravas on her shoulder. When they passed
<>by that way Ugras4ravas scolded An2ima1n2d2avya; getting
<>angry at this An2ima1n2d2avya cursed Ugras4ravas that he
<>would get his head broken and die before the sun-rise.
<>Si1lavati1 became very sorry when she heard the curse
<>and she also cursed. “Let the sun not rise tomorrow”.
<>The sun did not rise next day. Everything in the world
<>was in chaos. The devas were flurried. They went to
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 took them to S4iva. They could not
<>find a solution. So all of them approached Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Trimu1rtis (three gods) told the devas that the
<>problem would be solved, and the devas returned.
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara went to S4i1lavati1. Before
<>seeing S4i1lavati1, they went to Anasu1ya1 the wife of Atri
<>and sought her help to persuade S4i1lavati1 to recall her
<>curse. Thus Anasu1ya1 and the Trimu1rtis approached
<>S4i1lavati1 and spoke compassionate and consolatory words.
<>At last S4i1lavati1 recalled the curse. The Trimu1rtis con-
<>vinced S4i1lavati1, that Ugras4ravas would not die. The
<>pleased Trimu1rtis asked Anasu1ya1 to ask for any boon. She
<>replied that she did not want any boon except that the
<>Trimu1rtis should take birth as her sons. Accordingly
<>Maha1vis2n2u took birth as Datta1treya, S4iva as Durva1sas
<>and Brahma1 as Candra, in the womb of Anasu1ya1. This
<>is how Datta1treya was born.
<F>1. Datta1treya is known by the name ‘Datta’ also in the Pura1n2as.</F> Datta1treya did penance
<>from his childhood and became a hermit. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 39 to 44).
<NI>2) {%Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and Datta1treya.%} When Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna became King Datta1treya had become very famous.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna wanted to obtain supernatural powers.
<>So he called the hermit Garga and asked for his advice.
<>Garga advised him that Datta1treya was the incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u and that he would grant his wishes. So Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna and his wife came to the river Narmada1,
<>and taking bath in the river, began to worship Datta1-
<>treya, who was doing penance closeby. Datta1treya
<>was pleased and went to Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and asked him
<>what his desire was. He requested for thousand hands
<>and to be a youth for ever, and such other things.
<>Datta1treya granted his wishes. After that Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna would very often go to the hermit Datta1treya for
<>his advice. (Brahma Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>3) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a went to the hermit-
<>age of Datta1treya. The hermit had placed a waterpot
<>purified by reciting spells and incantations. Ra1van2a
<>stole that waterpot. When the hermit knew this, he
<>cursed Ra1van2a saying, “Since the water, which was
<>evoked by spells and incantations, has fallen on your
<>head, Monkeys will pollute your head by treading on
<>it.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Exhortation to the Sa1dhyas.%} Mention is made in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 36, Stanza 4, that the
<>hermit Datta1treya gave exhortations to the Sa1dhyas (the
<>sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Sa1dhya1).
<NI>5) A boon for the birth of Nahus2a. See Nahus2a.
<HI>DATTOLI. A son born to hermit Pulastya by his wife
<>Pri1ti. This Dattoli was in his previous birth, Agastya of
<>the Sva1yam3bhuva manvantara. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a
<>1, Chapter 10).
<HI>DA1YAKRAMA. (INHERITANCE). Da1yakrama is [Page207-a+ 63]
<>the system by which the wealth of parents is received by
<>the heirs. The system of inheritance as described by Manu
<>is as follows:--
<NI>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should
<>divide their wealth among themselves. When either the
<>father or the mother is alive, the sons should not take
<>their wealth.
<NI>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should
<>keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his
<>brothers and sisters like a father.
<NI>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take one-
<>twentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part
<>and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance
<>is to be divided equally among all of them.
<NI>4) If there are more than three sons, the eldest and the
<>youngest may take one-twentieth and one-eightieth (of
<>the entire wealth) respectively, and each of the other
<>brothers may take one-fortieth. The rest of the pro-
<>perty must be divided equally among all of them.
<NI>5) After dividing like this, if there are unmarried sisters,
<>each of the brothers should give one-fourth of his share
<>for their marriage.
<NI>6) The ornaments which the mother had received by
<>way of her dowry etc. may be taken after her death by
<>her unmarried daughters.
<NI>7) If, after his marriage, one of the brothers dies, the
<>brother who keeps his movable and immovable proper-
<>ties, must beget children by the brother's wife and hand
<>over the above properties to her issue. (See under
<>Manusmr2ti).
<HI>D2AYA1NA1KS2ETRA. A famous temple of Goddess Diana
<>in Epheseus. In Greek mythology Diana (Daya1na1) is
<>the goddess of hunting. She is also identified with the
<>Moon Goddess. Being a virgin goddess, she came to be
<>worshipped by virgins who regarded her as their patron.
<>Daya1na1 (Diana) is one of the beautiful daughters of the
<>supreme God, Zeus. Her idol was worshipped in many
<>places in Greece. There was a famous temple of this god-
<>dess in the town of Epheseus. This temple was destroyed
<>in the 3rd Century B.C. by enemies.
<HI>DEVA(S). Gods or deities.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} From time immemorial belief in
<>Devas has existed in every country and all religions have
<>lauded their superior nature and power. It was the
<>Hindus and the Buddhists who first applied the term ‘Deva’
<>to certain very subtle beings recognised in all religions.
<>The Pa1rsi religion (Zaratus2t2ra) has spoken about seven
<>Devara1jans and their attendants. ‘Ames2 pentas’ is the
<>actual term used for the Devara1ja. The Christian reli-
<>gion refers to nine sects of Devas like Sra1fi, Kherubi,
<>Dominion, Angel etc. I1slam refers to four chief Devas
<>viz. Gabriel, the presiding Deva over revelations, Mik-
<>hayel of protection, Asriyal of death and Israfin of resur-
<>ruction. An important section of the R2gveda is Su1ktas
<>about Deva1s like Indra, Mitra, Varun2a, Agni etc. In
<>Yajn5as etc. Devas occupy a very important place. The
<>Kenopanis2ad states that the conceited and haughty Devas
<>were taught a lesson by God. The subject matter of the
<>Kat2hopanis2ad is the advice given by Yama to Naciketas.
<>The Mun2d2akopanis2ad says that the Devas, man and
<>birds originated from God.
<F>1. Tasma1cca deva1h2 bahudha1 samprasu1ta1h2 sa1dhya1h2 manus2ya1h2 pas4avo vaya1m3sah2.</F> There are references about
<>Deva worship in the Smr2tis. The Pura1n2as and Upapu- [Page207-b+ 62]
<>ra1n2as contain scientific discussions, about the origin,
<>work or functions, classes, etc. of Devas. The Mantra-
<>s4a1stra and Tantras4a1stra deal also about the various sects
<>and class of Devas, their nature, and the worship to be
<>offered to them etc.
<NI>2) {%Christian Devas, Satan and devils.%} Christian religious
<>books commonly use the term Ma1la1khas for Devas.
<>Greek mythology contains a story about the Ma1la1khas,
<>who did not obey the orders of Jehovah and how He
<>cursed them, turned them into devils and flung them into
<>hell. And, in hell they organised a revolutionary party
<>to fight Jehovah. Many leaders talked on the subject of
<>how to take vengeance on Jehovah. It was nearabout
<>this period that Jehovah created with the dust on earth
<>Adam as his beloved son and settled him in the garden of
<>Aden. God created from the ribs of Adam the woman
<>called Eve, and they lived in Eden quite happily.
<NI>Satan and other leaders in hell decided that the greatest
<>revenge that could be taken upon Jehovah was to create
<>troubles for his dear son, Adam in Eden. Accordingly
<>Satan went to Eden and made Adam and Eve eat the
<>forbidden fruit with the result that Jehovah cursed and
<>turned them into human beings and turned them out of
<>Eden. Milton in his reputed poem Paradise Lost has told
<>the above story in inimitable language.
<NI>3) {%Indian Devas.%} Most of the Indian Devas are the sons
<>of Kas4yapa Praja1pati by Aditi, daughter of Daks2a Praja1-
<>pati. The total number of Devas is 33 crores. The Devas
<>are divided into many classes or sections like A1dityas,
<>Vis4vadevatas, Vasus, Tus2itas, A1bha1svaras, Anilas, Maha1-
<>ra1jikas, Sa1dhyas, Rudras, Vidya1dharas, Pitr2devas etc.
<>There are further divisions like Apsaras, Viru1pa1ks2as,
<>Bhadras, Gandharvas, Kum3bha1n2d2as, Ra1ks2asas, Na1gas,
<>As4vini1s, Kinnaras, Kim3purus2as, Pis4a1cas, Guhyakas,
<>Siddhas, Ca1ran2as, Matr2s, Ku1s4ma1n2d2as, Bhu1tas, Veta1las,
<>etc. Yet another division is into Lokapa1las, Lipikas etc.
<>The Devas are classified with special reference to
<>bhu1tagan2as like Pr2thvi1 etc. and are, therefore, referred
<>to as Bhu1devata1s, Agnidevata1s, Va1yudevata1s, etc. The
<>presiding spirit of Bhu1devata1s is Kubera, that of the
<>Jaladevata1s is Varun2a, that of the Agnidevata1s, Va1yu-
<>bhagava1n and that of the A1ka1s4adevatas, Indra. And,
<>under them there are various sets of Devas in charge of
<>different departments. Sa1dhyas, Vasus, A1dityas, Apsaras
<>etc. are A1ka1s4adevas, Maruttas and Gandharvas,
<>Va1yudevas. Yaks2as and Yaks2i1s are servants of
<>Kubera. Viru1pa1ks2a, Bhadra etc. are Bhu1devas.
<>Viru1pa1ks2a supports the earth according to the Va1lmi1ki
<>Pura1n2a. Those who protect nidhis (treasures) may also
<>be considered Bhu1midevas.
<NI>There are 33 bosses or presiding spirits for the 33 crores
<>of Devas. Dva1das4a1dityas (12) Eka1das4arudras (11)
<>As2t2avasus (8) and As4vini1devas (2) are the 33 chiefs of
<>Devas. Indra is the chief of all of them.
<NI>4) {%The term Deva.%} The word Deva means light and
<>also play. Devas shine forth, they are also playful.
<>Thus the name is quite apt for them. (See Gra1ma-
<>devata1).
<HI>DEVABHA1GA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Navama Skandha).
<HI>DEVABHA1GAS4RAUTA1RS2A. A r2s2i, the son of S4ruta
<>and learned in yajn5as. He had accurate knowledge as to [Page208-a+ 64]
<>which parts of the yajn5a-cow should be distributed to
<>whom, and till death he did not impart this knowledge
<>to anyone. But, sometime afterwards a non-human
<>individual taught the subject to Girija, son of Babhru.
<>(Aitareya Bra1hman2a).
<NI>At the time when the Sr2n5jayas and the Kuru kings were
<>living in amity consequent upon the da1ks2a1yan2a yajn5a
<>it was this Devabha1ga who acted as the priest of both
<>the parties. His theories on Sa1vitra1gni are quoted in
<>Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a.
<HI>DEVABHRA1T2. An effulgent Devata1 who was the son of
<>Ravi and father of Subhra1t2. (A1di Parva, Chapter 1,
<>Verse 42).
<HI>DEVA1DARS4A. An a1ca1rya in the line of Vya1sa's disciples.
<>He was the disciple of Kabandha, and he had many
<>disciples. Medha1, Brahmabali, Sauta1yana and Pippa-
<>la1da were chief among those disciples. (See genealogy
<>of Gurus).
<HI>DEVADA1RUVANA. A holy centre. A dip in the ti1rtha
<>here is productive of very good results. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 27).
<HI>DEVADA1SA. A rich Vais4ya extolled much in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara. He lived in Pa1taliput2ra and had married the
<>daughter of a very rich Vais4ya of Paun2d2ravardhana. After
<>his father's death Devada1sa lost all his wealth in gamb-
<>ling, and his wife foresook her impecunious husband and
<>returned home.
<NI>After roaming about for some time the helpless Devada1sa
<>decided to go to his wife's house, and one mid-night
<>he went there. While hiding himself there in the darkness
<>he heard his wife telling her paramour the following:
<>“In the four corners of Devada1sa's house are hidden
<>four treasures. But he does not know about the treasures
<>hidden thus by one of his fore-fathers. I got the informa-
<>tion from his mother. You should purchase the pro-
<>perty for a small price.”
<NI>No sooner did Devada1sa hear the above than he
<>hurried back to his house and dug up the treasure
<>and thus became wealthy again. The paramour of his
<>wife went to him a few days later and purchased the
<>property at a heavy price. But, when he dug up the
<>place no treasure was found. Then he wanted to sell
<>back the property to Devada1sa himself, but he refused
<>to purchase it. The case was taken before the King when
<>Devada1sa detailed the whole story. And, as ordered by
<>the King, Devada1sa disfigured his wife and wedded
<>another wife. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3bakam,
<>Taran3ga 5).
<HI>DEVADATTA I. A famous brahmin boy whose story is
<>described in the Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Devadatta was the son of the Brahmin, Haridatta of
<>Kambukapura. Though as a boy Devadatta learnt all
<>the arts and sciences when he grew up to be a youth he
<>became a very wayward fellow. Dice-play became his
<>main job. One day in a game of dice he lost even his
<>clothes, and being afraid of his father, he left the place
<>without returning home.
<NI>Devadatta roamed about, and during one such trip
<>he saw a deserted temple, and a muni called Ja1lapa1da
<>engaged in reciting mantras. Devadatta prostrated be-
<>fore the muni and told him all the details about himself.
<>The muni accepted Devadatta as his s4is2ya and promised
<>to secure vidya1dharahood for him.
<NI>Next night Ja1lapa1da led Devadatta to a burning ghat, [Page208-b+ 64]
<>nearby the temple. After conducting Pu1ja1 in the shade
<>of a fig tree with offerings of Pa1yasa and Vais4va-
<>devabali the muni told Devadatta thus: “You should
<>come here daily and perform pu1ja1 like this, and pray
<>at the close of it, ‘Oh! Vidyutprabha1! please accept my
<>pu1ja1.’
<NI>Devadatta acted according to the above advice of the
<>muni, and one day, at the close of his pu1ja1 the tree broke
<>open into two and a beautiful female who appeared from
<>it took him with her saying that her mistress wanted him.
<>He was thus taken to a house studded with gems wherein
<>he saw a noble lady seated on a cot. She caught Deva-
<>datta by his hands and after seating him alongside said
<>to him: “I am Vidyutprabha1, daughter of the Yaks2a
<>king Ratnavars2a. I am a virgin girl. Muni Ja1lapa1da
<>has worshipped me so much that I have decided to
<>fulfil his desire. I am in love with you and you will
<>please wed me.”
<NI>Accordingly Devadatta married Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>there with her. In due course she conceived, and Deva-
<>datta met Ja1lapa1da and told him about the whole
<>affair, and the muni, to achieve his personal object
<>asked Devadatta to cut open the abdomen of Vidyut-
<>prabha1 and take to him the child found therein. Deva-
<>datta did not at all relish the idea. Yet reluctant to
<>disobey his preceptor he returned to his wife. She permit-
<>ted him to carry out the directions of the muni, yet his
<>mind did not approve of the action. Then Vidyutprabha1
<>herself cut open her abdomen, took the child out of it
<>and placing it before her husband told him thus:--
<>“He who eats the child will become a Vidya1dhara.
<>Take it. I was a Vidya1dhari1 turned into a Yaks2i1 by a
<>curse, and to cut open my abdomen and take out the
<>child like this was the redemption promised me from the
<>curse, and now I go to the Vidya1dhara world; we shall
<>meet there.” And she disappeared.
<NI>In great sorrow Devadatta brought the child to Ja1la-
<>pa1da who, after sending him out on the pretext of his
<>(Ja1lapa1da's) performing Bhairavapu1ja, ate up the child.
<>Devadatta returned and when he knew of the action of
<>his preceptor he was overcome with rage. But the latter
<>rose up to the skies assuming the form of a Vidya1dhara.
<>Devadatta made up his mind to anyhow take revenge
<>upon Ja1lapa1da, and he also went to Vidya1dharaloka with
<>the help of a Veta1la whom he befriended by offering
<>human flesh. And, there he saw Ja1lapa1da drunk with
<>pride at his Vidya1dharahood sitting on a throne of
<>gems in a mansion. Meanwhile Vidyutprabha1 who was
<>now once more a Vidya1dhari1 had turned down the
<>advances made by the erstwhile Ja1lapa1da for her love.
<>But, at the sight of Devadatta her face flushed with love
<>for him while, in fear, the sword fell down from the
<>hands of Ja1lapa1da who now fainted. Devadatta pre-
<>vented the Veta1la from killing Ja1lapa1da and he (Veta1la)
<>at the instance of Devadatta took Ja1lapa1da to the burn-
<>ing ghat and cremated him there.
<NI>Ka1tya1yani1devi1 at this time appeared before Devadatta
<>and pleased with his courage appointed him as chief of
<>the Vidya1dharas. He wedded Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>happily. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Caturda1rika1lam3bakam3,
<>Taran3ga 3).
<HI>DEVADATTA II. A king of ancient India, son of King
<>Jayadatta. Jayadatta wanted to marry his son Devadatta
<>to the daughter of a Vais4ya in Pa1t2ali1putra. Though it [Page209-a+ 65]
<>was a far cry from Pa1t2ali1putra to Jayadatta's court the
<>Vais4ya married his daughter to the prince as he attached
<>much importance to such an alliance with the King.
<>From the dowry given by the Vais4ya to his daughter
<>the resources of her father appeared to be very meagre
<>to Devadatta.
<NI>After some time Devadatta's wife returned to her house
<>with the permission of her husband. During her absence
<>Jayadatta expired, enemies attacked his kingdom and
<>Devadatta with his mother ran away from his kingdom.
<>Sometime after that he started for his wife's house. But,
<>feeling that it would not be proper for him to personally
<>tell his father-in-law about what had happened to him
<>he waited outside an inn near his wife's house, and he
<>had not waited there for long when he saw a woman
<>descending by a cord from the other door of the house.
<>He felt deeply mortified to detect that it was his wife
<>who was thus descending. And, when she, not recognis-
<>ing Devadatta in his dirty clothes, asked him who he
<>was, he answered a ‘traveller’. Taking no notice of this
<>‘traveller’ she got into the inn, and Devadatta followed
<>her. Inside the inn she was met by a man who beat her
<>for being late to go to him; but, in spite of the beating
<>she pleased him with coy words. Then and there Deva-
<>datta divorced her in his mind, but remained there
<>observing their love-making. In the course of their love-
<>play an ear-ring studded with costly gems rolled down
<>the floor from her ears, but she did not notice it. She
<>parted from her paramour before dawn. Devadatta
<>went to Ka1nyakubja with the ear-ring, and there he
<>pledged it for one lakh sovereigns with which money he
<>collected an army and conquered back his lost kingdom.
<>Then he redeemed the pledge and sent the ear-ring to
<>his father-in-law. The whole incident became public.
<>When she realised the fact that the stranger whom she
<>had met at the inn was her own husband, Devadatta's
<>wife felt so deeply hurt and humiliated that her heart was
<>broken and she died. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Narava1hana-
<>datta Janana, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>DEVADATTA III. Father of the reputed muni Utatthya.
<>(Satyatapas). (See Satyatapas.)
<HI>DEVADATTA(M). The divine conch of Arjuna. Maya
<>got this conch from Varun2a and he kept it in the sabha1
<>of Vr2s2aparvan, which was in Bindusaras on Mount
<>Maina1ka to the south of Mount Kaila1sa. When Maya
<>built the palace at Indraprastha for the Pa1n2d2avas he
<>went to Bindusaras and brought for Arjuna that conch
<>called Devadattam, and a club for Bhi1masena. (Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 3).

<>asura. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 26).
<HI>DEVADU1TA. A messenger of the Devas. When Dharma-

<>like Karn2a it was this Devadu1ta with whom Indra sent
<>Dharmaputra to Karn2a and others. (M.B. Svarga1-
<>rohan2a Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 14). This Devadu1ta
<>is to be meditated upon at dawn and before sun-set
<>everyday. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 165, Verse 14).
<HI>DEVADYUMNA. A king of the dynasty of Bharata.
<>From Bharata, son of R2s2abha, was born Sumati, from

<>father of King Parames2t2hi. (Bha1gavata Pan5cama
<>Skandha).
<HI>DEVADYUTI. A R2s2i who dwelt in his a1s4rama on the
<>banks of river S4arasvati1. Owing to the blessing of Vis2n2u
<>a son called Sumitra was born to him. As a result of his
<>doing rigorous tapas for 1000 years he shone with a
<>rare effulgence. Though Vis2n2u appeared to him one
<>day in the month of Vais4a1kha and asked him to choose
<>any boon he wanted, he, who was so much detached in
<>life prayed only for devotion to God. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 212).
<HI>DEVAGAN2A. See Manvantara.
<HI>DEVAGARBHA. A R2s2i. He too was present as one of

<>Rucipraja1pati and Devahu1ti by Kardamapraja1pati
<>and Prasu1ti to Daks2praja1pati. Kapila, the mighty
<>exponent of the Sa1n3khya system of philosophy and great
<>ascetic was the son born to Kardama by Devahu1ti.
<>Kapila taught his mother the world famous Kapila
<>S4a1stra, (Devibha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha) and when the
<>teaching was over he bade farewell to her and took to
<>forest life. And, his mother performed a yajn5a on the
<>lines advised by her son, on the banks of river Sarasvati1.
<>Because she took three baths daily her hairs became a
<>mixture of black and blue in colour and she got emacia-
<>ted due to fasting. She wore the bark of trees. Deva-
<>hu1ti, who realised all the principles and the truth be-
<>came blind to all external objects like gardens, maids,
<>mansions etc. Thus immersed in meditation she in
<>course of time attained siddhi (realisation). The parti-
<>cular spot on the banks of Sarasvati1 where she attained
<>Siddhi is called Siddhapada.

<>But, Kr2s2n2a admonished her and embraced him. At once

<>(corners) dominated by Agni, Nirr2ti, Va1yu and I1s4a1na

<>zones. In that case Va1sudevamu1rti should be installed at
<>the centre. All the Devas bearing the name Ra1ma
<>must be installed to the east of the Pra1sa1da. Lokapa1la-
<>kas like Indra should be installed at the eight places
<>starting with the east. In Pan5ca1yatana pratis2t2ha1 Puru-

<>temporary use, but they also grant all the desires of the

<NI>Stone for idols should be got from mountains. Pa1n2d2ura
<>(white), Arun2a (red), Pi1ta (yellow) and Kr2s2n2a (black)-
<>rocks having any one of these four colours may be
<>selected. If no such stone is available any other stone
<>may be used, but by doing homa and reciting Narasim3ha
<>mantra the attributes of any of the specified varn2as
<>should be transferred to it. It is best to have white
<>markings on the stone selected for the idol. There are
<>the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter with
<>reference to stones. Stone which produces the sound of
<>bell metal on being hit and gives out sparks of fire on
<>being cut is of the masculine gender. Stone which
<>possesses these attributes to a lesser degree is of the
<>feminine gender. Stone with no shape is of neuter gen-
<>der. Beside these three varieties there are the sagarbha
<>(pregnant) stones also, viz. stones with round markings
<>on them, and they should not be used for making idols.
<>Once it is decided to make an idol, Vanayajn5a should
<>be performed first. To worship the forest from which
<>the stone for the idol was to be obtained is vanayajn5a.
<>A specified place in the forest should be dug up, the
<>pit treated with cow-dung and a small platform raised
<>and Vis2n2u worshipped thereon. After sacrificial offerings
<>etc. instruments for the construction of the idol like
<>t2an3ka (chisel) should be worshipped. To sprinkle on
<>the stone s4a1litoya (water in which paddy grains are
<>put) purified with the chanting of astramantra is the
<>next step. After that bhu1tabali (offerings to the spirits
<>of the stone) should be performed upon which the
<>bhu1tas residing inside the stone will quit. Then the
<>a1ca1rya should go to sleep repeating the svapna mantra.

<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 II. A Brahmin, an erudite scholar in the

<>follows:--
<NI>Devas4arman, the very erudite brahmin scholar in the
<>Vedas came to be much respected by the people of the
<>four varn2as (Castes) because of his constant and unfail-
<>ing performance of the various religious duties and
<>rites like the Agnihotra etc. He had sons, relations and
<>cows in abundance. But, he did not observe the s4ukla-
<>pan5cami1 in Pros2t2hapada (Bha1drapada) which is one of [Page212-b+ 65]
<>the dva1das4aca1ndra ma1sas (the 12 solar months).
<>That day was his father's death anniversary (S4ra1ddha
<>day) for which he would invite Brahmins on the pre-
<>vious evening. And, in the morning he would get cook-
<>ed rice by his wife in 18 different ways for the gratifica-
<>tion of the departed soul. Then will he feed the
<>Bra1hmins. On one such day he duly treated a Bra1hmin
<>versed in the Vedas. In the evening when he
<>was washing his feet with water brought by his wife
<>he heard the following conversation between a dog
<>and an ox.
<NI>{%Dog :%}--Please attend to my words about what my
<>daughter-in-law did. One day, as fate would have it,
<>I went to my son's house, where a snake was drinking
<>milk, and I drank the whole of the milk which was left
<>over by it. My daughter-in-law saw me drinking it and
<>I was absolutely crest-fallen. I don't feel any yearning
<>even for food.
<NI>{%Ox :%}--Now dog, please attend to my sorrow and grief.
<>Today my son feasted the Brahmins, but he did not even
<>think of me. Nobody gave me even a blade of grass or
<>a drop of water. I have not tasted anything today.
<>Moreover I am a captive also. All this must be the result
<>of some sin committed by me in my past life; no doubt
<>about it.”
<NI>The very learned and intelligent brahmin inferred from
<>the above talk that the dog and ox were his mother and
<>his father respectively. He thought to himself: they have
<>been born as animals in my house. What remedy shall
<>I find out therefor?
<NI>On account of such painful thoughts the Brahmin could
<>not sleep in the night. Early in the morning he went
<>to sage Vasis2t2ha and unburdened his heart to him and
<>requested him to find a solution to the low and mean
<>birth which had become his parents’ fate. After medita-
<>ting for some time the great sage told the brahmin as
<>follows:--
<NI>“Look here, the ox was, in its previous birth, a great
<>brahmin in Kun2d2inanagara. He did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada, the day
<>being the death anniversary of his father. His wife had
<>menstruation on the same day, but she herself feasted
<>the Brahmins. A woman is impure during the four days
<>of menstruation. Because of having feasted the Brah-
<>mins on the first day of her monthly period the Brah-
<>min's wife was born as a dog. As for the husband, he
<>was born an ox as he not only did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 day, but also shared the sin of his wife.
<>Further questioned by the brahmin as to what he should
<>do for the salvation of his parents, Vasis2t2ha advised him
<>to observe the R2s2i pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada
<>(Bha1drapada). He did so and his parents blessed him
<>and attained salvation. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 78).

<>castles in the air. A brahmaca1ri1 was carrying home in
<>a pot on his head some rice flour. On the way he
<>thought thus: “I will purchase a she-goat with the
<>money I get out of the sale of this rice powder, and
<>it will deliver two kids every year. I will sell all the
<>kids and with the sale proceeds purchase a cow and
<>when it multiplies I will have the wherewithals for cul-
<>tivation and then I will do cultivation in a good field
<>and produce much paddy. And when I have thus money
<>in hand I will renovate my house and marry. We will
<>then have a good son whom I will name Somas4arman,
<>and if my wife, without caring for the boy, goes to milk
<>the cow I will go to the cow shed and give her a good
<>beating. “When his imagination reached this point the
<>pot on his head received, without his knowing, a blow
<>with the stick in his hand and it fell down on the ground
<>and was broken to pieces.”
<NI>Five or six days after telling the above story to her
<>husband Yajn5asena1 gave birth to a child. One day she
<>went to the river to take her bath leaving the child
<>to the care of her husband. Soon after a messenger came
<>from the palace to invite Devas4arman for food, the day
<>being Ama1vasi1 when Brahmins were fed well and also
<>given daks2in2a1, (presents of money). He could not wait
<>till his wife arrived; the child became a problem to
<>him.
<NI>The brahmin had a beloved Mongoose. After entrusting
<>the child to the care of it the Brahmin went to the
<>palace. Within a short time a serpent was seen crawling
<>towards the child and the Mongoose attacked it and
<>bit it into pieces. Naturally the Mongoose got itself
<>smeared all over with the blood of the serpent, and the
<>brahmin on returning home finding the Mongoose bath-
<>ed in blood thought it might have eaten the child
<>and in a rage he killed the poor Mongoose. But, when
<>he entered the room and found pieces of the killed ser-
<>pent strayed all over there truth and light dawned on
<>him. Yajn5asena1, who had returned after bath by now
<>also found fault with him.
<NI>{%The second story.%} Once there was a Brahmin in very indi-
<>gent circumstances. He was an orphan from his very
<>childhood. One day while he was asleep quite weary
<>and tired as he had no food that day some one
<>appeared and told him in a dream that three sannya1sins
<>would come to his house that noon and that if beaten to
<>death they would turn into three pot-fulls of treasure
<>with which he could live comfortably well.
<NI>His dream came true, and he locked up the treasure in
<>his room after sending away a barber who had witnessed
<>the incident with a piece of gold. The barber returned
<>home cherishing in his mind the false belief that sann-
<>ya1sins beaten to death would turn into pot-fulls of
<>treasure. And, one day some sannya1sins came to his
<>house and he began beating them and they ran out
<>crying aloud. Their cries attracted the attention of the
<>servants of the King. The barber's limbs were cut off
<>and he was killed on S4u1la (a three-pronged weapon).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 V. A Brahmin, who used to perform rites
<>for the dead at the confluence of the sea every fortnight. [Page213-b+ 65]
<NI>On every such occasion souls of the departed used to ap-
<>pear and bless him. Once Devas4arman went to Pitr2loka
<>with his pitr2s, and he got restless and sorry to find other
<>pitr2s living there in greater comfort than the pitr2s of
<>his parents. When he was told that the better fate of
<>the other pitr2s was due to their sons performing S4ra1ddha
<>at Mahi1sa1garasan3gama he returned to earth and with the
<>help of other people did S4ra1ddha at the san3gamaand
<>thus raised the condition of his pitr2s. (Skandha Pura1n2a.
<>Skandhas 1, 2 and 3).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 VI. A Brahmin who lived on the nor-
<>thern side of river Ka1veri1. The following story about
<>him is told in chapters 2, 4 and 12 of the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>One day in the month of Ka1rttika he asked his son to
<>bathe. The son refused to obey his father, who got
<>angry at the disobedience of the son and cursed him to be
<>turned into a rat. But, when the son begged his pardon
<>he said that the boy would resume his old form when
<>he heard about the greatness of Ka1rttika.
<NI>While the Brahmin, thus turned into rat, was roaming
<>about in the forest it saw Vis4va1mitra mahars2i seated
<>under a tree with his disciples. The mahars2i was telling
<>the disciples about the greatness of Ka1rttika. The Brah-
<>min boy--turned cat--heard the story and reverted to
<>its old form as the Brahmin boy.
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 VII. See Ma1ya1 S4iva.
<HI>DEVASATTRA(M). A yajn5a. (See Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 84, Verse 68).
<HI>DEVASENA I. A very intelligent king who ruled his
<>country with S4ra1vasti1 as his capital. (See Unma1dini1).
<HI>DEVASENA. II. Husband of Ki1rtisena1. (See Ki1rtisena1).
<HI>DEVASENA1. Daks2a's daughter and wife of Subrah-
<>man2ya and a woman of rare beauty and purity. Dait-
<>yasena1 and Devasena1, daughters of Daks2a, used to
<>enjoy themselves at Ma1nasa saras. One day Kes4i1, the
<>asura saw them and craved for their love. Daityasena1
<>agreed to become his wife, but Devasena1 refused, and
<>she prayed for the help of Indra, who happened to
<>come there at the moment. Indra and Kes4i1 fought
<>with each other. Kes4i1 used the club against Indra, who
<>broke it into two with his vajra1yudha. Then Kes4i1 hurled
<>a mountain at Indra, who cut it also. Frightened to
<>death Kes4i1 then ran away with Daityasena1 to safety,
<>and Devasena1 expressed her desire to Indra to have
<>one who could defeat the Devas, Da1navas and Yaks2as
<>as her husband. But, Indra could not find such a one
<>in the whole universe. Indra told Brahma1 about it.
<>The Devas put their heads together and brought forth
<>Subrahman2ya from S4iva to be her husband. In the
<>war between the Devas and the asuras Devasena1 helped
<>Subrahman2ya, and the asuras were completely destro-
<>yed. (Vana Parva, Chapters 223, 224).
<HI>DEVAS4I1LA1. See Gaya1ti1rtha.
<HI>DEVASMITA1. A Gem of a woman who was much devoted
<>to her husband. The story of Devasmita1 has been so
<>often quoted in ancient Indian literature. She was the
<>daughter of a Vais4ya called Dharmagupta and was
<>married to Guhasena, son of a Vais4ya called Dhana-
<>datta, who belonged to Ta1mraliptinagara.
<NI>After the death of his father Guhasena decided to go to
<>Kat2a1hadvi1pa for trade, and Devasmita1, a very suspici-
<>ous wife, objected to it. When his other relations began
<>pressing him to go to the dvi1pa for trade and his wife
<>not to go, Guhasena could not take a decision on the [Page214-a+ 65]
<>matter. He began a penance so that God might take
<>the decision in the matter. Devasmita1 also followed
<>him. Then God appeared to them in their dreams
<>and gave each of them a red lotus flower saying, “both
<>of you keep one flower each with you, and while both
<>of you are away from each other if either of you go
<>astray the lotus flower in the hands of the other
<>person will fade.” And, on awaking both of them had
<>a flower in their hands. Guhasena with his flower in
<>his hands started for Kat2a1hadvi1pa, and Devasmita1 sta-
<>yed at home with her eyes fixed on her lotus flower.
<>Guhasena reached the dvi1pa and traded in gems. Every-
<>body was surprised to find in his hands a lotus flower
<>which never faded. Four Vais4ya youngsters wanted to
<>understand the secret of it and one day they invited
<>Guhasena to their house and treated him to liquor very
<>liberally. When he got absolutely drunk they question-
<>ed him about the secret of the lotus flower, and he,
<>though in indistinct words, explained it to them. When
<>the secret was thus out all the four youngsters decided
<>to seduce his wife. They extracted from him the infor-
<>mation that he was not returning in the near future,
<>and they then came to Ta1mralipti.
<NI>At that time there lived in Ta1mralipti a bogus Sannya1-
<>sini1 (a female anchorite) called Yogakaran2d2ika1. The four
<>youths from Kat2a1hadvi1pa visited her, and she under-
<>took to fulfil their desire. She asked them to halt at her
<>house and then went to Devasmita1 with some refreshments.
<>Devasmita1's bitch barked very violently at the bogus an-
<>chorite when she told the former thus:--“Child! don't
<>you see the bitch barking at my very sight. The bitch is
<>crying thinking of her previous birth at my sight. Her-
<>self (the bitch) and I were, in our last birth, the wives
<>of a Brahmin. Since our husband was a courtier at the
<>palace often he was away from home and in his absence
<>I used to satisfy the cravings of sex by associating freely
<>with other males. I had even at that time realised the
<>truth that there was no duty higher than satisfying the
<>senses, and so I am now reborn with memories of the
<>past life. As for this bitch in her past life as co-wife with
<>me of the Brahmin, she sinned against her sense-organs
<>by upholding, in ignorance, her chastity, as a punish-
<>ment for which she was born as dog in this life. Yet, she
<>remembers her past.
<NI>Though Devasmita1 saw through the false and trea-
<>cherous heart of the bogus anchorite, without expres-
<>sing it she talked in all respect with her. Believing that
<>she had succeeded in her mission she told Devasmita1
<>about the four youths who had come from Kat2a1ha-
<>dvi1pa, and Devasmita1 welcomed the idea very gladly.
<NI>Devasmita1 got some liquor and mixed poison in it.
<>When it was night one of the Vais4ya youths came, and
<>after rendering him unconscious by administering the
<>poisoned liquor to him Devasmita1 stripped him of all
<>his clothes and ornaments, got him scratched on the
<>brows by the bitch and threw him into a cow dung
<>heap. Before it was dawn next day he returned to the
<>anchorite's house, took a bath and dressed himself up in
<>decent clothings. His other three companions also visi-
<>ted Devasmita1 one after the other in the next three
<>days, and they too underwent the same experience as the
<>first one. Lastly the bogus sannya1sini1 also was got down
<>and Devasmita1 cut her limbs and sent her away. And,
<>after this Devasmita1 put on the garb of a merchant and
<>went to Kat2a1hadvi1pa and identified her husband from [Page214-b+ 65]
<>among a thousand merchants. Guhasena too felt his
<>own doubts about her identity. But, without revealing
<>her identity she saw the king and told him that she had
<>certain matters to submit before the praja1paris2at (popu-
<>lar assembly). The King accordingly convened a session
<>of the assembly and Devasmita1 identified the four youths
<>who had tried to seduce her and submitted all details
<>regarding the episode. The King then gave her a lot of
<>money, appointed the four youths as her servants and
<>sent her back home with Guhasena. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Katha1mukhalam3bakam, Taran3ga 5).

<HI>DEVA1SURAYUDDHA(S) Wars between the gods and
<>asuras. Altogether twelve wars were fought between
<>the Devas and the asuras, viz. Narasim3ha, Va1mana,
<>Vara1ha, Amr2tamathana, Ta1raka1maya, A1d2i1baka, Trai-
<>pura, Andhaka, Vadha, Vr2travadha, Dhvajapa1ta,
<>Ha1la1hala and Kola1hala. Hiran2yakas4ipu, the daitya
<>was killed by Narasim3ha. Va1mana took Maha1bali
<>captive after measuring the three worlds in one stride.
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a was killed in fighting in the sea by Vara1ha
<>with its tusks. Indra defeated Prahla1da and in the
<>Ta1raka1maya war also killed his son Virocana who had
<>planned to kill him (Indra). As the Devas could not
<>kill the da1navas of Tripura, Trilocana killed them.
<>Vr2tra who was aided by the da1navas was killed by
<>Indra with the help of Vis2n2u. Indra himself killed
<>Vipracitti and his followers who became invisible by
<>ma1ya1 after the felling of the dhvaja (flag staff), and in
<>the course of celebrating their victory the Devas defeat-
<>ed S4an2d2a1marka at the yajn5a1vabhr2tha (Bathing at the
<>close of the yajn5a). Thus were waged twelve wars
<>between the Devas and the Asuras. (Padma Pura1n2a,

<HI>DEVAVRATA II. A brahmin who believed in yajn5as.
<>He once received without due regard and with indif-
<>ference the ti1rtha water given to him by a devotee of

<HI>DEVAYA1NI1. Sukra1ca1rya's daughter.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Sva1yambhuvamanu, son of Brahma1 had two
<>sons: Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da. Priyavrata wedded
<>Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1, two very beautiful daughters
<>of Vis4vakarmapraja1pati, and he had by Suru1pa1 ten
<>sons called Agni1dhra, Idhmajihva1, Yajn5aba1hu,
<>Maha1vi1ra, Rukmasukra, Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1-
<>tithi, Vi1tihotra and Kavi as also a daughter called
<>U1rjasvati1 who was the youngest of the whole lot. Of
<>the above ten sons Kavi, Savana and Maha1vi1ra were
<>spiritual giants and great sages. Uttama, Ta1pasa and
<>Raivata, the three sons of Priyavrata by his second wife
<>Barhis2mati1 turned out to be manvantara1dhipatis.
<>U1rjasvati1, the only daughter of Priyavrata was married
<>to S4ukra1ca1rya, preceptor of the asuras. Devaya1ni1 was
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's daughter by U1rjasvati1. (Devi1bha1gavata,
<>As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Curse by Kaca.%} Kaca, son of Br2haspati became
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's disciple to learn Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 vidya1
<>(the science to ward off death for ever). Devaya1ni1
<>fell madly in love with Kaca. But, after his studies
<>under her father were over Kaca returned to devaloka
<>without marrying Devaya1ni1, who cursed that Kaca's [Page215-b+ 65]
<>learning should prove useless. And, Kaca cursed her
<>in return that nobody from devaloka should marry
<>her. (For details see Kaca).
<NI>3) {%Devaya1ni1 in a neglected well.%} Once Vr2s2aparvan was the
<>king of the asuras, and S4ukra1ca1rya lived in his palace.
<>S4armis2t2ha1, the daughter of the king and Devaya1ni1, the
<>daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya became thick friends. While
<>one day these two friends with their companions were
<>engaged in water sports Indra came that way. Very
<>much interested in seeing the deva damsels thus engaged
<>in water sports Indra assumed the form of air and blew
<>off the dresses of the damsels from the shore while they
<>were playing in the river. The damsels hurriedly got
<>out of water, ran after the fleeing garments and put
<>on whatever came to their hands. In the confusion what
<>S4armis2t2ha1 got and wore was Devaya1ni1's clothes. Devaya1ni1
<>ran after S4armis2t2ha1 and caught hold of the clothes, but
<>the latter did not yield them to her. Both of them
<>indulged in hot words against each other, S4armis2t2ha1
<>calling S4ukra1ca1rya a beggar living in her father's
<>palace for his food. Not only that, she pushed Devaya1ni1
<>into a neglected well and went her way.
<NI>At that time prince Yaya1ti, son of Nahus2a, was hunting
<>in that forest. Feeling very thirsty he came to the well
<>for a drink and therein saw Devaya1ni1 in tears. He
<>brought her out from the well and leaving her there
<>went on his way.
<NI>S4ukra1ca1rya and his wife actually got anxious and upset
<>that their daughter had not returned even after the
<>lapse of so much time and deputed their servant
<>Gurn2ika1 to seek for Devaya1ni1. She found her out in
<>the forest. But, Devaya1ni1 refused to return home as
<>she did not want to continue as the daughter of one
<>who lived on the charity of S4armis2t2ha1 and her father.
<>Gurn2ika1 carried back this news to S4ukra1ca1rya, who then
<>went himself to the forest and met his daughter. He
<>felt deeply wounded to hear about the insults heaped
<>on his daughter by S4armis2t2ha1, and sent word to
<>Vr2s2aparvan that they were not returning to the palace.
<>Vr2s2aparvan realised that if S4ukra1ca1rya quarrelled
<>with him the whole asura world also would become
<>divided. He, therefore, tried his best to pacify the
<>a1ca1rya and his daughter. At last Devaya1ni1 agreed to re-
<>turn to the palace in case S4armis2t2ha1 went to her with one
<>thousand of her maids to serve as her (Devaya1ni1's) maids.
<>Vr2s2aparvan acted accordingly and Devaya1ni1 was
<>satisfied and returned to the palace with her father.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 78 onwards.)
<NI>4) {%Wedding of Devaya1ni1.%} Some time afterwards when
<>Devaya1ni1 was sporting in the forest with S4armis2t2ha1 and
<>others, King Yaya1ti happened to pass that way. They
<>recognised each other and Devaya1ni1 requested Yaya1ti
<>to marry her as she had mentally chosen him as her
<>husband on the very same day on which he had saved
<>her from the well.
<NI>Yaya1ti realised only too well that it was really danger-
<>ous to marry the daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya in the forest
<>secretly and he, therefore, rejected Devaya1ni1's request.
<>But, she got down her father there and with his per-
<>mission Yaya1ti married her. He also got much wealth
<>by way of dowry. S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids accompanied
<>Devaya1ni1 but Sukra1ca1rya warned Yaya1ti that on no
<>account should he touch S4armis2t2ha1.
<NI>With his wife and her attendants Yaya1ti returned to
<>his palace; but he put S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids in [Page216-a+ 70]
<>a place newly built for the purpose. Devaya1ni1 delivered
<>a child in due course and it was named Yadu. S4armis2-
<>t2ha1 one day met Yaya1ti in the forest and requested
<>for a child by him. Though at first he was reluctant to
<>oblige remembering only too well the injunction of
<>S4ukra1ca1rya, he at last succumbed to the eloquence of
<>S4armis2t2ha1. She got pregnant by him and the child
<>she delivered was called Druhyu.
<NI>Devaya1ni1 was alarmed at the birth of a child to
<>S4armis2t2ha, who was unmarried, and questioned her
<>about it. S4armis2t2ha1's answer that a brahmin stranger,
<>who came that way was the father of her child satisfied
<>Devaya1ni1.
<NI>Ere long another son, Turvasu, was born to Devaya1ni1,
<>and S4armis2t2ha1 too delivered two children called
<>Anudruhyu and Pu1ru. Thus the mistress (Devaya1ni1)
<>had two sons and her servant, S4armis2t2ha1 three sons.
<NI>While Yaya1ti and Devaya1ni1 were one day strolling in
<>the garden the sons of S4armis2t2ha1 came there. She
<>noticed the close resemblance of those boys to her
<>husband (Yaya1ti) and it kindled her wrath. Though
<>Yaya1ti did not, because of the presence of Devaya1ni1,
<>notice the children, when she asked them who their
<>father was, they answered “Yaya1ti”, whereupon in
<>great rage she ran up to her father. Yaya1ti too followed
<>her. Devaya1ni1 told her father about the infidelity of
<>Yaya1ti and he (S4ukra) cursed that Yaya1ti be afflicted
<>with old age. When Yaya1ti asked for redumption from
<>the curse S4ukra1ca1rya told him that he could exchange
<>his old age for the youth of somebody else.
<NI>Yaya1ti then called together all his five sons and asked
<>them whether anyone of them was prepared to exchange
<>his (son's) youth for his (Yaya1ti's) old age for one
<>thousand years. The three elder sons refused to agree
<>to the proposal, but the fourth son Pu1ru gladly exchan-
<>ged his youth with his father's old age. After spending
<>his life in youthful enjoyment for one thousand
<>years Yaya1ti returned his youth to Pu1ru, and Pu1ru
<>assumed Kingship of the country. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>81-83).

<NI>And, the Devi1 spoke to Maha1vis2n2u as follows:--After
<>all, what is there to be wondered at. Whenever the
<>world faced the phenomenon of Sr2s2t2isthitilaya (crea-
<>tion, existence and absorption into the primordial force)
<>you too have come up due to the power of Maha1s4akti.
<>As for Para1s4akti (the ultimate, universal force) it is
<>above and beyond all attributes. We, all of us, possess
<>attributes. From the na1bhi (navel) of yourself in whom
<>sattvagun2a (gentle attributes) predominates will be
<>born Brahma1 in whom rajogun2a (active attributes)
<>will predominate, and from the centre of his brows
<>will be born Rudra with tamogun2a (black, destructive
<>attributes). Brahma1, by the force of his tapas will earn
<>powers of creation and will with his rajogun2a create
<>the world blood-red in colour, and you will be the
<>sustainer and guardian of that world. The very same
<>world will be annihilated by Rudra at the end of the
<>Kalpa era. You please do know that I am the sa1ttvic
<>force which depend on you for the purpose of creation.
<>All creations of worlds have been made according to
<>the suggestions of Devi1.
<NI>2) {%Origin of Devi1.%} Once King Janamejaya questioned
<>Vya1sa about the birth of Devi1 to which he replied as
<>follows:--
<NI>Even Brahma1vis2n2umahes4varas (Brahma1, Vis2n2u and
<>S4iva--the Hindu trinity) are not capable of thinking
<>about the origin of Devi1. Then, what about me? Yet
<>let me make an attempt. All the forces--everything--
<>which appear in various names and forms are in fact
<>Devi1 herself, her different manifestations. Just as a
<>master actor appears on the stage in different roles for
<>the delectation of the audience the formless Devi1, on
<>behalf of the Devas, assumes many forms and imposes
<>upon herself attributes though in fact she is without any
<>attribute whatsoever. Thus, depending on her various
<>forms, actions etc. she is addressed by different names.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Five forms of Devi1.%} When primordial nature (Mu1la-
<>prakr2ti) incarnated or manifested in the form of Vis2n2u
<>the desire for creation raised its head in him. And, at
<>once the Devi1--female--aspects in Vis2n2u manifested
<>in five forms like Durga1, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1, Sa1vitri1 and
<>Ra1dha1. These five forms are designated as the
<>Pan5cadevi1s. Brief notes on the five Devi1s are given
<>below.
<NI>(1) {%Durga1devi1.%} Mother of Gan2es4a bhagava1n. (God with
<>the elephant's head). She is the consort of S4iva.
<>Na1ra1yan2i1, the Vis2n2uma1ya1, is none else than Durga1.
<>She is also perfect Brahma, the one and the only one
<>with no second to it. She is worshipped by Devas like
<>Brahma1 and by sages and mahars2is. She is the basis,
<>the root and root cause of everything. She is eternal,
<>upholder of dharma, truth itself and the giver and
<>promoter of happiness, reputation, welfare, salvation
<>etc. as also of sorrow, grief, pain etc. She takes great [Page217-a+ 64]
<>preasure in removing the worries and sorrows of devo-
<>tees who seek refuge in her. She is all-power, achieve-
<>ments and assets personified. All imaginable permuta-
<>tions and combinations of every attribute comprise in
<>her and she it is who activates the universal soul.
<NI>2) {%Laks2mi1.%} This Devi1 is the most sublime form of the
<>universal soul, nay, the universal soul itself. She is all
<>wealth and riches personified, and she is the very seat of
<>beauty, compassion, welfare, peace, all goodness etc.
<>Evil traits like anger, avarice, haughtiness etc. are miles
<>away from her. She is all sympathy and kindness
<>towards her devotees. In Vaikun2t2ha, as Maha1laks2mi1 she
<>is ever engaged in the service of her husband, Vis2n2u.
<>In heaven she is the very glory of it. In houses she
<>appears as the welfare and prosperity of the inmates.
<>She is in fact beauty itself and is the essence of beauty
<>everywhere. She is all-merciful, and worshipped by
<>all.
<NI>(3) {%Sarasvati1.%} She is very base and fountain head of and
<>the presiding deity of the word, intellect, knowledge,
<>the arts etc. She also is of the form of the universal
<>soul and liberally grants intellect, poetical skill, reason
<>and logic, understanding capacity etc. to her devotees.
<>The finest music with all its beauties originates from
<>her. Yes, she is the goddess of all learning, fine arts and
<>every branch of knowledge. Like the ice piece, the
<>Jasmine flower etc. she is beautiful in her white cover.
<>She recited the holy names of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. She is of the
<>form of tapas and blesses those who perform it. In fact,
<>she it is who grants all gifts and powers of understand-
<>ing. She is the goddess of language and learning (Va1n2i1-
<>ma1ta1) and without her human beings would lose their
<>capacity to speak.
<NI>(4) {%Sa1vitri1devi1.%} She is mother of the four varn2as (castes,
<>classes) Veda1n3gas, the ta1ntric science etc. She is of
<>the form of Japa (chanting of holy names and mantras),
<>tapas, the effulgence of Brahman, the very essence of
<>truth and existence and supreme bliss. She is eternal
<>and grants salvation. She forms the very basis and pith
<>and core of the glowing presence of the universal soul.
<>This world is pure, and has been purified by the touch
<>of the sacred feet of this Devi1.
<NI>(5) {%Ra1dha1devi1.%} Ra1dhika1devi1, fifth of the pan5caprakr2tis is
<>the presiding deity over the five pra1n2as and She is of
<>the form of those pra1n2as. She is exceptionally beautiful
<>endowed with all fortunes and happiness, sublime and
<>serious, and the consort of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and as eternal
<>and equally endowed with divine attributes as the lord.
<>She is formless also, above and beyond attributes,
<>unattached and detached, and not visible even to the
<>great Devas and munis by the naked eye. Her clothes
<>even Agni would not burn. She was born, in Va1ra1ha
<>Kalpa as the daughter of Vr2s2abha1nu, and because her
<>sacred feet trod over this land, Bha1rata (India) became
<>holy. Once Brahma1 did tapas for 60,000 years to have
<>a glimpse of the Devi1's lotus feet, but could not. People
<>were able to see her only after she, in unbounded com-
<>passion for the world, incarnated herself in Vr2nda1vana
<>(See Prakr2ti).
<NI>4) {%Am3s4aru1pa(s)--partial manifestations of Devi1.%} The
<>above discussion was concerned with the five forms of the
<>Devi1 in her full and complete forms. Now, there are
<>six other Devi1s, who are partial manifestations or born
<>from certain parts of the Devi1. [Page217-b+ 64]
<NI>(1) {%Gan3ga1devi1.%} This Devi1 who flows in the form of
<>water and washes off men's sins takes her origin from
<>the body of Maha1vis2n2u. (There is another story which
<>traces Gan3ga1's origin to the An2d2a (egg or seed) of
<>Brahma1). (See Gan3ga1).
<NI>(2) {%Tulasi1.%} She is the lover and also the servant at
<>the feet of Vis2n2u. She also washes off men's sins and
<>promotes their welfare. (See Tulasi1).
<NI>(3) {%Manasa1devi1%} Manasa1devi1, who was born as a dau-
<>ghter of Kas4yapa is another partial incarnation of
<>Maha1ma1ya1. She is a great tapasvini1, a favourite dis-
<>ciple of S4an3kara, unique in learning and erudition,
<>sister of Ananta (the king of Serpents), the presiding
<>deity of Mantras, wife of Jaratka1ru muni and mother
<>of A1sti1ka muni. (See Manasa1devi1).
<NI>(4) {%Devasena1devi1.%} Since this Devi1 has been born out of a
<>sixth part of Maha1ma1ya1 she is called S2as2t2hi1devi1 also. It
<>is this Devi1, who gives children to living beings and also
<>protects them. For one year from the birth of a child
<>this Devi1 should be worshipped. Those who cannot
<>afford it should worship Devi1 on the 6th or 21st day
<>after a child is born. (See Devasena1).
<NI>(5) {%Man3galacan2d2ika1.%} She is born from the face of
<>Mu1laprakr2ti. Anybody who propitiates and pleases
<>her will be the recipient of all good things like sons and
<>grandsons, wealth, reputation, welfare etc. (See Man3-
<>galacan2d2ika1).
<NI>(6) {%Bhu1midevi1.%} She is the basis for all things, soil for
<>the origin of the vegetable kingdom, the treasure
<>house of all gems and the very incarnation of compas-
<>sion and sympathy. (See Bhu1midevi1).
<NI>5) {%Am3s4akala1devi1(s).%} Another class of devi1s who are
<>also partial manifestations of the Supreme Devi1. They
<>are born out of the parts of Maha1devi1. The following
<>are the Am3s4akala1devi1s.
<NI>(1) {%Sva1ha1devi1.%} Consort of Agni Bhagava1n (Fire God).
<>Sva1ha1 is worshipped in all the worlds. If havis (obla-
<>tion) is offered without repeating her name the Devas
<>will not accept it.
<NI>(2) {%Daks2in2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is wor-
<>shipped by all. Without this Devi1 all Karmans (actions)
<>in the world will become futile.
<NI>(3) {%Di1ks2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is worshipp-
<>ed by all.
<Poem>Di1yate vimalam3 jn5a1nam
<>Ks2i1yate karmava1sana1 /
<>Tena di1ks2eti sa1 prokta1.</Poem>
<>The Devi1 grants pure knowledge.
<NI>(4) {%Svadha1devi1.%} Wife of the Pitr2s, worshipped by manes
<>and men. Offerings made to the Pitr2s without honour-
<>ing this Devi1 will prove to be futile.
<NI>(5) {%Svastidevi1.%} Consort of the Va1yu. When offering Daks2in2a1
<>and making divya-da1na (divine gifts) if ‘Svasti’ (may
<>good happen) is not uttered the gifts will be of no use.
<NI>(6) {%Pus2t2idevi1.%} Wife of Gan2apati. If this Devi1 ceased to
<>exist men and women would become feeble, because
<>she is the source of all strength.
<NI>(7) {%Tus2t2idevi1.%} Consort of Ananta worshipped by every-
<>body. If the Devi1 ceased to exist there would be no
<>happiness in the world.
<NI>(8) {%Sampatti devi1.%} Wife of I1s4a1na. Worshipped by Devas
<>and men. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become poor and indigent.
<NI>(9) {%Dhr2ti.%} Consort of Kapila. Everybody worships her [Page218-a+ 64]
<>all the time. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become timid and cowardly.
<NI>(10) {%Sati1devi1.%} Wife of Satya. Well-wisher of all, this
<>Devi1 is worshipped by muktas. (people released from
<>worldly attachments). If the Devi1 ceased to exist there
<>would be no friendship and amity between people.
<NI>(11) {%Daya1devi1.%} Wife of Moha. If the Devi1 ceased to
<>exist the world would become hellish and a fierce battle
<>field.
<NI>(12) {%Pratis2t2ha1devi1.%} Wife of Pun2ya. In the absence of
<>this Devi1, who grants good and happy results to people's
<>actions the whole world would become as though it
<>were dead.
<NI>(13) {%Siddhadevi1.%}
<NI>(14) {%Ki1rtidevi1.%} Both the Devi1s, Siddha1 and Ki1rti are
<>wives of Sukarma1. If they ceased to exist the whole
<>world would be bereft of reputation and become lifeless
<>like a dead body.
<NI>(15) {%Kriya1devi1.%} Wife of Udyoga. If she ceased to exist
<>the whole world would become inactive and cease to
<>function.
<NI>(16) {%Mithya1d2evi1.%} Wife of Adharma. Wayward and
<>characterless people worship this Devi1. If the Devi1
<>ceased to exist the whole world as evolved by Brahma1
<>would cease to exist. This Devi1 was not seen anywhere
<>in the world during Kr2tayuga. She began to appear
<>in a subtle form here and there during Treta1yuga. In
<>dva1parayuga she attained more growth and then her
<>limbs and organs became doubly strong. In Kaliyuga
<>she developed to her full stature and growth and goes
<>about everywhere with her brother, Cheat (Kapat2a).
<NI>(17) {%S4a1ntidevi1.%} (see below).
<NI>(18) {%Lajja1devi1.%} Both the Devi1s, S4a1nti and Lajja1 are good-
<>natured wives. If they ceased to exist the world would
<>become dull and sleepy.
<NI>(19-20-21) {%Buddhidevi1, Medha1devi1%} and {%Dhr2tidevi1.%} These
<>three Devi1s are wives of Jn5a1na. If they ceased to exist
<>the world would become steeped in ignorance and
<>foolishness.
<NI>(22) {%Mu1rti.%} Wife of Dharma. She is very beautiful and
<>effulgent. In her absence the universal soul would be-
<>come devoid of vitality, helpless and meaningless.
<NI>(23) {%S4ri1devi1.%} Wife of Ma1li1. Her absence will make the
<>world lifeless.
<NI>(24) {%Nidra1devi1.%} Wife of Ka1la1gni. The Devi1, a sage
<>who has attained realisation, affects everybody in the
<>world during night and makes them lose consciousness
<>and plunges them in sleep. In the absence of this Devi1
<>the world will become a lunatic asylum.
<NI>(25-26-27) {%Ra1tri1, Sandhya1%} and {%Divasa1.%} These three are the
<>wives of Time (Ka1la). In their absence nobody would
<>have any sense of time and none would be able to cal-
<>culate and fix time.
<NI>(28-29) {%Vis4appu%} and {%Da1ham.%} Vis4appu = hunger.
<>Da1ham = thirst. These two Devi1s are the wives of
<>greed (Lobha). They go about the world affecting
<>people and thus making them worried and miserable.
<NI>(30-31) {%Prabha1devi1%} and {%Da1hika1 devi1%} are the wives of
<>Tejas (Vitality). Without them I1s4vara will find it im-
<>possible to continue the function of creation.
<NI>(32-33) {%Mr2tyu%} and {%Jara1%} are the consorts of Prakr2s2t2a-
<>jvara and daughters of Ka1la. And, if they cease to exist,
<>Brahma1's creation would also cease. (For Brahma1's
<>creation individual souls with the will for action are [Page218-b+ 65]
<>necessary. He cannot create a soul of his own. So
<>death is a pre-condition of creation, birth. If there is
<>no death there is no birth also. There is a school of
<>thought which maintains that if there is no death but
<>only birth there will not be space on earth for the living,
<>and therefore birth will stop if there is no death.).
<NI>(34-35) {%Tandra1%} and {%Pri1ti%} are the daughters of Nidra1 and
<>consorts of Sukha (pleasure, happiness). These Devi1s go
<>around the world on the orders of Brahma1.
<NI>(36-37) {%S4raddha1%} and {%Bhakti%} are the consorts of Vaira1gya
<>(aversion to wordly comforts, renunciation) and they
<>give salvation to the souls of the people in the world.
<NI>Aditi, mother of the Devas, Diti, mother of the Asuras,
<>Surabhi, mother of cows, Kadru1, mother of serpents
<>and Vinata1, mother of Garud2as are also involved in the
<>process of creation, and they are born out of parts of
<>Devi1.
<NI>6) {%Idol of Devi1.%} There are special injunctions for mak-
<>ing idols of the Devi1 for installation in temples. Can2d2i-
<>ka1devi1 should have twenty hands. The hands on the
<>right side should hold S4u1la, sword, disc, cord,
<>d2amaru, s4akti etc. and the hands on the left side should
<>hold na1gapa1s4a, flag, club, mirror etc. (There are also
<>idols with slight differences from the above).
<NI>Laks2mi1devi1 would hold in her right hand the lotus
<>flower and a Ku1vala fruit in the left. Sarasvati1devi1 will
<>have in her hands books, aks2ama1la1 and vi1n2a1. Gan3ga1devi1
<>rides on a makaramatsya (fish) holding in her hands
<>a pot and lotus flowers. Yamuna1devi1 rides the turtle
<>with a pot in hand and she is blue in colour.
<NI>Now, about the saptama1tr2s. Tumburu, white in colour,
<>and mounted on an ox rests on a s4u1la with vi1n2a1 in hand
<>before the Ma1tr2s. Among the Ma1tr2s Bra1hmi1 has four
<>faces, wears the aks2ama1la1 and holds the aks2apa1tra etc.
<>in her left hand. She is seated on a swan. S4a1n3kari1
<>(Ma1hes4vari1) is white in colour. She has in her right
<>hand bow and arrows, and the disc and bow in her left
<>hand. The ox is her vehicle. Kauma1ri1 is seated on the
<>peacock. She has two hands in one of which is held
<>S4akti (Vel). Laks2mi1 has in her right hand the conch
<>and disc, and the club and the lotus flower in her left
<>hand. Va1ra1hi1 rides the buffalo with staff, sword, club
<>and conch in her hands. Indra1n2i1 is seated on the club,
<>holding diamond in her hands. She has a thousand
<>eyes. Ca1mun2d2i1 has three eyes and is without flesh in the
<>body. Her hairs are raised above. She holds in her left
<>hand elephant's skin and s4u1la in the right hand. At
<>times she is seated on a corpse also.
<NI>Now, about the idols of the eight Am3ba1s. Rudra Carc-
<>cika1 holds a skull, S4u1la and cord in her hands. She
<>wears elephant's skin, her legs slightly held up. She
<>becomes Rudraca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes eight hands,
<>and holds the skull and the d2amaru. And in dancing
<>pose she is called Nat2es4vari1, and with four faces Maha1l-
<>aks2mi1. She is called Siddhaca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes
<>the form with ten hands and three eyes, and when she
<>eats men, horses and buffaloes. In this form she holds
<>in her right hand the sword, d2amaru etc. and in her
<>left hand the Tris4u1la, bell etc. Since the Devi1 is sarva-
<>siddhiprada1yika1 (giver of all divine attainments or
<>assets) she is Siddhayoges4vari1 also. There is also an-
<>other Devi1 in this very form who holds the pa1s4a and
<>Am3kus4a in her hand and who is slightly red in colour.
<>She is called Bhairavi1. When Bhairavi1 assumes the
<>form with twelve hands she is called Ru1pavidya1. All the [Page219-a+ 64]
<>above eight Devi1s were born in burial grounds and are
<>Raudramu1rtis. They are known as the As2t2a1mba1s.
<HI>DEVI1BHA1GAVATA. The S4aivas venerate this book as
<>one of the eighteen Pura1n2as. But according to the Vai-
<>s2n2avites, this is an authoritative book of a loftier level
<>than the eighteen Pura1n2as. (See under Pura1n2a).
<HI>DEVIKA1 I. (VEDIKA1). Daughter of Gova1sa, the S4ai-
<>bya King. She was wedded by Yudhis2t2hira in Svayam3-
<>vara, and to them were born a son called Yaudheya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 76).
<HI>DEVIKA1 II. A holy centre. A dip in the ti1rtha there
<>will give the same result as that of a yajn5a. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 102).
<HI>DEVI1PI1T2HA. The dead body of Sati1devi1 crumbled into
<>small pieces and fell in different places in Bha1rata.
<>Each place where a piece of the dead body fell, is known
<>by the name Devi1pi1t2ha. There is a reason why the
<>dead body crumbled into pieces.
<NI>Daks2a performed a sacrifice to which S4iva was not invit-
<>ed and Sati1devi1 came to the sacrifice, and committed
<>suicide by jumping into the fire. S4iva who became furi-
<>ous, killed Daks2a and carrying the dead body of his
<>wife on his shoulder, walked the length and breadth of
<>Bha1rata like a mad man. It seemed that he was not
<>going to recover from this mania, and the devas (gods)
<>were worried at this. To rescue S4iva from this mental
<>disposition, Maha1vis2n2u, unseen by others, followed
<>S4iva with a bow and arrow. Whenever it was conve-
<>nient Maha1vis2n2u sent an arrow at the body of Sati1devi1,
<>on the shoulder of S4iva. By the hitting of the arrows
<>the body was crumbled into pieces and fell here and
<>there. Thus within a few days the body of Sati1devi1
<>came to an end and S4iva walked to Kaila1sa. The
<>pieces of the dead body fell in 108 places, and thus 108
<>Devi1pi1t2has came into existence. The names of the
<>places and the names by which the Devi1 is known in
<>such places are given below.

<HI>DEVI1STHA1NA. A holy place, dedicated to S4a1kam3bhari1
<>Devi1. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Vana Parva, Chapter
<>84, Stanza 13) that one who stays in this holy place
<>and eats greens (cira or kira) for three days will get
<>the fruits of eating greens for twelve years.
<HI>DEVI1TI1RTHA(M). The common name of three holy
<>centres (S4an3khini1, Madhuvat2i1, Mr2gadhu1ma1) in Kuruk-
<>s2etra. Those who bathe in S4ankhini1 will become beauti-
<>ful in appearance, while those who bathe in Madhu-
<>vat2i1 and Mr2gadhu1ma1 will get the benefits of perform-
<>ing a thousand goda1nas (gifts of cows).
<HI>DHA. This letter means dha1ran2a, S4obhana, Dha1ta1, dhat-
<>tu1ra (umma plant). (Chapter 348, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHA1MA1. A hermit who protected Gan3ga1-Maha1dva1ra.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 111, Stanza
<>17).
<HI>DHAMADHAMA. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>27, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAKA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHANAPA1LA. A Vais4ya who lived in the city of Ayo-
<>dhya1. He built in Ayodhya1 a temple for the Sun-god
<>and appointed, for a year, paying his wages in advance,
<>a scholar well versed in Pura1n2as to read aloud the
<>Pura1n2as in the temple. After six months Dhanapa1la
<>died and as a result of the goodness accrued to him by
<>his worthy deeds the Sun-god came to him with his
<>chariot and took him to his place and seating him on
<>his seat paid respects to him. Later he was taken to
<>Brahmaloka. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Brahma Ka1n2d2a,
<>Chapter 94).
<HI>DHANAS4ARMA1. A brahmin belonging to Madhyades4a.
<>Once when Dhanas4arma1 went to the forest to get
<>darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and gett-
<>ing frightened ran away from them. But the spirits
<>followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said
<>“Oh, please do not harm me. Maha1vis2n2u will bless
<>you.”
<NI>The moment they heard the name of Vis2n2u there came
<>a change in them. They reiterated their story to
<>Dhanas4arma1. Their names were Vais4a1kha, Suda1sa and
<>Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vais4a1kha he
<>got a nick-name ‘Kr2taghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All
<>the three were human beings in their previous birth.
<>Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivi1ra.
<>All the three became evil spirits because of their sins.
<NI>From the conversation Dhanas4arma1 understood that
<>Vais4a1kha was his father and they then knew each other. [Page220-b+ 64]
<>The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to
<>absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell.
<>Vais4a1kha then told him observe the vrata, Vais4a1kha-
<>pu1rn2ima1. He did that and all the spirits went to
<>heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAVARDHANA. A virtuous Vais4ya who lived in
<>the island of Pus2kara in the Kr2tayuga. Once Dhana-
<>vardhana after having performed Vais4vadeva sat for
<>his food. At that time he heard a cry from outside
<>“Annam3 dehi (give me food)”. Dhanavardhana imme-
<>diately came out to see who the visitor was but seeing
<>none went in and started taking his food. Because he
<>ate his food once left aside, his body was torn to
<>hundred pieces. (Bhavis2ya, Brahma Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANAVATI1. See Su1ryaprabha1.
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA I. A famous serpent. This serpent was
<>born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife Kadru1. (S4loka 5,
<>Chapter 35, A1di Parva). This serpent served as a rope to
<>bind the horses to the chariot of S4iva during the time
<>of burning to death the Tripuras. (S4loka 29, Chapter
<>34, Karn2a Parva). This serpent sits in the court of
<>Varun2a and worships him. (S4loka 9, Chapter 9,
<>Sabha1 parva).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA II. Another name for Arjuna. (See under
<>Arjuna).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA III. The army given to Subrahman2ya by
<>S4iva. (S4loka 17, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA IV. A Sanskrit critic who lived during
<>the period between 11th and 12th century A.D. He was
<>a member of the court of King Mun5ja. His important
<>work is ‘Das4aru1paka’. This work contains three
<>hundred s4lokas divided in four separate divisions. After
<>the death of Mun5ja, Dhanika, brother of Dhanan5jaya,
<>wrote a commentary on this work. The treatise is
<>named ‘Das4aru1pa1valoka’. There are several quotations in
<>this from the Sanskrit dramas ‘Ven2i1sam3ha1ra’ and ‘Ratna1-
<>vali1’. He has in this work discussed Drama and Poetry
<>in general giving prominence to the emotional side of it.
<>The critical work, Das4aru1pa1valoka, contains quotations
<>from a book ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ by Dhanika himself. But
<>the work ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ has not yet been made avail-
<>able. Even in composing poetry Dhanan5jaya was well
<>versed. He is the author of the well-known epic ‘Ra1ghava-
<>pa1n2d2avi1ya’. It is known as ‘Dvisandha1na Ka1vya’ also.
<>This is based on the lives of Pa1n2d2avas and S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<NI>Dhanan5jaya bears the name of S4rutaki1rti also. It is
<>stated by scholars that Ra1ghavapa1n2d2avi1ya was written
<>during the period 1123 to 1140 A.D. (History of classi-
<>cal Sanskrit Literature).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA V. There was once a brahmin ascetic
<>called Dhanan5jaya in the gotra of Vasis2t2ha. This hermit
<>had hundred wives and got hundred sons, one by each
<>of his wives. The son born of his wife S4a1bha1ka (S4ala1ka)
<>was named Karun2a. The father divided his assets
<>equally among his sons and yet they quarrelled with
<>each other.
<NI>Once Karun2amuni went to the shores of Bhava-
<>na1s4ini1 along with a few other munis to worship
<>Narasim3ha. There a brahmin had brought a lovely
<>lime as an offering to the deity. Karun2a took the lime
<>from him and smelt it. At this the brahmin got angry
<>and cursed him. “Sinner, may you live as a fly for a
<>hundred years. Then Maha1tma1 Dadhi1ca will give you
<>back your original form.” Karun2a instantly became a [Page221-a+ 65]
<>fly and he pleaded to his wife thus “Beloved, I have
<>become a fly. Please do protect me.” Karun2a started
<>flying hither and thither and his cruel brothers made
<>the fly fall in oil and killed it. S4ucismita1, wife of
<>Karun2a, started weeping laying the dead fly in her lap.
<>Arundhati1devi1 passing that way saw her and consoled
<>her thus: ‘S4ucismita1, stop lamenting. I shall bring it
<>to life this instant by sacred ashes.’ So saying the Devi1
<>took some ashes from the fire-pit and reciting the
<>powerful Mr2tyun5jaya mantra sprinkled it on the dead
<>body of the fly. S4ucismita1 fanned the fly. The potency
<>of the ashes brought the fly back to life.
<NI>After a hundred years one of his relatives killed it
<>again. S4ucismita1 grief-stricken, took the dead fly to the
<>Mahars2i, Dadhi1ca. The sage told her thus: “It was
<>bhasma (sacred ashes) that gave life three times to
<>Jamadagni, Kas4yapa, the devas and myself. I will,
<>therefore, give life to thy husband by bhasma itself.”
<>Dadhi1ca took some ashes and meditating on Mahes4vara
<>recited a mantra and sprinkled it on the dead fly and
<>brought it back to life. By the touch of Dadhi1ca, the
<>fly, husband of S4ucismita1, became Karun2a again and
<>both of them went back to their hermitage. (Chapter
<>101, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA VI. A brahmin devotee of Maha1vis2n2u
<>who lived in the Treta1 yuga. Once, in winter, when
<>for want of proper clothing he could bear the biting
<>cold no longer, he broke some twigs of the As4vattha
<>tree (poplar leafed fig tree) and made fire to warm
<>him. When Dhanan5jaya broke the twigs it gave reflec-
<>tive pain on the body of Maha1vis2n2u. But Maha1vis2n2u
<>who was aware of the unflinching devotion of Dhanan5-
<>jaya to himself was not displeased but appeared before
<>Dhanan5jaya with wounds all over the body. The
<>Brahmin enquired how Vis2n2u got the wounds and on
<>knowing that it was the consequence of his breaking the
<>twigs of As4vattha Dhanan5jaya in utter grief started to
<>cut his own head off. Greatly pleased Vis2n2u stopped
<>him from his attempt and asked him to name a boon.
<>Very modestly he replied that he would be satisfied if
<>he was given the strength to continue as a devotee of
<>Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANES4VARA. A Brahmin born in the city of Avanti.
<>Abandoning the duties enjoined by scriptures to a
<>Brahmin he strayed away from the Brahmin fold doing
<>all sorts of sins. He became a store-house of sins. He
<>was engaged in commerce and once while travelling he
<>reached the city of Ma1his2mati1. There he met many people
<>from several adjoining villages who had come there to ob-
<>serve the Ka1rttika Vrata. Later Dhanes4vara was bitten by
<>a cobra there and fell down fainting. Very soon he died.
<NI>When he died the messengers of Yama came
<>and took him bound to Ka1lapuri1. There, Citra-
<>gupta read out to Yama all the sins Dhanes4vara had
<>committed from boyhood till his death. Citragupta
<>added “Even from boyhood there is no record of any
<>good deed done by him. On the other hand the sins he
<>has committed could not be told in a year. He is an
<>incarnation of evil. He must be roasted in hell till the
<>end of the world.” On hearing this the body of Yama
<>blazed like flame with anger and calling aside an atten-
<>dant he ordered, “Hi, Pretapa1laka, take this sinner
<>away, beat him with spiked clubs and throw him into
<>Kumbhi1pa1ka”. Pretapa1laka instantly took him away
<>and breaking his head with a thorn-spiked club threw [Page221-b+ 64]
<>him into a copper vessel containing burning oil. But to
<>his great amazement the burning oil became cold as
<>soon as the body of Dhanes4vara came into contact with
<>it just as it happened once before in the case of Prahla1da.
<>The perplexed attendant ran to Yama and told him of
<>this strange incident. Yama was also surprised at this
<>novelty in hell and called back Dhanes4vara and started
<>enquiring about his life once again. Na1rada came there
<>at that time. Both of them then talked about Dhanes4vara.
<>Na1rada told Yama how the unanticipated thing so
<>happened because Dhanes4vara on the eve of his death
<>spent some time with people who were observing the
<>Ka1rttika Vrata washing away thus all the sins accumu-
<>lated so far in his life. Hearing that Yama took Dhanes4-
<>vara round hell and giving Dhanes4vara, the position of
<>a Yaks2a sent him to Kuberapuri1. (Chapter 115, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANI. A messenger of the asuras called Kapas. The
<>Kapas once sent Dhani to preach moral code among the
<>Brahmins. (Chapter 157, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.)
<HI>DHANIKA. A Sanskrit poet. (See Dhanan5jaya IV).
<HI>DHANUGR2HA. (DHANUGRAHA, DHANURDHARA)
<>One of the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed
<>in the great battle by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 62, Chapter 84,
<>Karn2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANUVAKTRA. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>62, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANURVEDA.
<NI>{%General information.%} A scientific treatise on the art of
<>warfare in ancient Bha1rata. Because of the undue im-
<>portance of the science the treatise is deemed and respect-
<>ed as a Veda. There have been innumerable books on the
<>subject to teach Dhanurveda to the Ks2atriya youths.
<>In the book ‘Prastha1nabheda’ by Madhusu1dana Saras-
<>vati1 he states that Dhanurveda is a branch of Yajurveda.
<>A Sanskrit book called Dhanurvedasam3hita1 is now
<>available. Some scholars are of opinion that not much
<>antiquity can be attributed to this work. Many books
<>relating to Dhanurveda have been lost to us. What
<>details are there in Agni Pura1n2a are given below:
<NI>2) {%Divisions of Dhanurveda.%} This is known as Catus2pa1da
<>(four-footed) also because of the fact that the four
<>main constituents of an army are the chariots, elephants,
<>horses and men. Dhanurveda has been divided into
<>five parts (1) Yantramukta, (2) Pa1n2imukta, (3) Mukta-
<>sandha1rita, (4) Amukta and (5) Ba1huyuddha. There is
<>another division according to Astra and S4astra. There
<>is yet another division of the science into two by some
<>scholars from a different viewpoint calling them Ma1ya1
<>and R2ju.
<NI>{%Yantramukta%} (Yantra = machine). This means a war-
<>fare where machines are used. Ks2epin2i1 (sling) bow and
<>arrow and other such machines are included in this.
<NI>{%Pa1n2imukta.%} (Pa1n2i = hand). This is where the hand is used
<>mainly. Stone, mace etc. are used in this.
<NI>{%Muktasandha1rita.%} This includes the use of weapons like
<>a spear.
<NI>{%Amukta.%} The use of a weapon like a sword which never
<>leaves your hand.
<NI>{%Ba1huyuddha.%} (Ba1hu = head). The fight with only bare
<>hands without the use of a weapon. One who wishes
<>to fight should make ready his own weapons. He should
<>be one who will never get tired even after exertion. A
<>war with bows and arrows is considered the best and [Page222-a+ 65]
<>most manly, that with a spear ranks next, a fight with a
<>sword is bad and a fight with hands, the most mean.
<NI>3) {%The Trainees.%} Only a brahmin is entitled to be a pre-
<>ceptor in Dhanurveda. The Ks2atriya and Vais4ya should
<>learn from him. The S4u1dra can fight of his own in
<>danger. He is not allowed to learn military science
<>from a preceptor. Those mixed-born are to help the
<>king during a war.
<NI>4) {%Various postures.%} There are nine different ways of
<>standing when you give a fight, classified according to
<>the different positions of one's foot, heel and knee.
<NI>{%Samapa1da.%} When you stand with your An3gus2t2ha, Nari-
<>ya1n2i (Gulpha), Pa1n2i and Pa1da closely joined together,
<>it is termed Samapa1da.
<NI>{%Vais4a1kha.%} Keep your legs twentyseven inches apart and
<>without bending your knees stand erect throwing your
<>weight on the fingers of the foot. This stand is called
<>Vais4a1kha.
<NI>{%Man2d2ala.%} Keep your knees thirtysix inches apart and
<>stand in the shape of a ham3sapan3kti and this position
<>is called Man2d2ala.
<NI>{%A1li1d2ha.%} Bend your right knee and thigh in the shape of a
<>plough and without any movement to that posture
<>draw your left leg fortyfive inches apart. This stand is
<>called A1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Pratya1li1d2ha.%} If you bend your left knee and thigh and
<>stand like above it is called Pratya1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Ja1ta.%} Place your right foot straight and place the left one
<>perpendicular to the right one with the heels and the
<>ankles of the feet five fingers apart. The whole length
<>of the posture should not exceed twelve fingers. This
<>stand is called Ja1ta.
<NI>{%Dan2d2aya1ta.%} Keep the right knee bent and the left leg
<>straight or vice versa. This posture is called Dan2d2a1yata.
<NI>{%Vikat2a.%} If for the above posture the distance between
<>the two legs is two palm-length it is Vikat2a.
<NI>{%Svaput2a.%} Keep the knees vigun2as and the feet Utta1yanas
<>for the posture of Svaput2a.
<NI>{%S4vastika.%} Keep your legs sixteen fingers apart and raise
<>your feet a little keeping the level of both the feet equal.
<>This is Svastika.
<NI>5) {%Use of arrows.%} Before a man is to make use of a bow
<>and arrow he should first take the posture of Svastika
<>and bow down. He should take the bow by the left hand,
<>take the arrow by the right hand. He then should adopt
<>a posture of either Vais4a1kha or Ja1ta and taking the bow
<>should sink into the earth one end of the bow and
<>draw the bow-string up to the other end and see whe-
<>ther there is sufficient length for the string. He should
<>take an arrow from his sheath and thrust the arrow-
<>head into the ground near the bow. He should
<>place his elbow on the top of the arrow with his forearm
<>bent and fist clenched. If the clenched fist touches the
<>top of the bow that bow and arrow is superior to any
<>other. He should tie the bow-string in a way that the
<>distance between the tied bow-string and the bow is
<>twelve fingers. He should place the bow in front of his
<>navel and the arrows in a quiver on his hip. Taking an
<>arrow he should raise the bow and fix the arrow at a
<>point on the bow-tring between his eye and ear. He
<>should take the arrow by his left fist and fix it so that the
<>fist touches the left nipple. The bow should not change
<>position horizontally, vertically, laterally, face down-
<>wards or upwards. Then taking an arrow from the sheath
<>by the thumb and forefinger fix it on the bow-string and [Page222-b+ 65]
<>stretch it well before sending the shot. The clue to
<>correct aim is this. Anything that one can see with one's
<>eyes but can be covered by his fist is within the arrow-
<>shot. When one arrow is sent another should be taken
<>immediately from the sheath and sent in quick succes-
<>sion. This is called Upaccheda.
<NI>6) {%Operations with a sword and a carma (shield).%} There
<>are thirtytwo different ways of putting into use a sword
<>or a ‘carma’ (shield). Bhra1nta, Udbhra1nta, A1viddha,

<>M.B.).
<HI>DHANVA. One of the Kings of Ka1s4i. Dhanvantari was
<>born as his son. (For details see under Dhanvantari).
<HI>DHANVANTARI I. A deva who was a preceptor in
<>A1yurveda.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} The devas and asuras together churned the
<>milky ocean, Ks2i1ra1bdhi, to salvage Amr2ta (Nectar) from
<>it. After thousand years there arose from the ocean a
<>deva with a Kaman2d2alu (water-pot of ascetics) in one
<>hand and a dan2d2a in the other. That deva was Dhan-
<>vantari, (S4loka 31, Sarga 45, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>The birth of Dhanvantari from the ocean of Milk is
<>described in Chapter 29 of Harivam3s4a thus:
<NI>Prosperous-looking Dhanvantari rising above the water-
<>level of Ks2i1ra1bdhi stood worshipping Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u
<>gave him the name of Abja. Dhanvantari is thus known
<>by the name of Abja also. Dhanvantari bowing to
<>Vis2n2u said “Prabho, I am your son. Allot to me
<>yajn5abha1ga”.
<NI>Vts2n2u replied thus: “Portions of yajn5a have already
<>been allotted. Because you were born after the devas
<>you cannot be considered as one among them. You will
<>be born again in the world for a second time and then you
<>will be a celebrity. In your second life even from while
<>in the womb you will have knowledge of An2ima1 and
<>Garima1. Therefore you will be born as a deva incar-
<>nate. You will write in eight divisions a book on
<>A1yurveda; your second life will be in Dva1para yuga.”
<>After having said so much Vis2n2u disappeared.
<NI>2) {%Rebirth of Dhanvantari.%} Suhotra, King of Ka1s4i, in
<>the second Dva1para yuga had two sons, S4ala and Gr2tsa-
<>mada. S4unaka was the son of Gr2tsamada. S4ala got a son,
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a. Ka1s4a was born to A1rs2t2is2en2a. To Ka1s4a was
<>born Di1rghatapas (Dhanva1). For a long time Dhanva1
<>did not have any children and so he went and did
<>penance to propitiate Abjadeva. Abjadeva (Dhanvan-
<>tari) was pleased and was born as a son to Dhanva1.
<>Dhanva1 named the boy as Dhanvantari and the latter
<>taught his disciples A1yurveda, by parts, eight in num-
<>ber. From Dhanvantari in order were born Ketuma1n--
<>Bhi1maratha--Divoda1sa. (Chapter 29, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>3) {%Dhanvantari and Pariks2it.%} There is a story in the
<>pura1n2as that when Taks2aka went and bit Pari1ks2it to
<>kill him, a Vis2aha1ri (one who cures those infected with
<>snake venom) rushed to save the king but was bribed
<>and sent back by Taks2aka. There are indications in
<>the Pura1n2as to show that the Vis2aha1ri under reference
<>was Dhanvantari though it is stated that Kas4yapa was
<>the person involved. (See under Taks2aka).
<NI>4) {%Dhanvantari and Manasa1devi1.%} In the Kr2s2n2ajanma [Page223-b+ 65]
<>Khan2d2a of Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a there is a story
<>connecting Dhanvantari with Manasa1devi1, a serpent-
<>goddess.
<NI>Once Dhanvantari with his disciples was going to Kaila1sa.
<>On the way Taks2aka made a venom-spitting hiss. At
<>once one of the disciples of Dhanvantari boldly went
<>and plucked the diamond on the head of Taks2aka and
<>threw it to the ground. Hearing this Va1suki, King of
<>serpents, sent to Dhanvantari thousands of serpents
<>under the leadership of Dron2a, Pun2d2ari1ka and Dhanan5-
<>jaya. The poisonous breath of all these serpents joined
<>together made the disciples of Dhanvantari swoon.
<>Immediately Dhanvantari by a medicine made from
<>vanaspati made all his disciples recover and then sent
<>all the serpents to a swoon. When Va1suki heard this
<>he sent the serpent-maid, Manasa1devi1, a disciple of
<>S4iva, to face Dhanvantari. Manasa1devi1 and Gad2u1ra
<>were both disciples of S4iva. But Dhanvantari was a
<>follower of Gad2u1ra. Manasa1devi1 made all the disciples
<>of Dhanvantari swoon but the latter because of his great
<>proficiency is Vis2avidya1 soon brought back his disciples
<>to normal. When Manasa1devi1 found that it was impos-
<>sible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples by using
<>poison Manasa1devi1 took the tris4u1la given to her by S4iva
<>and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this S4iva and
<>Brahma1 appeared before them and pacifying them sent
<>them all their way.
<HI>DHANVANTARI II. (Amr2ta1ca1rya). An eminent medi-
<>cal scientist born in the ambas2t2ha caste. There is no
<>reference anywhere in the Pura1n2as regarding any
<>relationship between the two Dhanvantaris. There is
<>the following story about Amr2ta1ca1rya in Ambas2t2ha1ca1ra-
<>candrika1.
<NI>Once Ga1lava Mahars2i went to the forest to collect
<>darbha and firewood. He walked for long and felt
<>thristy and hungry. Then he saw a girl coming that
<>way with water and Ga1lava quenched his thirst taking
<>water from her. Pleased with her the Mahars2i blessed
<>her saying “May you get a good son.” The girl replied
<>that she was still unmarried. Ga1lava then made a figure
<>of a male with darbha and told her to get a child from
<>that figure. She was a Vais4ya girl named Vi1rabhadra1
<>and she got a beautiful child of that darbha male.
<>Because the boy was born to a Vais4ya of a brahmin
<>male he belonged to the Ambas2t2ha caste. The boy was
<>named Amr2ta1ca1rya.
<HI>DHANYAMA1LA1. The foster-mother of Atika1ya. (See

<>of the ways of union with the supreme Spirit). Yama,
<>Niyama, A1sana, Pra1n2a1ya1ma, Pratya1ha1ra, Dha1ran2a1,
<>Dhya1na and Sama1dhi are the eight means (See under
<>Ra1jayoga).
<HI>DHA1RAN2A I. A king born in the family of Candra-

<HI>DHA1RAN2A II. A na1ga (serpent) of the family of [Page224-a+ 65]
<>Kas4yapa. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Stanza
<>16).
<HI>DHARAN2A(M). A measure. In ancient times a dharan2a
<>was made up of ten palas. (Manusmr2ti).
<HI>DHARA1PA1LA. A king of ancient times. He ruled over
<>a country named Vidis4a1. There is a holy place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet. Dhara1pa1la cons-
<>tructed a temple at the confluence. There is a story also
<>for his doing so.
<NI>Once a S4iva-pa1rs2ada brought to S4iva a woman at a time
<>when Pa1rvati1 was away from the place. S4iva and the
<>woman were enjoying each other when Pa1rvati1 came
<>to the place. Getting angry she cursed the Pa1rs2ada and
<>made him into a fox. The fox came to the place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet and did penance
<>there and attained Moks2a. Dhara1pa1la saw the divine
<>plane coming down to take the Pa1rs2ada away and he,
<>therefore, constructed a temple at the place where the
<>plane landed. He then arranged scholars well versed
<>in Vedas and s4a1stras to read Padma Pura1n2a there. He
<>himself read Padma Pura1n2a and attained moks2a.
<>(Chapter 29, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHA1RES4VARI1. A goddess living in the ti1rtha (holy
<>bath) of Jambunada. This goddess is another form of
<>Pa1rvati1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>DHA1RIN2I1. A daughter born to the Manes (Pitr2s) crea-
<>ted by Brahma1, by their wife Svadha1. Dha1rin2i1 had an

<NI>2) {%Marriage and family life.%} The Bha1gavata states that
<>Dharma married the thirteen daughters of Daksapraja1-
<>pati named S4raddha1, Maitri1, Daya1, S4a1nti, Pus2t2i, Tus2t2i,
<>Kriya1, Unnati, Buddhi, Medha1, Titiks2a1, Hr2i1 and Mu1rti.
<>Besides them he married ten other girls named Bha1nu,
<>Lamba1, Kukubh, Ja1mi, Vis4va1, Sa1dhya1, Marutvati1,

<>the following daughters of Daks2a: Ki1rti, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti,
<>Medha1, Pus2t2i, S4raddha1, Kriya1, Buddhi and Lajja1.
<NI>From each of his wives there originated a family. The

<>Moda; Unnati--Darpa; Buddhi--Artha; Medha1--
<>Sukr2ti; Titiks2a1--S4ama; Hri1--Pras4raya. Mu1rti gave
<>birth to the virtuous Narana1ra1yan2as. Sunr2ta1 became the
<>mother of the devas, Satyavrata and Satyasena.
<>Satyasena became famous by slaying many cruel and
<>evil-natured Yaks2as, demons and spirits. Lamba1 gave
<>birth to R2s2abha and Vidyotana. R2s2abha got a son,
<>Indrasena. Vidyotana became the father of stanayitnu.
<>Kukubh delivered San3kat2a and San3kat2a became the
<>father of Ki1kat2a and Durgadeva. Ja1mi got a son Svarga
<>and of him was born Nandi1. Vis4va1 gave birth to Vis4va- [Page224-b+ 60]
<>devas and Sa1dhya1 to Sa1dhyas. These Sa1dhyas are different
<>from those born of Brahma1. Sa1dhyas became the father of
<>Arthasiddhi. Marutvati1 gave birth to Marutvat and
<>Jayanta. Vasu gave birth to eight sons and they were
<>known as As2t2avasus. Dron2a, the first of the As2t2avasus,
<>married Abhimati. Abhimati is known as Dhara1 also.
<>It was Dron2a and Dhara1 who were born as Nandagopa
<>and Yas4oda1 later. Pra1n2a, second of the As2t2avasus,
<>married U1rjasvati1, daughter of Priyavrata. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Prominent sons.%} Four sons of Dharma, Hari, Kr2s2n2a,

<>great ascetics. (See under Narana1ra1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%The daughter named Dharmavrata1.%} Dharmadeva got a
<>daughter named Dharmavrata1 of his wife Dharmavati1.
<>Dharmavrata1 was an ascetic and she was married to
<>Mari1ci, son of Brahma1. One day Mari1ci came back
<>from the forest after getting darbha and flowers extre-
<>mely tired and so after food lay down to rest. His wife
<>sitting by his side massaged his legs. The sage fell as-
<>leep. Then Brahma1 came there and Dharmavrata1
<>attended on him and worshipped him. Mari1ci, when he
<>woke up, finding Dharmavrata1 attending on another
<>man cursed her and made her into stone. Dharmavrata1
<>pleaded not guilty and standing inside a fire-pit did pen-
<>ance for ten thousand years. Brahma1 and other devas
<>appeared before her and consoled her by assuring that
<>though she would be a stone devas would take their
<>abode in it and that she would be worshipped by all.
<>From that day onwards that stone was known as Devas4ila1
<>and even now it is believed that Brahma1 and other
<>devas live therein. (Chapter 114, Agni Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Dharma was cursed and made Vidura by An2ima1n2d2avya.%} (See

<>Brahmin and carried away by its horns the Aran2i stick
<>which the Brahmin owned for making fire by attrition.

<NI>(6) Dharma appeared in the form of a Yaks2a and made
<>all the Pa1n2d2avas swoon except Yudhis2t2hira, on the
<>shores of a pond in the forest and later got them back
<>to normal. (See under Dharmaputra).
<NI>(7) Dharmadeva went to Vis4va1mitra in the guise of
<>Vasis2t2ha to test him. (See para 3 of Ga1lava).
<NI>(8) Following a directive from Brahma1, Dharmadeva
<>once brought before Varun2a all the daityada1navas bound
<>by ropes. (Chapter 128, Udyoga Parva).
<NI>(9) Maha1vis2n2u was born as a son of Dharmadeva. (See
<>under Narana1ra1yan2a). [Page225-a+ 65]
<NI>(10) Dharma worshipped a brahmin named Satya tak-
<>ing the form of a deer. (S4loka 17, Chapter 272, S4a1nti
<>Parva).
<NI>(11) Dharma tested Sudars4ana taking the form of a
<>brahmin. (S4loka 79, Chapter 2, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(12) Dharma saved a sage named Vatsana1bha from a
<>great downpour taking the shape of a buffalo. (Chapter
<>12, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(13) Dharma disguised as a brahmin, went and impart-
<>ed advice to Janaka, father of Si1ta1. (Chapter 32, As4va-
<>medha Parva).
<NI>(14) To test Jamadagni, Dharma went to his a1s4rama
<>taking the form of Anger. Jamadagni had just milked
<>Ka1madhenu and kept the milk in a pot. Dharma as
<>Anger crept into the milk. Jamadagni drank it and yet
<>remained calm. Seeing this Dharma appeared before
<>him in the form of a Brahmin and blessed him assuring
<>Jamadagni that in future he would be obedient to
<>Dharma (Chapter 91, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(15) When at the fag end of their life the Pa1n2d2avas
<>started on their Maha1prastha1na, Dharma as a dog
<>accompanied them up to the gates of heaven. (S4loka
<>22, Chapter 5, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).
<NI>7) {%Dharma and Ka1la.%} There is a misunderstanding found
<>even in some Pura1n2as that Ka1la, the chief of Ka1lapuri1,
<>and Dharma are one and the same person. But if the
<>stories around each are examined it is easy to deduce
<>that they are two different devas. The father and
<>mother of Dharmadeva is Brahma1. The father of Ka1la
<>is Su1rya and mother Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1.
<>This itself is a sufficient evidence to show that the two
<>are different persons. Further, Ka1la or Yama is the
<>sixth descendant of Vis2n2u.
<NI>But scholars are misled to think that the two are iden-
<>tical. There is a reason for it.

<NI>The above are the synonyms of Ka1la. Vya1sa has used as
<>synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Maha1bha1rata the
<>words Dharmara1ja, Vr2s2a and Yama. Now among the
<>synonyms for the two there are two words in common--
<>Dharmara1ja and Yama. This has led to this misunder-
<>standing. Because Ka1la weighs the evil and good in
<>man he got the name Dharmara1ja. Dharmadeva got
<>that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma.
<>The real name of Ka1la is Yama. Dharmadeva got the
<>name Yama because he possesses ‘Yama’ (control of
<>the self for moral conduct). Ka1la has no sons; Vidura
<>and Yudhis2t2hira are the sons of Dharmadeva.
<HI>DHARMABHR2T. A mahars2i who was an inhabitant of
<>Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. This sage narrated to S4ri1 Ra1ma the
<>story of the pond ‘Pan5ca1psara’ and the ga1nadha1ra1 that
<>rises from it. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya, Sarga 11).
<HI>DHARMABUDDHI. See under Mitrabheda.
<HI>DHARMADA. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 72,
<>Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHARMADATTA I. A king of Kosala. He had a wife
<>named Na1gas4ri1. By her chastity she became a celebrity
<>and got the name of Arundhati1 of the earth. They got
<>a daughter named Ta1ra1datta1. Once when Dharmadatta
<>and Na1gas4ri1 were engaged in conversation both remem- [Page225-b+ 64]
<>bered their lives in their previous births. It was not
<>allowed to speak about previous births in open and if
<>anybody did so death was the penalty. But Na1gas4ri1
<>could not control herself and prepared to accept the
<>worst. Na1gas4ri1 told her husband thus: “I am just remin-
<>ded of my life in my previous birth. I will tell you my
<>story. I was the servant maid of a brahmin named
<>Ma1dhava in this same place. I had a husband named
<>Devada1sa then. My husband was the son of a merchant.
<>We made a small house of our own and lived there
<>peacefully. Each of us would bring food from where we
<>worked and everyday we used to set apart a portion of
<>what we got for guests and the pitr2s. We were satisfied
<>with what was left after that. If we got more than one
<>set of clothes we would give it to the poor. Then there
<>came a famine in the country. Our earning also was
<>reduced daily. We lived in hunger. One day a hungry
<>and tired sannya1si1 came to our place and we gave him
<>the whole of our food. My husband died that
<>day and I gave away my life jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of my husband. Then I was born in the family of
<>a King and became your wife.”
<NI>Dharmadatta also got back the memory of his previous
<>birth. He said he was the Devada1sa of Na1gas4ri1's
<>previous life.
<NI>The moment they finished talking about their previous
<>births both fell down dead. Orphaned Ta1ra1datta1 then
<>lived under the care of her mother's younger sister.
<>After some time a Mahars2i came to their house and by
<>his blessing Ta1ra1datta1 got a husband named Kalin3ga-
<>sena. Kalin3gasena was a brave and daring Prince. Very
<>soon they got a daughter and she was named Kalin3ga-
<>sena1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5juka1 lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 2).
<HI>DHARMADATTA II. A Brahmin who lived in the city
<>of Karavi1ra. One day while Dharmadatta was going to
<>the temple with material for pu1ja1 he came across a
<>demoness named Kalaha1 on the way. The brahmin
<>threw the pu1ja1 materials in his hand on to the face of
<>the demoness. When a tulasi1 leaf touched the demoness
<>she got back the memory of her previous birth.
<NI>Kalaha1 then abandoned her cruel nature and begged
<>Dharmadatta to advise her as to how she should get a
<>release from her demonaic life. Taking pity on her
<>Dharmadatta gave her all the ‘pun2ya’ he had obtained
<>by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Chapters 106, 107, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a and Chapters 2, 4, 24, 25
<>Skanda Pura1n2a).
<NI>Dharmadatta and Kalaha1 were born as Das4aratha and
<>Kaikeyi1 in their next births as a result of the accumulat-
<>ed Pun2ya obtained by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Sa1ra

<HI>DHARMAGUPTA I. A prince who obtained blessings
<>from S4iva by observing the Prados2avrata. (For detailed
<>story see Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DHARMAGUPTA II. A Nandara1jakuma1ra belonging to
<>the Lunar dynasty. Chapters 1, 2 and 13 of Skanda
<>Pura1n2a gives the following story about him.
<NI>Once Dharmagupta went to the forests, hunting. Deeply
<>interested in the game he never knew when it became
<>dusk. It was late to go back to the palace and so decid-
<>ing to stay in the forest for the night he climbed upon a
<>tree and made a seat there to rest. After some time a bear [Page226-a+ 64]
<>followed by a lion came running and took refuge on the
<>top of the same tree. The lion stood growling below.
<>Seeing a man on the same tree the bear said “Oh, Prince,
<>we are both in the same sad plight now. Believe me
<>as a friend. We can spend the night on this tree safe.
<>Therefore, go to sleep till midnight and I will keep
<>watch over. After that I will go to sleep and you keep
<>watch”. Gladly accepting the proposal the prince went
<>to sleep and the bear kept vigil. Then the lion suggested
<>to the bear to push down the prince. The bear replied
<>that he would never cheat a friend and that it was a
<>great sin also to do so. After midnight the bear slept
<>and the prince kept watchover. The lion then suggest-
<>ed to the prince to push down the bear. Thinking that
<>he would be saved if the bear is given to the lion the
<>unfaithful prince pushed the bear down. But the bear
<>escaped catching hold of the branches lower down.
<>Embittered at this the bear cursed Dharmagupta and
<>made him mad.
<NI>Then addressing Dharmagupta first and the lion next
<>the bear said thus: “I am Dhya1naka1s2t2ha a sage of the
<>Bhr2gu family. I can take any form I like. I cursed you,
<>Dharmagupta, because you cheated a friend. This lion
<>is Bhadra, one of the ministers of Kubera. Once he
<>entered into sexual act with a bear in front of the
<>a1s4rama of Gautama at midday and the sage cursed him
<>and made him into a lion. The sage as a relief from the
<>curse had further decreed that he would get his origi-
<>nal form when he entered into a conversation with me.”
<>When Dhya1naka1{??}ha finished speaking the lion changed
<>itself into the form of Bhadra.
<NI>Dharmagupta remained mad and his father, the King,
<>approached Jaimini for help. The sage said that the
<>prince would be cured of his madness if he bathed in the
<>Pus2karin2i1 ti1rtha. The king did as was suggested and
<>Dharmagupta was cured.
<HI>DHARMA1KARA. A righteous house-holder. Once a
<>prince entrusted his beautiful wife with Dharma1kara
<>and went away. Though she lived with him for six
<>months he did not have any kind of contact with her.
<>The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse
<>doubts about the chastity of his wife and the house-
<>holder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharma1-
<>kara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victo-
<>rious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but
<>also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed
<>him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i khan2d2a, Chapter 50).
<HI>DHARMAKETU. A king of Bha1rgava gotra. He was the
<>son of Suketu and father of Satyaketu. (Navama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMANANDANA. A king of the family of Bha1rgava.
<>(Navama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMA1N3GADA. A Brahmin who became a deep
<>meditator on Vis2n2u, because of his habits in his previous
<>life. Dharma1n3gada was the son of Rukma1n3gada by

<>a man of good personality, who lived with his

<>give his head to Mohini1 for the pleasure of his father.
<>God Vis2n2u was pleased with him because of his love of
<>his father and of his loyalty to Vais2n2avite deity and took
<>him bodily to heaven (Vaikun2t2ha). Dharma1n3gada [Page226-b+ 64]
<>lived there for many thousands of years enjoying heaven-
<>ly pleasures. Then he went astray from divine life
<>and had to take life again as Suvrata the son of a
<>Brahmin named Somas4arma1.
<NI>The wise Suvrata discarded the passions of Ka1ma (desire),
<>Krodha (anger) etc. and controlled his senses and engag-
<>ed himself in penance in Vaid2u1ryamaha1dri. For hun-
<>dred years he sat in meditation and Maha1vis2n2u was
<>pleased with him and took him and his father to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. At the instruction of Maha1vis2n2u, Suvrata
<>took life again in the house of Kas4yapa. When he died
<>he went to Vaikun2t2ha. In every successive birth he had
<>the remembrance of his previous birth. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 21).

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Arjuna.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Pa1n2d2u, brother of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, had two wives,
<>Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. There was a curse for Pa1n2d2u that he
<>would die the moment he touched his wife. (See under
<>Pa1n2d2u). Kunti1, the first wife of Pa1n2d2u, had obtained
<>from Durva1sas five mantras. The mantras were very po-
<>tent. If she called upon any god reciting the mantra that
<>God would manifest himself to her and bless her with a
<>son. When Kunti1 found that Ga1ndha1ri1 was pregnant and
<>was about to deliver she became anxious and meditating
<>on Dharmadeva recited one of the mantras given by Dur-
<>va1sas and got a child from him. The boy was born at mid-
<>day on the eighth Jyes2t2ha day of the year on Pan5cami1
<>and at the auspicious hour, Abhijit. At the time
<>of his birth there was a celestial voice which said “This
<>boy will become a very righteous and bold King, best
<>among the virtuous. He will be known as Yudhis2t2hira”.
<>Obeying the dictate of the mysterious voice he was
<>named Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 123).
<NI>3) {%Boyhood.%} When he had five sons Pa1n2d2u went to the forest
<>of S4atas4r2n3ga together with his family to spend the spring
<>time there. The sages residing in that forest conducted
<>the christening ceremony of Dharmaputra. Kas4yapa,
<>priest of Va1sudeva, performed the Upanayana ceremony
<>(thread-wearing) of Dharmaputra (Chapter 123, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tyapa1t2ha) A1di Parva, M.B.). Ra1jars2i S4uka imparted
<>instructions to Dharmaputra on spear-warfare. Pa1n2d2u
<>died during their stay there. Ma1dri1 abandoned her life
<>by jumping into her husband's funeral pyre. Before
<>doing so she called Dharmaputra to her side and join-
<>ing her hands together said “Son, you are now the father
<>to your brothers.” When Pa1n2d2u and Ma1dri1 were dead
<>the sages of the forest took Kunti1 and the children to
<>Hastina1pura and entrusted them to the care of Bhi1s2ma [Page227-a+ 65]
<>detailing to him all that had happened in the forest.
<>(Chapter 125, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Kauma1ra (youth).%} Dharmaputra and his brothers spent
<>their boyhood in Hastina1pura along with Duryodhana
<>and his brothers. Bhi1masena became a great foe of
<>Duryodhana and his brothers and Duryodhana always
<>nurtured a desire to kill Bhi1masena. Once Duryodhana
<>invited Dharmaputra and his brothers to have aquatic
<>games in the Gan3ga1. Accepting the invitation Dharma-
<>putra participated in the games along with his brothers.
<>One night Duryodhana caught hold of Bhi1ma alone and
<>tied him with ropes and threw him into the river. When in
<>the morning Dharmaputra found his brother missing he
<>ran to his mother to inform her of the loss. Kunti1 asked
<>him to start a search and while he was on it Bhi1masena
<>appeared before him and told him how he was thrown
<>into the river by Duryodhana and how he went to
<>Na1galoka and was brought to earth with great acquisi-
<>tions from there. Dharmaputra advised them not to
<>make the incident public. They received training in
<>warfare in Hastina1pura under Dron2a1ca1rya. Dharmaputra
<>got great proficiency in chariot-fighting. As Gurudaks2in2a1
<>(fee for the preceptor) Dharmaputra agreed to bring
<>Drupada bound before the preceptor. But Arjuna stop-
<>ped him and himself undertook the task (Chapters 127
<>to 136, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Becomes heir-apparent and goes to the forest.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>crowned Dharmaputra as the heir-apparent when the
<>latter had successfully completed his course of study in
<>warfare. By his good conduct, righteousness and adminis-
<>trative efficiency Dharmaputra excelled his father and be-
<>came very popular among his subjects. Jealous of this
<>Duryodhana decided to destroy the Pa1n2d2avas somehow.
<>With the permission of his father, Duryodhana cons-
<>tructed a palace at Va1ran2a1vata for the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>reside there. That palace was built of La1ks2a1 (See
<>under Arakkillam). The entire population resented
<>this act of Duryodhana and rebuked him. They tried
<>to follow Dharmaputra to Va1ran2a1vata and stay there.
<>But by tactful words he made them abandon that idea.
<>Still many brahmins followed Dharmaputra. After some
<>days Duryodhana set fire to the palace. But the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas escaped through a tunnel from the house which had
<>been constructed without the knowledge of Duryodhana
<>just at the time of construction of the building. Escap-
<>ing from there the Pa1n2d2avas reached the forests and
<>travelling farther came to the shore of the Gan3ga1.
<>(S4lokas 138 to 148, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<NI>(1) When the palace was burnt to ashes it was presumed
<>that they were dead and by the instructions of Dhr2tara1-
<>s2t2ra the funeral rites of the Pa1n2d2avas were conducted
<>at Hastina1pura. But Vidura informed Bhi1s2ma that the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were alive. (Chapter 149, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha,

<>prastha, his capital. (Chapter 206, A1di Parva).
<NI>(6) Na1rada went to Kha1n2d2avaprastha and advised them,

<>prastha. Even before the Ra1jasu1ya S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna
<>and Bhi1masena together killed Jara1sandha. After that
<>Yudhis2t2hira sent Arjuna to the northern side and the
<>other brothers to the southern side for Digvijaya (con-
<>quest of countries). When he established his autocracy
<>he performed the Ra1jasu1ya. (Chapter 45, Sabha1
<>Parva).
<NI>(13) Yudhis2t2hira used to give free sumptuous food to
<>thousands of brahmins in golden pots daily. (Chapter 49,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(14) Envious Duryodhana sent Vidura to bring Dharma-
<>putra to Hastina1pura and defeated him foully in a game
<>of dice. Though Dharmaputra lost everything Dhr2tara1-
<>s2t2ra gave him back everything. (Chapter 72, Sabha1
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(15) Before Dharmaputra went back to his place, with the
<>permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Duryodhana called him back
<>again for another game of dice. Despite protests from
<>all sides Dharmaputra went again for a game of dice
<>with Duryodhana and lost again all he possessed. Then
<>he left the country with his brothers and wife to spend
<>twelve years in exile in the forests and another year
<>incognito. (Chapter 79, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(16) Su1rya gave the Aks2ayapa1tra (a pot which is never

<>they returned to Dvaitavana.
<NI>(24) When they went to Ka1myaka vana S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a visited
<>Dharmaputra there. (Chapter 153. Vana Parva).
<NI>(25) Duryodhana and his followers made a grand march
<>to Ka1myaka vana to see the Pa1n2d2avas in sad plight
<>and there the Gandharva Citrasena bound them all by

<>all released. (Chapter 246, Vana Parva).
<NI>(26) While the Pa1n2d2avas were in exile in the forest
<>Dus4s4a1sana went and invited Yudhis2t2hira to attend a
<>Vais2n2ava sacrifice conducted by Duryodhana. But
<>Dharmaputra sent him away saying that it was not

<NI>7) {%How Dharmadava tested Yudhis2t2hira.%} The Pa1n2d2avas
<>travelling through the forests reached Dvaitavana. A
<>brahmin among their group was making fire by the
<>aran2i sticks when a deer rushed at him and took the
<>aran2i sticks away, carrying them on its horns. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas ran after the deer and they travelled far
<>away from their place, still not getting scent of it. They
<>were all tired and thirsty. Yudhis2t2hira directed
<>Nakula to climb on the top of a tree and investigate
<>whether there was any water anywhere nearby. Nakula
<>did so and reported that he could see a pond not far
<>from the place where they were sitting. Yudhis2-
<>t2hira asked Nakula to go and fetch water. Nakula did
<>not return for a long time and Sahadeva was asked to
<>go and enquire. Sahadeva also did not return and
<>Arjuna was sent in search of them. When Arjuna did
<>not return Bhi1masena went to enquire. Bhi1masena also
<>did not return and finally Yudhis2t2hira himself set out in
<>search of them. On reaching the pond Yudhis2t2hira
<>was dumbfounded to see his brothers lying dead on
<>the banks of the pond. Weeping bitterly Yudhis2t2hira
<>entered the pond and to his surprise he heard a voice
<>from the air addressed to him thus: “Ho, Yudhis2t2hira,
<>I am a stork living on the small fishes of this pond.
<>This pond is my hereditary property. It was I who
<>killed your brothers. I will ask you certain questions.
<>If you answer them correctly you can drink from this
<>pond. If not, you will also die.
<NI>Dharmaputra:--“I do not believe that you are simply
<>a bird. My brothers are renowned for their valour and
<>have defeated not only the devas, da1navas, gandharvas
<>and ra1ks2asas but also the four huge mountains like
<>Hima1laya Pa1riya1tra, Vindhya and Malaya. I am eager
<>to know your true self who have slain such brave
<>brothers of mine.”
<NI>Yaks2a:--“I am a Yaks2a and not merely a bird. I
<>objected to your brothers' taking water from the pond. [Page228-b+ 64]
<>But waving aside my objections they started taking
<>water from the pond and then I slew them. Now,
<>hear my questions: Who carries the Sun? Who are his
<>followers? Who makes the sun set? On whom does
<>the sun exist?”
<NI>Dharmaputra:--It is Brahman who carries the Sun.
<>Devas are his followers. Dharma makes him set. He
<>exists on Satya.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How does Maha1siddhi come to he S4rotriyas?
<>(those who study the Vedas).
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--It happens by deep penance.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the reason for a brahmin getting divi-
<>nity? What deed is equal to good conduct? What makes
<>a brahmin mortal and what makes him evil?
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--The Brahmin gets divinity by medita-
<>tion. Austerity is equal to good conduct. Death makes
<>a brahmin mortal and abusive words make him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the divinity of Ks2atriyas? What is
<>equal to good nature? What makes them mortal and
<>what makes them evil?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The divinity of a Ks2atriya is weapon.
<>Sacrifice is equal to good conduct. Fear makes him
<>mortal and non-sacrifice makes him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the best thing for agriculture? What
<>is the most important thing for agriculture? What are
<>the installations of the atmosphere and child-birth?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The best thing for agriculture is rain.
<>The important thing for agriculture is seed. The ins-
<>tallation of atmosphere is rays and that of child-birth
<>is child.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is lifeless even though he breathes?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--He who never offers oblations to a
<>deva, a guest or a servant is like the dead even though
<>he breathes.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is bigger than the earth? What is higher
<>than the sky? What is swifter than the wind? What
<>are greater in number than grass?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Mother is bigger than the earth.
<>Father is taller than the sky. Mind is swifter than the
<>wind. Thoughts are greater in number than grass.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is it that does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep? What is it that does not grow after birth? What
<>is heartless? What grows very quickly?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A fish does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep. An egg does not grow after its birth. A stone
<>is heartless. A river grows very quickly.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a friend to one who lives outside his
<>country? Who is a friend to a householder, to a patient
<>and to one dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--For one who leaves his country the
<>friend he gets on his way is the best friend. To a house-
<>holder his wife is his friend, to a patient his doctor and
<>to one dead, charity.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a guest of all? What is Nectar? What
<>is spread throughout the world?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Agni (fire) is the guest of all. Moon
<>(Candra) is the nectar. Air is that which is spread
<>throughout the world.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who circles around solo? Who is born again?
<>What is the remedy for cold? What gives the maximum
<>yield?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The Sun circles solo. Candra is born
<>again. Fire is the remedy for cold. Earth gives the
<>maximum yield. [Page229-a+ 64]
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the soul of Man? Who is the com-
<>panion given by God? What is Upaji1vana?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The soul of Man is his son. The com-
<>panion given by God is wife. Cloud is Upaji1vana.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How do you become rich? How do you be-
<>come happy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--If you abandon lust you will be rich.
<>If you abandon desire you will be happy.
<NI>Yaks2a:--By what is this world covered? By what does
<>the world become clear? By what does one lose his
<>friend? What is the obstacle for an entry into heaven?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Dullness covers the world. World
<>becomes clear by intelligence. A friend is lost by desire.
<>Domestic ties stand in the way of getting into heaven.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who are those equal to the dead? Which
<>country is dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A poor penniless man is equal to the
<>dead. The country where there is mob-rule is dead.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a pandit? Who is an atheist? Who is
<>wicked? What are lust and jealousy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A righteous man is a pandit. An
<>atheist is wicked. Lust is the cause of worldly life.
<>Jealousy is the cause of worry.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Though charity, wealth and lust are incom-
<>patible with each other when do they unite together?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--When charity and wife compromise
<>the above three blend together harmoniously.
<NI>The Yaks2a was highly pleased with the replies given by
<>Dharmaputra. He then offered to revive one of his bro-
<>thers and asked Dharmaputra to name whom he should
<>do so. Then Yudhis2t2hira named Nakula. Yaks2a then
<>enquired why he had named Nakula leaving aside Arjuna
<>and Bhi1ma. Dharmaputra replied that though Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1 were two wives of Pa1n2d2u they were both
<>mothers to them and so he wanted to see one of the
<>sons of Ma1dri1 alive. He therefore pressed the name of
<>Nakula again. The Yaks2a who was none other than
<>Dharmadeva was immensely happy to hear that reply
<>and gave life to all his brothers. He confessed to
<>Yudhis2t2hira that it was he who in the form of a deer
<>came and ran away with the aran2i sticks. He returned
<>the aran2i sticks also. Dharmadeva then advised them
<>to go and spend their life incognito at the court of King
<>Vira1t2a blessing them with the assurance that they
<>would never be found out during their life in disguise.
<>Dharmadeva disappeared after this and the Pa1n2d2avas
<>returned to their a1s4rama. (Chapters 312 and 313 of
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).

<NI>(28) Yudhis2t2hira slew Candrasena and Drumasena who

<NI>(30) He killed the younger brother of S4alya. (S4loka 64,

<>ter 62, S4alya Parva).
<NI>10) {%Yudhis2t2hira is crowned King.%} When Yudhis2t2hira won
<>the war he sent Nakula to bring Pa1n5ca1li1. He went
<>round the Kuruks2etra battle ground and saw his own
<>kith and kin lying dead and the sight made him faint.
<>After that he went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Ga1ndha1ri1 cursed
<>him for killing her sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 gave a piercing
<>look at the nails on the foot of Dharmaputra when he
<>stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 bowing down, Instantly the
<>nails turned black. Yudhis2t2hira gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the
<>names of all the prominent persons who were killed in
<>the war Dhr2tara1s2t2ra ordered Yudhis2t2hira to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. It was at this stage that Yudhis2t2hira
<>came to know from Kunti1 that Karn2a was his brother.
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept bitterly when he knew the secret from
<>his mother and cursed womankind as a whole stating
<>that woman would thereafter be incapable of keeping a
<>secret to herself. The news of the death of Karn2a gave
<>a sudden mental turn-back to Yudhis2t2hira and he
<>decided to renounce all and go to the forest. He
<>called aside his followers and announced his decision to
<>them. At that time Vya1sa came there and preached to
<>him about the perishable nature of life. Yudhis2t2hira
<>then asked him what he should do for the atonement
<>of the sins committed. Though he strongly desired to
<>go to the forest Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did not allow him
<>to do so and sent them all to Hastina1pura. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas entered the city the people gave them a
<>rousing reception and Yudhis2t2hira was crowned King.

<NI>11) {%Administration.%} When Yudhis2t2hira became King,
<>with the permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, he distributed the
<>various administrative responsibilities among his bro-
<>thers. He took for himself the task of taking care of
<>their kith and kin and friends. He gave many gifts to
<>the brahmins and other dependants. He once went to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to express his gratitude for him. He visited
<>Bhi1s2ma lying on his bed of arrows accompanied by
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his brothers. Bhi1s2ma revealed to him
<>the inner import of Ra1jadharma, A1paddharma and
<>Moks2adharma. Receiving the blessings of Bhi1s2ma
<>Yudhis2t2hira and his brothers returned to Hastina1pura.
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to the Hima1layas to get riches from
<>Marutta before performing an As4vamedha Sacrifice.
<>While on his way to the Hima1layas he fasted for a night
<>and worshipped S4iva. People like Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>partook in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice was over
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra desired to go to forest and sought the
<>approval of Yudhis2t2hira to do so. On hearing that
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept. But on the advice of Vya1sa he gave his
<>approval for Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to go to forest. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>appealed to him through Vidura for funds to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. Bhi1ma objected to this but [Page230-b+ 65]
<>Yudhis2t2hira reprimanded him and silenced him and
<>gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra enough funds for his purposes. Kunti1
<>and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to the forest.
<>Yudhis2t2hira accompanied by Pa1n5ca1li1 and Sahadeva
<>went and saw them in the forests after a few days.

<NI>12) {%Vidura merges into Dharmaputra.%} When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 went to forest Vidura also accepted
<>sannya1sa and left for the forest. There sitting under a
<>tree he started doing penance. After a few days Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira came to the forest to see his mother and others.
<>After spending some time with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 he went to the place where Vidura was
<>doing penance. Vidura started running the moment he
<>set eyes on Yudhis2t2hira and the latter ran after him.
<>After some time Vidura turned back and stood staring
<>at Yudhis2t2hira. At that time the soul of Vidura escap-
<>ing from his body merged with that of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>The body of Vidura stood stiff and leaned against a tree.
<>Taking him to be dead Yudhis2t2hira started to do the
<>funeral rites and then there resounded a voice from
<>heaven saying that Vidura was not dead. The unknown
<>voice was from Dharmadeva. When the voice subsided
<>Vidura became his old self again. Yudhis2t2hira went
<>back. (Chapter 26, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>13) {%The end of Dharmaputra.%} Soon after his return from
<>the forest Na1rada came to Hastina1pura and told him of
<>the death of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1 in a
<>wild fire in the forest. Lamenting deeply Yudhis2t2hira
<>performed the obsequies at Hastina1pura. It was at
<>this time that the Ya1dava dynasty perished and Dva1raka1
<>was sunk into the ocean. The Pa1n2d2avas then crowned
<>Pari1ks2it as their successor and entrusted Yuyutsu with
<>the administration of the State till Pari1ks2it came of age.
<>Vajra was appointed as chief of Indraprastha. The
<>obsequies of Va1sudeva, Balara1ma and Kr2s2n2a were per-
<>formed at Hastina1pura. Kr2pa1ca1rya was appointed as
<>preceptor to Pari1ks2it. After having made all such
<>arrangements the Pa1n2d2avas commenced their Maha1pras-
<>tha1na. The five Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 started from
<>Hastina1pura. A dog also followed them. Yudhis2t2hira
<>walked ahead. On the way, one by one, Pa1n5ca1li1 Saha-
<>deva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhi1masena fell dead. Alone
<>with a dog to keep company, Yudhis2t2hira reached a
<>plateau on the top of the Hima1layas and there Indra
<>was waiting for him with a chariot. But Yudhis2t2hira
<>said that he would not come to heaven without his
<>wife and brothers. He was then informed that they had
<>already reached heaven. Yudhis2t2hira insisted that the
<>dog also should be taken to heaven which Indra
<>blankly refused. But Yudhis2t2hira refused to ascend the
<>chariot without the dog which, he said, had given him
<>company from the start to the finish. The dog then
<>changed itself into Dharmadeva and he complimented
<>him on his sense of justice. When Yudhis2t2hira entered
<>heaven he saw Duryodhana sitting in all luxury and glory.
<>Yudhis2t2hira did not like it but Na1rada pacified him.
<>Yudhis2t2hira saw all his relatives sitting there. A devadu1ta
<>took him round hell also. When he heard the pitiable
<>groans from there Yudhis2t2hira thought his right place
<>was with them. But Indra and Dharmadeva again con-
<>soled him. He was given a bath in A1ka1s4agan3ga1. He then
<>lost his mortal form and his soul entered Divyaloka. [Page231-a+ 64]
<>Standing in the form of Dharmadeva he saw all his
<>relatives including Kr2s2n2a. (Chapters 38 and 39,

<HI>DHARMARA1JA. A king of Gaud2ades4a. He became
<>King at a time when Jainism was getting more and
<>more hold on the people and the Hindu Vedic rites
<>were getting less and less popular among the people.
<>The King thought it was his duty to revive the interest
<>in the Vedic rites and so became a priest himself
<>and did much propaganda on the superiority of the
<>same, writing several books on the subject for the benefit
<>of the people. (Bhavis2yapura1n2a, Pratisarga Parva).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA. A Brahmin. He had many children.
<>The major portion of his life was spent in hard work
<>to support his large family. After that he went in
<>search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he
<>happened to reach the realm of Na1gas (serpents). He
<>entered the house of a Na1ga named Padmana1bha.
<>When he reached the house Padmana1bha had been away
<>carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharma1ran2ya sat out-
<>side the house and spent a few days in vow and medita-
<>tion. Then Padmana1bha returned. The Bra1hman2a asked
<>Padmana1bha about the ways of attaining heaven. The
<>Na1ga replied that there was none superior to the Sun.
<>The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermit-
<>age of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, 4
<>Chapters from 361).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA(M). A forest which is a holy place.
<>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva Chapter 82

<>I).
<HI>DHARMARATHA. A king of the family of An3gara1ja.
<>He was the great grandfather of Lomapa1da and the son
<>of Draviratha. (Chapter 277, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHARMASAKHA. A king of the Kekaya line of Kings.
<>He had a hundred wives but no children. At last, at an
<>old age, he got a son of Sucandra1, wife of his elder
<>brother. But the hunderd wives of Dharmasakha were
<>pining for having a son and so the king consulted his
<>ministers and on their advice conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i
<>yajn5a (a sacred sacrificial ceremony for obtaining chil-
<>dren) at Hanu1matkun2d2a near the southern sea-coast.
<>As a result of that each of his hundred wives got a
<>child. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapter 15).
<HI>DHARMAS4ARMA1 I. A brahmin who was born a parrot
<>named Kan5jala in his rebirth. Dharmas4arma1 was one of [Page231-b+ 65]
<>the three sons of an eminent Brahmin called Vidya1dhara.
<>His other two sons were Vasus4arma1 and Na1mas4arma1.
<>While both his brothers became great scholars Dhar-
<>mas4arma1 never studied anything and became a muff.
<>His father was greatly worried on account of this.
<>Dharmas4arma1 never heeded the advice of his father
<>and went about in bad company ruining himself. Years
<>went by and Dharmas4arma1 became old.
<NI>One day Dharmas4arma1 was sitting repentant in a
<>temple sadly pondering over his past when a siddha
<>came to the temple. Watching him Dharmas4arma1 saw
<>him go and sit in a lonely place for meditation with his
<>eyes shut. Dharmas4arma1 went and stood near him
<>very respectfully. When the Siddha opened his eyes
<>after some time he saw Dharmas4arma1 standing before
<>him and then the Siddha made enquiries about Dhar-
<>mas4arma1. The latter then requested the Siddha to give
<>him instructions to acquire the supreme knowledge.
<>The Siddha then gave him Jn5a1nopades4a (advice on
<>knowledge) and Dharmas4arma1 soon became a Siddha
<>himself. He then started on a pilgrimage and on the
<>way he got a parrot. He took care of the bird just like
<>his son and loved it very affectionately. One day when
<>Dharmas4arma1 was away from the place to collect
<>fruits for his food a cat caught and ate the parrot.
<>Greatly grief-stricken Dharmas4arma1 wept bitterly and
<>ran about like a mad man. After some days he died
<>and because at the time of death he was thinking about
<>the parrot he was born a parrot in his next birth. The
<>jn5a1nopades4a of the siddha was still lingering in him
<>while he died and so even in his life as a parro the never
<>lost the jn5a1na he had acquired in his previous life.

<>he saw Ka1pakalpa, the servant of merchant Ratna1kara,
<>being killed by an ox. Though Ka1pakalpa was a sinner,
<>his end aroused pity in the heart of the Brahmin. So he
<>sprinkled the Ganges-water on the body of Ka1pakalpa,
<>who instantly regained life and energy. The Brahmin
<>who saw the power of Ganges-water began to worship
<>the Ganges from that day onwards. It is mentioned in
<>Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Khan2d2a, Chapter 7, that finally
<>the Brahmin got a boon from the Ganges that only
<>uttering the name of the Ganges should he meet with

<HI>DHARMAVARN2A. A Brahmin who lived in the country
<>of A1narta at the end of Kaliyuga. Once when he went
<>to the land of the dead, he saw his fathers hanging by
<>the end of darbha. They requested Dharmavarn2a to
<>marry and obtain sons who would get them relief from
<>their plight. Dharmavarn2a married and as soon as he
<>got a son he went to the forest of Gandhama1dana to

<HI>DHARMAVYA1DHA. Though he was born in the caste
<>of foresters he became a saint by following the path of
<>duty and righteousness. In his previous birth he was a
<>Brahmin. He was a friend of a king who was an adept
<>in archery. Once both went on hunting expedition to the
<>forest. The brahmin sent an arrow at a wild animal but
<>the arrow went and struck a sage who was doing
<>penance under a tree. When the sage was rolling on the
<>arrow he said: “Oh, evil-natured Bra1hman2a, may you
<>be born as a hunter selling flesh in your next life.” The
<>Brahmin went and apologised to the sage and craved
<>for pardon. Taking pity on him the sage consoled him
<>by saying that though he would be born as such, he
<>would be a great scholar and attain moks2a by doing his
<>duty without even once wavering from it.
<NI>The Brahmin was born a hunter in the country of
<>Mithila1 He took to looking after his parents as a vow
<>and soon became a top-ranking righteous man. He did
<>his duty to which he was born. He sold meat and
<>earned a living. He never killed or butchered an animal.
<>One day a Brahmin named Kaus4ika was doing penance
<>sitting under a tree when a crane perched on the top
<>of its branches defiled the Brahmin's head with its
<>droppings. The Brahmin in rage looked up and his
<>powerful stare burnt the crane and it fell down dead.
<>Leaving that place some time later he went to a house
<>to beg. The house-wife informed him that he would be
<>given alms only after attending to her husband. The
<>Brahmin was not pleased with her reply. Seeing that she
<>added “Please do not look at me like that. I am no
<>crane. To me my husband is supreme.”
<NI>The Brahmin was taken aback when he heard the lady
<>mention the incident of the crane. The lady explained
<>to him that all her powers were due to her devotion to
<>her husband and advised the Brahmin to go and meet
<>Dharmavya1dha of Mithila1 to remove the egoism in him.
<>Obeying her instructions Kaus4ika went and accepted
<>Dharmavya1dha as his guru. The learned hunter then
<>spoke to Kaus4ika about Varn2adharmas, S4is2t2a1ca1ras,
<>him3sa1 and ahim3sa1, Mi1ma1m3sa1 relating to dharma and
<>karma, the importance and glory of Brahmavidya1, the
<>significance of the control of the senses, Trigun2as, Pra1n2a-
<>va1yu, service to father and mother and many such

<HI>DHENUTI1RTHA. A holy place. If gingelly (tila) is [Page233-b+ 64]

<HI>DHI1MA1N. Second son of Puru1ravas. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 75, Stanza 24).
<HI>DHI1RADHI1. A brahmin devotee of S4iva. He lived in
<>Ka1s4i1. Because he meditated on S4iva alone, S4iva was
<>pleased with him and helped him in various ways.
<NI>The gan2as of S4iva were amazed at S4iva's partiality for
<>Dhi1radhi1. Paramas4iva told them the story of the former
<>birth of Dhi1radhi1. “This Brahmin was a swan in his
<>former life. Once he was flying over a lake when he
<>became tired and fell down. His colour became black.
<>Then Kamalini1, another swan who dwelt in the same
<>lake told him to recite the tenth Chapter of Gi1ta1, and
<>to meditate on S4iva. Because the swan did that holy
<>act, he was born a Brahmin in his next birth. Though
<>he was a Brahmin in his previous birth, he kicked his
<>teacher and for that fault he had to take birth as a
<>swan. Later, because of the love of S4iva, Dhi1radhi1
<>attained heaven. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 184).
<HI>DHI1ROS2N2I. A god concerned with S4ra1ddha (offering

<>Manu. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>DHR2S2T2ABUDDHI. A Vais4ya who attained heaven by
<>performing the fast of Vais4a1kha Vrata. He lived in the
<>country of Bhadra1vati1, on the bank of the River
<>Sarasvati1. The name of the king of the country was
<>Dhr2tima1n. Dhanapa1la, a Vais4ya of that country had
<>five sons: Sumanas, Dyutima1n, Medha1vi1, Sukr2ta and
<>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi. The last of them turned out to be a
<>wicked man. Going after many women, keeping
<>company with wicked people, gambling, wandering
<>about in search of harlots, not venerating Gods, Manes
<>or Bra1hman2as, wasting the money of his father, eating
<>untouchable food, drinking liquor and such other acts,
<>he indulged in. Once he was seen walking in the
<>street with his hand on the shoulder of a harlot. So his
<>father turned him out of the house. He was discarded
<>by his relatives too. He sold the ornaments he had on
<>his body. When that was finished the harlots also
<>evaded him. He became a destitute having no money
<>or clothes. When he became tired with hunger and
<>thirst he began stealing in that city. The King's men
<>caught him. They chained him and scourged him.
<>Finally, he went to the forest and with a bow and
<>arrows he lived by hunting.
<NI>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi happened to reach the hermitage of
<>Kaun2d2inya. It was the month of Vais4a1kha. While
<>Kaun2d2inya was coming from the Ganges, having taken
<>bath, a drop of water fell on Dhr2s2t2abuddhi from the
<>wet cloth of the hermit, and consequently his sins were
<>washed off. He fell before the hermit and requested
<>him to instruct him in the way of attaining heaven. [Page234-a+ 65]
<>The hermit advised him to observe the fast of Vais4a1kha-
<>s4uklaika1das4i1 known as Mohini1. Accordingly he observed
<>the fast and became sinless. Invested with a divine form
<>he entered the realm of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Chapter 51).
<HI>DHR2S2T2ADYUMNA. The son of King Drupada. He was
<>brother of Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Drupada and Dron2a were fellow students. After
<>finishing his education Drupada became King. When
<>Dron2a came to his palace Drupada did not honour
<>him. Dron2a got angry, went to Hastina1pura and began
<>to teach the Pa1n2d2ava and the Kaurava princes in
<>archery and other weapons. When the weapon-training
<>was over, Arjuna, at the instruction of Dron2a, defeated
<>and captured Drupada. Dron2a seized half of his king-
<>dom from him.
<NI>As Drupada was not powerful to wreak vengeance on
<>Dron2a, he performed a sacrifice to obtain a son who
<>could take revenge on Dron2a and regain his lost
<>prestige. A son and a daughter were born from the
<>sacrificial fire. The son was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna.
<>The daughter grew up and became the famous Pa1n5ca1li1.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas married her.
<NI>At the time of birth, Dhr2s2t2adyumna had a crown on
<>his head, and armour on his body, bow, arrows and
<>sword in his hands. He ran out of the fire into a
<>chariot and sat in it as if he were about to begin a
<>travel of conquest. Seeing this the Pa1n5ca1las were filled
<>with joy. There was a celestial voice: “This boy will
<>destroy the fear of the Pa1n5ca1las. He is born to slay
<>Dron2a.” At this time the queen approached the sacri-
<>ficing priest with a request that the children born of the
<>sacrificial fire should consider her as their mother.
<>Accordingly the children accepted the wife of Drupada
<>as their mother. Bra1hman2as named the boy Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna and the girl Kr2s2n2a1.
<F>1. The fast taken on the eleventh day of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Vais4a1kha.</F>
<F>2. Because he was born with Dhr2s2t2atva (boldness) amars2atva (impatience) and dyumna (vigour) the son of Drupada was
<>called Dhr2s2t2adyumna. Draupadi1 was called Kr2s2n2a as she was of Kr2s2n2a varn2a (dark complexion. Thus Drupada got two children from
<>‘Makha’ (sacrifice).</F> (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>166). (For more particulars see under ‘Pa1n5ca1li1’
<>Para 2).
<NI>2) {%Till the battle of Bha1rata.%} The history of Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna till the battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas, is given below.
<NI>The news that Dhr2s2t2adyumna was born to kill Dron2a
<>spread everywhere. The Broad-minded Dron2a did not
<>seem to mind this news. Dron2a took Dhr2s2t2adyumna to
<>his house, with the permission of Drupada and gave
<>him training in the wielding of weapons. He believed
<>that God's will could not be thwarted. After he had
<>learned archery Dhr2s2t2adyumna returned to his kingdom.
<>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna at the svayam3vara
<>(marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li. Several kings arrived from
<>various countries on that occasion. When the auspici-
<>ous moment came, Dhr2s2t2adyumna brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to
<>the nuptial dais. He proclaimed the rules and condi-
<>tions that the competitors of Svayam3vara had to
<>observe. After that he conversed with each king who
<>was present. In the Svayam3vara Pa1n5ca1li1 accepted
<>Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 were given the
<>Kumbhaka1ra mandira (the Palace of Kumbhaka1ra) which
<>stood in the city of Drupada, to stay for that night.
<>Though the Pa1n2d2avas were in the guise of Bra1hman2as,
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna had his own doubts about their identity. [Page234-b+ 61]
<>So he hid himself somehwere in the Palace and kept an
<>eye on them. This shows his peculiar trait of obser-
<>vation. After this he returned to his Palace and
<>pacified his father who had been much worried about
<>his daughter's selection.
<NI>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna, during the time of the
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas. He consoled Pa1n5ca1li1, who
<>was miserable. After that he took the sons of Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>to his house. While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the
<>forest ‘Ka1myaka’, Dhr2s2t2adyumna visited them. The
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas came to an end. A battle
<>between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas became inevi-
<>table. Then the Pa1n2davas selected Dhr2s2t2adyumna, as
<>the commander-in-general of their army. He ordered
<>for a general parade of the army and gave them
<>instructions. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 166 to 195;
<>the whole of Sabha1 Parva; Vana Parva, Chapters, 12, 22
<>and 51; Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 72; Udyoga Parva,

<>two wives Gan3ga1 and Satyavati1. Ga1n3ga1, gave birth to
<>eight sons. But seven of them were thrown into the
<>river Gan3ga1. Giving the eighth son Bhi1s2ma to S4antanu
<>Gan3ga1 disappeared. S4antanu then married Satyavati1,
<>a fisher-woman. Satyavati1 gave birth to two sons, Cit-
<>ra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya. When S4antanu grew old,
<>Citra1n3gada was anointed as King, as Bhi1s2ma had taken
<>Brahmavrata (vow of celibacy). Once when Citra1n3-
<>gada went to the forest for hunting, a Gandharva of the
<>name Citra1n3gada killed him. So Vicitravi1rya became
<>the King of Hastina1pura. Bhi1s2ma took the three daugh-
<>ters of the King of Ka1s4i, Amba1, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 [Page236-a+ 65]
<>by force into his chariot and brought the last two, to
<>Hastina1pura to be given as wives to Vicitravi1rya. On
<>the way he sent Amba1 back. Vicitravi1rya married Am-
<>bika1 and Amba1lika1. But shortly after that he also died,
<>before any children were born to him. Fearing that the
<>Lunar dynasty would come to an end, Satyavati1 brought
<>her son Vedavya1sa, who was born to her from hermit
<>Para1s4ara, before her marriage, to Hastina1pura. In the
<>night Satyavati1 sent Ambika1 adorned with ornaments
<>and costly garments, to the bedroom of Vya1sa. But she
<>could not bear to lie with Vya1sa who was clad in barks
<>of the tree and wearing matted hair. Still thinking that
<>it was not right on her part to stand against the wish of
<>her mother, she approached Vya1sa and lay with him
<>with closed eyes. Ambika1 became pregnant. The child
<>she gave birth to, was blind. That child was Dhr2tara1s2t2r2a.
<>Next night Amba1lika1 approached Vya1sa. When she
<>saw Vya1sa she turned pale at his uncouth figure and
<>her face became bloodless. So the child born to her was
<>pale and was called Pa1n2d2u. Next night the maid of the
<>queen approached Vya1sa with a joyful heart and so she
<>got Vidura as son, who was extremely wise and intelli-
<>gent. Thus Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura became sons
<>of the same father.
<F>1. It is stated in M.B. A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 7 that Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born as the incarnation of a Gandharva
<>having the name Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (See under Dhr2tara1s2t2ra III).</F> (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters, 63
<>and 105).

<>returned to forest and since then Bhi1s2ma stood in place
<>of father to the children. Bhi1s2ma performed ‘Upanay-
<>ana’ (investiture with Brahma-string) and other rites
<>of the children. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura had
<>their education in Hastina1pura. (M.B. A1di Parva,

<NI>4) {%Marriage and birth of children.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came of
<>marriageable age. Bhi1s2ma had heard about Ga1ndha1ri1,
<>daughter of Subala, the King of Ga1ndha1ra, as a beauti-
<>ful damsel of good qualities. Moreover she had acquired
<>a boon from S4iva that hundred sons would be born to
<>her. Bhi1s2ma sent a messenger to Subala with a request
<>to give Ga1ndha1ri1 as wife to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Subala was
<>not much pleased at the aspect of getting a blind man
<>as son-in-law. Still he thought of the prestige his family
<>would get by a marriage alliance with the kings of the
<>Pu1ru Dynasty, and finally agreed. Ga1ndha1ri1 submitted
<>to the will of her father, and to live with a husband who [Page236-b+ 63]
<>was blind. She tied her eyes with a cloth. S4akuni the
<>son of Subala brought Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1pura, and
<>gave her to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. With the sanction of Bhi1s2ma
<>their marriage took place.
<NI>Once Ga1ndha1ri1 feasted Vya1sa who came tired with hun-
<>ger and thirst. The hermit was pleased with her and
<>blessed her to have hundred sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 became
<>pregnant. But even after two years no delivery took place.
<>She crushed her womb by force and a lump of flesh
<>came out. At that time Vya1sa came there. He cut the
<>lump into hundred pieces and kept them in ghee-pots.
<>Gandha1ri1 had a desire to get a daughter also. Vya1sa
<>who had known it had cut the lump in such a way that
<>there was a small piece in excess. The pots broke by
<>themselves in due course and hundred sons and a
<>daughter were born. The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1.
<>A son named Yuyutsu also was born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of a
<>Vais4ya woman. Duryodhana was the eldest of the
<>hundred sons. The children grew up. Dus4s4ala1 was

<>a curse from a hermit that he would die if his wife tou-
<>ched him. With that Pa1n2d2u retired to forest with his
<>wives. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved at the separation of
<>his brother. Pa1n2d2u died in the forest and Ma1dri1 jumped
<>into fire and died with her husband. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked
<>Vidura to perform their cremation rites. After that
<>Yudhis2t2hira became King. The Pa1n2d2avas became more
<>and more prosperous. This made the heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>cloudy. He gave sanction to Duryodhana to transfer the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to the lac house in Va1ran2a1vata. The lac house
<>caught fire and it was rumoured that the Pa1n2d2avas died
<>in the lac house fire, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra shed crocodile
<>tears, and ordered for the mourning and oblation to
<>be performed. After the marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1, it came to
<>be known that the Pa1n2d2avas were alive and that they
<>were living with Drupada. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra recalled them and
<>gave them half of the country. The Pa1n2d2avas made
<>Indraprastha their capital and began to rule the king-
<>dom. Yudhis2t2hira performed the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(royal consecration). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra also took part in the
<>sacrifice.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge Yudhis2t2hira to a
<>game of dice. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed but advised Duryo-
<>dhana not to live in enmity with the Pa1n2d2avas. The
<>game of dice was played, and Yudhis2t2hira lost every-
<>thing the Pa1n2d2avas had. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called Pa1n5ca1li1
<>and told her that she might ask any boon. She request-
<>ed that her husband Dharmaputra might b{??} exempt-
<>ed from servitude and the Pa1n2d2avas made free. Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra compelled her to ask for more boons. She replied
<>that according to law Vais4yas were eligible for one boon,
<>Ks2atriya women two boons, Kings three boons and
<>Bra1hman2as hundred boons, and since she had already
<>taken two boons, she wanted no more. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra who
<>was pleased at this reply gave the Pa1n2d2avas freedom
<>and returned all their lost wealth.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge the Pa1n2d2avas for a
<>game of dice again. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed. This time also
<>Yudhis2t2hira lost the game. The Pa1n2d2avas who had lost
<>everything, were ordered to go to forest for twelve years
<>and to live incognito for one year. The Pa1n2d2avas went [Page237-a+ 65]
<>to the forest with Pa1n5ca1li1. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved.
<NI>After thirteen years the Pa1n2d2avas returned. Duryo-
<>dhana said that not an inch of land would be given to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra felt sorry at this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>came to talk about conciliation. Duryodhana wanted to
<>take him a prisoner. But Dhr2tara1s2t2ra opposed it. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a showed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra his Vis4varu1pa (cosmic form)
<>to see which, Kr2s2n2a gave him sight for the time being
<>for which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was very thankful. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas came to Kuruks2etra for Bha1rata-battle.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called San5jaya to him and asked him about
<>the preparations the parties had made for war. San5jaya
<>gave a true description of the battle arrays of both
<>parties. (M.B. A1di Parva. Sabha1 Parva, Vana Parva,

<NI>(6) {%Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the battle of Bha1rata.%} The terrible
<>battle began. The heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved with
<>sorrow. When Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jaya-

<>S4a1tyaki had destroyed the army of the Kauravas he
<>became dumb with grief. He praised Bhi1ma's valour
<>and blamed his sons. When San5jaya told him
<>about the fall of Karn2a, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra fell down
<>unconscious. He rose up again and attended to the
<>noises from the battlefield. He fell down again when
<>he knew that S4alya and Duryodhana were killed. He
<>rose again and cried for a long time. He gathered the
<>women-folk, his people and went to the battlefield.
<>He broke the metal statue of Bhi1ma and embraced the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He asked Yudhis2t2hira to do the mourning
<>and offerings for the dead. It was done accordingly.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas respected Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. But Bhi1ma
<>scolded them. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 were greatly
<>depressed and asked Yudhis2t2hira to permit them to live
<>in forest. Yudhis2t2hira tried to prevent it. He kissed on
<>the head of Yudhis2t2hira. Seeing that they did not eat
<>food he asked them to eat. Yudhis2t2hira saw that they
<>would eat only if he permitted them to live in forest.
<>At last Yudhis2t2hira agreed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted

<>and offerings for the dead on a large scale (M.B. Dron2a

<>which would become a prop of the world. Accordingly,

<NI>Brahma1 was born in the lotus from the navel of Vis2n2u,
<>who was lying in meditation on the surface of water.
<>From the ear-wax of Vis2n2u two asuras--Madhu and
<>Kait2abha sprang up. They terrified Brahma1 by sha-
<>king the stalk of the lotus. Brahma1 became terribly
<>afraid of the asuras and ran about on the surface of
<>water. Hearing the cry of Brahma1 Vis2n2u awoke, but
<>he could not defeat the asuras. Vis2n2u decided to
<>employ ‘Sa1ma’ (conciliation) the first expedient. The
<>arrogant demons ordered Vis2n2u to ask of them any
<>boon. Vis2n2u replied. “If it is so, you must be killed by
<>me.” They could not but give the boon. They agreed
<>to the request of Vis2n2u and said: “But we must be
<>killed in an atmosphere, which is not cloudy.” Vis2n2u
<>killed them when the atmosphere was clear.
<NI>A son named Dhundhu had been born to Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. Because Vis2n2u had killed his fathers
<>Dhundhu decided to take revenge on Vis2n2u and the
<>Gods. With this idea in view Dhundhu began to do
<>penance in the sandy desert of Ujja1laka in Marudhanva.
<>Standing on one leg he did penance for thousands of
<>years. Then Brahma1 appeared before him and gave the
<>boon that he would not be killed by Devas, Da1navas
<>(asuras), Gandharvas (Demi-gods), Ra1ks2asas (demons),
<>Yaks2as (paragods) and Uragas (serpents). Having got
<>this boon, he lived under sand in the desert of Ujja1laka.
<>His idea was to destroy the gods.
<NI>A hermit named Uttan3ka had erected his hermitage in
<>another part of Marudhanva and began penance. By his
<>penance he made Vis2n2u appear before him and then
<>made a request that Dhundhu's activities be put a
<>stop to. Vis2n2u replied “Uttan3ka! Dhundhu has become
<>a curse to the three worlds. There is a king named
<>Kuvala1s4va, born of the dynasty of Iks2va1ku. He will
<>kill Dhundhu.” Saying these words, Vis2n2u disappear-
<>ed.
<NI>Uttan3ka went to the palace of Kuvala1s4va and told

<HI>DHYA1NA. (Meditation). Even from ancient times the
<>people of Bha1rata believed that heaven could be attain-
<>ed by meditation. There are scientific methods of
<>meditating upon God. They are described below:
<NI>The root “dhyai”, means “to think”. Dhya1na (medi-
<>tation) means thinking of God with concentration.
<>God is invisible and figureless. We can meditate only
<>upon some material that contains the attributes of God.
<>So dhya1na (meditation) is to fix the mind on the
<>object of meditation, and to imagine that particular
<>object in a particular place and to concentrate the
<>mind upon it. One who casts off his body, while engag-
<>ed in meditation attains ‘Sa1yujya’ (oneness with God). [Page241-a+ 64]
<NI>He who can meditate upon God, with concentration
<>of mind even for a moment or two can attain heaven.
<>The fruits he attains are far greater than the fruits
<>attained by performing great sacrifices and offerings.
<>For meditation, there are four factors: Dhya1ta1 (the
<>meditator), Dhya1na (the act of meditation) Dhyeya
<>(the object meditated upon) and Dhya1naprayojana
<>(the attainment by meditation). He who indulges in
<>meditation is the meditator. The act done by him is
<>meditation. That which is meditated upon is the object
<>of meditation. What the meditator obtains as a result
<>of his meditation is the attainment. A meditator should
<>be wise and virtuous, should have attention and patie-
<>nce, devoted to Vis2n2u and always energetic.
<NI>We can meditate upon God, walking, standing, sleeping
<>and awake. God should be consecrated in the centre of
<>the lotus chair of the heart and be worshipped with de-
<>votional meditation. It is to give practice in fixing the
<>mind firmly on a particular object, that the sages say
<>that some visible material object should be given to
<>meditate upon, in the early stage of meditation. When
<>concentration of mind is obtained by meditating upon
<>a visible object, it will be possible for us to meditate
<>upon an object which is not amenable to our senses.
<>When engaged in meditation we should be thinking
<>“Aham3 Brahma1 jyotira1tma1 va1sudevo vimukta Om3”. (I
<>am Brahma1, the light, the Spirit, Va1sudeva, and Vimukta
<>(having no connection with anything), OM). (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 374).
<HI>D2IBHAKA. A prince who, puffed up by the power of
<>boons and blessings from the gods, tried to harm sage
<>Durva1sas. Balabhadrara1ma killed him. The following
<>account occurs in the Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a.
<NI>Brahmadatta, King of Sa1lva, had two wives. No chil-
<>dren were born to them for several years. Brahmadatta's
<>minister, Mitrasaha, also had no children. Mitrasaha
<>was a brahmin and a scholar. On his advice, Brahma-
<>datta, with his wives, went to Kaila1sa and performed
<>tapas to please S4iva to get children. As a result of ten
<>years’ rigorous tapas S4iva was pleased and blessed
<>him that two sons would be born to him. Later his
<>wives gave birth to two sons. The son of the eldest
<>queen was named Ham3sa and that of the second queen
<>was named D2ibhaka. At this time a son was also born
<>to Mitrasaha, the minister by the blessing of Vis2n2u. That
<>child was named Jana1rdana.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka were spoilt, but Jana1rdana was
<>a bhakta of Vis2n2u. Ham3sa and D2ibhaka performed
<>tapas in their childhood to please S4iva and got invinci-
<>ble power and arrows. After that they became loka-
<>kan2t2akas (torturers) and went round the world. Once
<>they went to Kas4yapa's a1s4rama and destroyed the place
<>of worship. After that they went to the a1s4rama of
<>Durva1sas. There they tortured the sages and made the
<>sages naked who were wearing only loin cloth. Then
<>they returned.
<NI>Enraged by these, sage Durva1sas went to Dva1raka1
<>taking the destroyed loin-cloth and other articles. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and his courtiers stood up and saluted him when
<>they saw Durva1sas coming like sam3ha1rarudra. On
<>hearing the news, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a assured him that he would
<>kill Ham3sa and D2ibhaka and sent him back pacified.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka began a ra1jasu1ya. They sent
<>Jana1rdana to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a with the message that he should [Page241-b+ 63]
<>either fight with them or give them tribute (in the
<>form of money). Jana1rdana went to Dva1raka1, just as
<>Akru1ra, a devotee of Vis2n2u, went to Amba1d2i with the
<>message of Kam3sa. Immediately Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra
<>with the chief Ministers like Sa1tyaki went to Sa1lva. In
<>the war that followed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Ham3sa and Bala.
<>Bhadrara1ma killed D2ibhaka. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva,

<HI>DI1KS2A1. Di1ks2a1 is the vrata that expels sin and increases
<>Jn5a1na (wisdom). Those who are to be blessed fall into
<>three categories. The person who belongs to the first
<>category is called Vijn5a1nakala; the second is Pralaya-
<>kala; and the third is Sakala. Vijn5a1nakala is free from
<>sin alone. Pralayakala is free from sins and Karmans.
<>Sakala has everything from Kala1 to the earth. The
<>Di1ks2a1s to be practised by the three classes of persons
<>are of different kinds. Di1ks2a1 is classified into two:
<>“Nira1dha1ra and Sa1dha1ra.
<NI>Nira1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is performed for the sake of Vijn5a1na-
<>kala and Pralayakala. Sa1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is prescribed for
<>the third class of people, the Sakalas.
<HI>DILI1PA I. (Khat2va1n3ga). A mighty king of the Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See Das4aratha's Genealogy.
<NI>2) {%Reign and Birth of Son.%} Dili1pa is counted as one of the
<>noblest kings. His reign was extremely popular. But
<>even after a long period of married life, he had no
<>issue. His queen was Sudaks2in2a1, the princess of Maga-
<>dha. In order to get Vasis2t2ha's advice, Dili1pa and
<>Sudaks2in2a1 went to the sage's a1s4rama. After hearing
<>about their grievance, Vasis2t2ha meditated for a little
<>while and described why the royal couple were not
<>blessed with children:--“Long ago, Dili1pa had paid
<>a visit to Indra. While returning after the visit, he
<>passed by Ka1madhenu who was lying under the shade of
<>Kalpavr2ks2a. He paid no heed to her, as he did not
<>see her. The divine cow (Ka1madhenu) took this as
<>a personal slight to her and cursed the King that he
<>would not have children until he served and propitiat-
<>ed her daughter, Nandini1. Neither the King nor his
<>charioteer was aware of the curse. Ka1madhenu has
<>now gone to Pa1ta1la (underworld) to attend a sacrifice
<>of Varun2a. Therefore Dili1pa and his queen should
<>attend on and propitiate her daughter, Nandini1.”
<NI>From the next morning the King and queen began to
<>offer their services to Nandini1. The King followed her
<>as her shadow. After twentyone days, one morning
<>Nandini1 went to graze in a dense forest. As usual, the
<>King also followed her. As they reached the middle
<>of the woods, the King was enchanted for a moment
<>by the charm of the Sylvan scenery. Just then, on
<>turning round he saw a lion springing towards Nandini1
<>to prey upon her. Suddenly he took up his bow and
<>aimed an arrow at the lion, but to his great amaze-
<>ment, his hands were paralysed. The lion spoke to him
<>as follows:--“O King, you need not exert yourself in
<>vain. I am the servant of Lord S4iva. This holy deodar [Page242-a+ 64]
<>tree which you see in front of us, was planted and
<>tended by Pa1rvati1. My task is to protect this tree.
<>Pa1rvati1 and lord S4iva have authorized me to kill and
<>eat the animals which come this way. Therefore this
<>cow is my food.”
<NI>The king was in a fix. He begged the lion to spare
<>Nandini1 and to eat his (king's) body instead. The
<>lion agreed. The King put down his arms and stood
<>bowing down in front of the lion. Hearing the words,
<>“Beloved child, arise” he looked up, and the lion had
<>vanished. Just then Nandini1 told him that it was she
<>herself who had done this to test him. The King and
<>Nandini1 then returned to the A1s4rama. As a result of
<>Nandini1's blessing, the King's wife bore a son who
<>later became the celebrated emperor Raghu. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 198).
<NI>(3) {%Killing of the Asura, Vi1rasena.%} Once a powerful Asura
<>named Vi1rasena attacked Vais4ravan2a. When lord
<>S4iva came to know of it he tried to defeat Vi1rasena,
<>but in vain. At S4iva's request, Maha1vis2n2u entered the
<>scene. He was also unable to subdue the Asura.
<>Vis2n2u advised Vais4ravan2a to seek the help of Dili1pa.
<>Dili1pa went to Alaka1puri1 and encountered Vi1rasena.
<>Under the shower of arrows fram Dili1pa, blood began
<>to flow from the body of Vi1rasena. But each drop of
<>his blood came to life as a new Vi1rasena and all those
<>Vi1rasenas continued a ceaseless battle with Dili1pa.
<>At last Dili1pa prayed to Raktes4vari1 who suddenly
<>appeared and drank all the blood. In this way the king
<>managed to kill Vi1rasena. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(4) {%Dili1pa and the Holy Waters.%} Once king Dili1pa led
<>a saintly life on the bank of Gan3ga1, the sacred place
<>worshipped by Devas, R2s2is and Gandharvas. With
<>religious practices and offering pu1ja1 to Devas, R2s2is
<>and Pitr2s, he spent time in prayer and meditation.
<>One day he happened to meet Vasis2t2ha, and paid
<>homage to him. The sage Vasis2t2ha described to him
<>all the places of sacred waters and explained the great-
<>ness of each. (See under Khat2va1n3ga). (Padma Pura1n2a,

<>that Amba1, the daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1 performed
<>austere tapas (Penance). (See under Amba1).
<HI>D2IM3D2IKA. A rat who played a part in Bid2a1lopa1khya1na.
<>The story runs as follows:
<NI>Once a cat performed tapas, holding his hands up, on
<>the banks of the Ganges, when the found no way to get
<>food. Seeing the devotion of that cat all living beings
<>birds and animals began to worship him. Once the cat
<>called all rats and told them: “One cannot do spiritual
<>and physical deeds at the same time. So I will look after
<>your spiritual affairs. You should attend to my
<>physical needs. That is, bring me food, bathe me in
<>the Ganges, all these are your duties.”
<NI>The rats agreed to do so. They took him to the
<>Ganges, bathed him and gave him food. But, the cat,
<>whenever he got a chance caught a rat and ate it up
<>The cat's health improved day-by-day and the number
<>of rat's began to decrease. Among them, there was a
<>clever rat named D2imd2ika. He called all the other rats [Page242-b+ 65]
<>and organized a secret conference. The subject of
<>discussion was the cruel deeds done by the cat to the
<>rats.
<NI>The next day D2im3d2ika went secretly to examine the
<>ways of living of the cat. The cat ate D2im3d2ika. After
<>40 days the rats came to know that D2im3d2ika was
<>missing. They assembled secretly. They elected a rat
<>named Kokila as their leader. Under his leadership
<>the rats declared independence and left the place. The
<>cat also went his own way finding no means to get food.

<>Vina1yaka1 and S4iva are praised in the introductory stan-

<HI>DI1NANA1THA. A King who lived in Dva1para Age. He
<>was a mighty and famous Vais2n2ava. But his childless
<>life distressed him very much. Once he consulted
<>Ga1lava about his plight. Ga1lava assured him that if he
<>performed a human sacrifice, a son would be born to
<>him. A handsome, scholarly and highly-born man was
<>to be sacrificed into the fire, A cripple, a dark-skinned
<>man or a crude fellow was unsuitable for the purpose.
<>The King's servants scoured the villages and towns
<>looking for such a perfect man, but in vain. At last
<>they reached a country called Das4apura, inhabited by
<>noble Bra1hman2as. The women of that place were
<>reputed for their charming eyes. No man could resist
<>their fascination. In that lovely city there lived a
<>Bra1hman2a named Kr2s2n2adeva with his virtuous wife and
<>three sons. The King's servants requested Kr2s2n2adeva
<>to give one of his sons to be sacrificed. They offered
<>four lakhs of gold coins as price. The Bra1hman2a and
<>his wife cried bitterly and Kr2s2n2adeva offered himself
<>instead of his sons. The royal servants seized one of his
<>sons after throwing gold coins in the house and
<>prepared to take him away. At this stage the second
<>son of Kr2s2n2adeva came forward and volunteered
<>himself. They agreed and he accompanied them to the
<>palace. On their way they met the sage Vis4va1mitra.
<>He asked them to release the boy but they refused to
<>set him free. The sage followed them to the palace and
<>undertook to perform a sacrifice which would bless the
<>King with progeny without a human sacrifice. The
<>King accepted the offer and thus the boy was saved.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 12).
<HI>DI1PAKARN2I. A character in Gun2a1d2hya's Br2hatkatha1.
<>Di1pakarn2i was a King. He had a wife named
<>S4aktimati1. One day while she was sleeping in the gar-
<>den she was bitten by a snake and she died. Distressed
<>by her departure, Di1pakarn2i accepted Brahmacarya.
<>He was deeply grieved because he had no son to
<>succeed to his throne. One day S4iva appeared to him
<>in a dream and told him thus:--“When you pass
<>through the forest, you will come across a youth riding
<>a lion. Take him to your palace; he will be your son.”
<NI>Di1pakarn2i woke up happily. He had faith in his dream.
<>One day he went to a distant forest for hunting.
<>There he saw a very handsome boy riding on a lion.
<>He was reminded of his dream when the boy dismounted [Page243-a+ 62]
<>and the lion walked away slowly to a nearby stream to
<>drink water. At once Di1pakarn2i shot an arrow at the
<>lion. Suddenly the lion gave up its animal shape and
<>transformed itself into a man and spoke to the King as
<>follows:--
<NI>I am a Yaks2a named Sa1ta and a friend of Vais4ravan2a.
<>Once when I went to bathe in the river Gan3ga1, I
<>happened to see a R2s2i virgin and I fell in love with her.
<>I married her according to the Ga1ndharva rules. The
<>R2s2is who came to know of it turned us into a lion
<>couple by their curse. When we fell at their feet and
<>begged pardon, they gave her a blessing that a son
<>would be born to her and that I would fall under your

<NI>After saying this, the Yaks2a vanished. Di1pakarn2i

<HI>DI1RGHATAMAS. A great Muni.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} An3giras, the son of Brahma1, had two sons,
<>Utathya and Br2haspati. One day when Utathya was
<>away from home, Br2haspati approached his elder
<>brother's wife, Mamata1, who was pregnant at the time,
<>and tried to have sexual union with her. But she tried
<>to dissuade him and said--“The child in my womb,
<>born from Utathya's semen has already mastered
<>Vedas and Veda1m3gas. Your semen is also equally
<>powerful. How can my womb bear the combined force
<>of the two semens? So please refrain from this attempt
<>of yours.” But even after hearing these words of his
<>sister-in-law, Br2haspati was not able to control his
<>passions. At the time of the intercourse, when the
<>semen of Br2haspati entered the womb, the child within
<>it cried out--“Father ! this passion is improper. Two
<>persons have no place here. So withdraw your semen.”
<>Br2haspati did not heed the request. The child in the
<>womb repelled the semen that entered the womb with
<>his foot and it dropped on the floor. Br2haspati who
<>became angry, cursed the child. As a result, the boy
<>was born blind. He got the name “Di1rghatamas”
<>because he was born blind. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 104).
<NI>2) {%Family Life.%} In brilliance of parts, Di1rghatamas
<F>1. The story of Brhaspati's union with Mamata1 is given in Bha1gavata Pura1n2a. According to this story the child in her womb was
<>Bharadva1ja. The Maha1bha1rata states that the child born to Mamata1 was Di1rghatamas.</F>
<>equalled Br2haspati. Di1rghatamas, who was born blind,
<>married Pradves2i, a Bra1hman2i1. The couple had many
<>children, chief of whom was Gautama. But after the
<>birth of the children, Di1rghatmas fell into evil ways
<>and became an object of hatred and contempt. The
<>inmates of a1s4ramas dubbed him a sinner. His wife, was
<>disgusted with him. One day, the enraged Di1rgha-
<>tamas, in his fury cursed women as a whole and
<>Pradves2i1 could not control her anger. She, with the
<>help of Gautama and other sons made a raft and
<>placing Di1rghatamas on it, floated it down the river
<>Gan3ga1. The King Bali happened to see the raft float-
<>ing down the river. He sent men to bring the boat to
<>the bank. The King recognized Di1rghatamas and
<>asked the Muni to beget brilliant and intelligent
<>children by his queen. Di1rghatamas agreed and the
<>King sent the queen Sudes2n2a1 to him. The queen who
<>did not find pleasure in the company of the blind and
<>decrepit Muni sent a nurse to him. The nurse bore to
<>him Kaks2i1va1n and ten other sons all of whom became
<>great scholars. After some years the King came to know
<>that the mother of those boys was the nurse. Then he
<>sent Sudes2n2a1 again to the Muni. Di1rghatamas, after
<>touching her body blessed her and five sons, An3ga, [Page244-a+ 65]
<>Van3ga, Kalin3ga, Pun2d2ra and S4un3ga were born to her.
<>They founded five Kingdoms which were known by
<>their names respectively. They are known by their
<>modern names: Bha1galpura, Benga1l, A1ndhra, Ra1ja-
<>sa1hi and Ta1mravika.

<HI>DI1RGHA1YUS. Brother of S4ruta1yus, the King of Kalin3ga.
<>Arjuna killed him in the war. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Verse 29).
<HI>DI1RGHIKA1 A daughter of Vis4vakarman. She was
<>abnormally tall, and since there was the S4a1stric injun-
<>ction that he who married such women would die
<>within six months none came forward to wed her.
<NI>Di1rghika1 began a penance for a good husband. As it
<>continued for years together symptoms of old age began
<>to appear in her. At this juncture an old and ailing
<>householder came there. On certain conditions he
<>married Di1rghika1. After sometime, in obedience to the
<>husband's wisn Di1rghika1 set out on a tour carrying him
<>on her shoulders. Though Ma1n2d2avya cursed her hus-
<>band on their way, due to the chastity of Di1rghika1 the
<>curse proved to be ineffective. The similarity in the
<>stories of S4a1n2d2ili1 and this Di1rghika1 leads us to think
<>that they might have been one and the same person.
<HI>DIS4A1CAKS2U. One of the prominent off-springs of
<>Garud2a. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 10).
<HI>DITI.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A daughter of Daks2a Praja1pati. She was
<>married to Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci. She had many sisters, chief among whom were
<>Aditi, Ka1la1, Dana1yus, Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pr2tha1,
<>Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1, Muni and Kadru1. Kas4yapa's
<>sons by Aditi became Devas (A1diteyas) and his sons
<>by Diti became Asuras (Daityas). (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65).
<NI>2) {%Indra cut Diti's embryo to pieces.%} Devas and Asuras
<>agreed to churn the ocean of milk as a joint endeavour.
<>But when Amr2ta rose up to the surface, they began to
<>quarrel over it. In the battle between Devas and
<>Asuras for the possession of Amr2ta, Diti's sons were
<>killed.
<NI>In her inconsolable grief at the death of her sons, Diti
<>prayed to her husband Kas4yapa that she should be
<>blessed with a brave and heroic son who would be
<>capable of killing Indra. The sage granted her the
<>boon and told her that by worshipping the lord with a
<>pure mind and body for a hundred years, she would
<>bear a son who would be mighty enough to kill Indra.
<>In due course Diti became pregnant and following her
<>husband's advice, she fervently worshipped the Lord
<>and remained pure in mind and body. When Indra
<>came to know that the child in Diti's womb was to be
<>his slayer, he approached her under the disguise of an
<>attendant, offering to serve her. He waited for an [Page244-b+ 65]
<>opportunity to get access to her and before the expiry
<>of a hundred years he got a chance. One day, Diti
<>went to bed without washing her feet and fell asleep.
<>Indra took his Vajra and gaining access to her womb
<>cut the embryo within it into seven pieces. The child
<>in the womb began to cry loudly. Indra asked it
<>“MA1 RUDA” (Do not cry). Then he proceeded to
<>cut each of the seven pieces again into seven and
<>finally there were fortynine pieces in all. They subse-
<>quently became Devas known as “Maruts.” They got
<>the name Maruts because Indra told them “Ma1 Ruda.”
<>All the fortynine Maruts later on became the helpers
<>of Indra. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 21).
<NI>3) {%Diti's sons.%} Asuras were Diti's sons. Chief among
<>them were Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. They had
<>a sister named Sim3hika1. Hiran2yakas4ipu had four
<>sons--Anuhla1da, Hla1da, Prahla1da and Sam3hla1da who
<>were famous for their glory and might. S4u1rapadma,
<>Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura, Gomukha and Aja1mukha
<>were also Diti's sons. Of them, S4u1rapadma had four
<>sons by his wife Mayasuta1, who were Bha1nukopa,
<>Agnimukha, Vajraba1hu and Hiran2ya. An asura named
<>Maha1s4u1ra was born to Sim3havaktra by his wife,
<>Vibhu1ti. The Asuras, S4ambara, S4akuni, Dvimu1rdha1,
<>S4an3ku, As4va, were the sons of Hiran2ya1ks2a. Sim3hika1
<>married Vipracitti; Ra1hu and Ketu were born to them.
<>Sam3hla1da, the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu had three sons,
<>A1yus2ma1n, S4ibi and Ba1s2kala. Virocana was the son of
<>Prahla1da; Maha1bali was the son of Virocana; Ba1n2a
<>was born to Maha1bali and to Ba1n2a were born four
<>crores of Niva1takavacas. All these were the prominent
<>children of Diti. Besides them, Diti had crores of other
<>Asuras born to her. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter
<>3; Harivam3s4a, Chapter 3).
<NI>4) {%Birth of Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a.%} Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>and Hiran2ya1ks2a were the rebirth of Jaya and Vijaya,
<>the two gate-keepers of Maha1vis2n2u. (See under Jaya).
<>There is a story as to how they were born as the sons
<>of Diti.
<NI>Diti was one of the wives of Kas4yapa. She had no
<>children while the other wives of Kas4yapa had children.
<>Jealousy and grief rankled in her mind. One day she
<>approached Kas4yapa and pressed him to beget a son
<>for her. It was the time of dusk when Kas4yapa was
<>deeply absorbed in his day's devotional worship. She
<>disturbed his “Dhya1na” (devotional concentration) by
<>her importunity, but he was reluctant to yield to her
<>wishes at such an inauspicious time. It is at dusk that
<>S4iva goes about with his attendant hordes of spirits,
<>wearing the crown of his matted hair covered with the
<>dust carried by the whirlwinds from cremation grounds
<>and keeping his three eyes wide open. Kas4yapa asked
<>Diti to wait for a few minutes, until that terrible time
<>was over, but she did not heed his advice. In the fury
<>of her passion she sprang towards him and stripped
<>him of his clothes and in the end Kas4yapa yielded to
<>her carnal desires. But after the act he in a repentant
<>mood told her that she had defiled her mind by having
<>sexual union in that unholy hour and by doing so had
<>sinned against the gods. As a result, twin sons will be
<>born in her womb. They would persecute and torture
<>the three worlds. Maha1vis2n2u would incarnate to
<>destroy them. But since she also felt a little regret in
<>her act, a grandson of her (Prahla1da) will become a
<>devotee of Vis2n2u. [Page245-a+ 65]
<>Twin sons, Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a were born
<>to Diti. For the rest of the story, see under Hiran2ya-
<>kas4pu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. (Bha1gavata, Prathama Skan-

<NI>Divoda1sa's great grandfather's father, Ka1s4a had many
<>sons. They were called the Ka1s4is. It was from Ka1s4a's
<>reign that Va1ra1n2asi1 came to be called Ka1s4i1. (Hari
<>Vam3s4a, Chapter 29).
<NI>2) {%Divoda1sa's Reign.%} When Divoda1sa began his rule in
<>Va1ra1n2asi1, there was a Ra1ks2asa named Ks2emaka.
<>Divoda1sa killed him and extended his kingdom. At
<>that stage, Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehayas invaded
<>Divoda1sa. Divoda1sa killed the hundred sons of Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya. At that time the sage Kum3bhaka (Nikumbha)
<>came to Ka1s4i1. His practice was to live fora thousand
<>years at any place where he reached at the time of
<>dusk. Since he had reached Va1ra1n2asi1 at dusk, he set up
<>an a1s4rama and lived there for a thousand years. At
<>that time there was a famine in Va1ra1n2asi1. The whole
<>land was in the grip of a severe drought. Kumbhaka's
<>a1s4rama and its surroundings alone remained green and
<>cool. Herdsmen used to take cattle to graze in the
<>neighbourhood of the a1s4rama. Once when they retur-
<>ned in the evening, they took with their cows, the
<>sacrificial cow of Kumbhaka. It was dark and the sage
<>searched for the cow everywhere but could not trace
<>its whereabouts At last he came to know by intuition
<>that his cow was taken away by the herdsmen. In his
<>rage he cursed that Va1ra1n2asi1 should be ruined and left
<>the place with his disciples. (See under Kumbhaka).
<NI>The story of the ruin of Va1ra1n2asi1 in Harivam3sa is diff-
<>erent. It was the time when S4iva had married Pa1rvati1,
<>the daughter of Himava1n. After marriage S4iva shifted
<>his residence to his wife's house. S4iva whose task was
<>to look after the affairs of the world, was never availa-
<>ble for the purpose at Kaila1sa, his own seat.
<>The gods were in a helpless condition. They ap-
<>proached Pa1rvati1's mother, Mena1 and requested her [Page245-b+ 65]
<>to persuade S4iva to return to his own place by any
<>means. Mena1 called her daughter and ridiculed her
<>husband as a vagabond who had no place to lay his
<>head on. Pa1rvati1 could not bear this insult. Her mother's
<>stinging remarks got circulation in Devaloka. So she
<>urged S4iva to settle down somewhere on earth with her.
<>S4iva agreed and promised to take up residence at
<>Ka1s4i1.
<NI>The ruler of Ka1s4i1 in those days was Divoda1sa. It was
<>a prosperous period in the country. As a rule, man
<>turns to God only when faced with misfortunes. So
<>S4iva decided to bring about a famine among the people
<>of the country by ruining it. For that he sent sage
<>Kumbhaka to Va1ra1n2asi1. Kumbhaka arrived in Ka1s4i1
<>and appeared to the barber Karn2aka to whom he
<>communicated S4iva's intentions. The barber cheerfully
<>fell in with the proposal and built a temple on the
<>next day for the residence of Kumbhaka. Living in
<>the temple, Kumbhaka began to participate in the
<>spiritual matters of the people. His blessings were much
<>sought after and people came to have deep faith in
<>him.
<NI>Divoda1sa had no children. He had made many pious
<>offerings to gods and performed many holy rites for
<>removing his wife's sterility, but it was all in vain.
<>At last, at the King's suggestion, she began to offer
<>pu1ja1 to Kumbhaka praying for issue. But even after
<>a long period of devoted worship, she received no
<>blessing or boon from the sage. Moved by the pathetic
<>condition of his queen, Suyas4as, Divoda1sa reproached
<>Kumbhaka very severely. He reprimanded him for
<>denying his blessings to the queen while he was shower-
<>ing them on all and sundry in the country. Provoked
<>at the King's rebuke, Kumbhaka pronounced a curse
<>that the country should be ruined. As a result of it the
<>country began to decline. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter 29).
<NI>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 came and settled down in Va1ra1n2asi1.
<>After some years, Pa1rvati1 began to press her husband
<>to leave the place and to go somewhere else. S4iva was
<>not inclined to do so. He said the place was “Avimu-
<>kta” and therefore insisted that he would not leave
<>it. From that time the place came to be called
<>“Avimukta.”
<NI>3) Other details.
<NI>(1) Towards the end of his life Divoda1sa became a
<>Ra1jars2i (Royal Saint). There are numerous references
<>to this Ra1jars2i in the R2gveda. Since Divoda1sa was of
<>a very hospitable nature he was known by another
<>name, “Atithigva”. In R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 16th
<>Anuva1ka, 127th Su1kta, we read that once he hid him-
<>self under water to escape from an Asura called
<>S4am3bara.
<NI>(2) Divoda1sa had a son named “Parucchepa”, who
<>was a R2s2i. R2gveda 1st Man2d2ala 19th Anuva1ka, 127th
<>Su1kta relates to Parucchepa.
<NI>(3) Bhi1maratha, the father of Divoda1sa, had two other
<>names, Bhi1masena, and Sudeva. Divoda1sa purchased
<>Ma1dhavi1, the daughter of Yaya1ti after paying two
<>hundred S4ya1makarn2a1s4vas (beautiful horses with dark-
<>coloured ears) to Ga1lava, so that he might have chil-
<>dren. After the birth of his children, he returned
<>Ma1dhavi1 to her father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>117).
<NI>(4) He sits in Yama's assembly and offers Pu1ja1 to
<>Yama. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 12). [Page246-a+ 65]
<NI>(5) Divoda1sa once plundered the accessories of his
<>enemies. Agnihotra vanished after it. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 21).
<NI>(6) It was at the behest of Indra that Divoda1sa built
<>the city of Va1ran2asi1 (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>30, Verse 16).
<NI>(7) Once Divoda1sa fought with the King of Hehaya
<>for one thousand days. After having lost his army he went
<>to the sage Bharadva1ja and performed Putraka1mes2t2i
<>sacrifice. As a result of it a son Pratardana was born
<>to him. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>(8) Other names for Divoda1sa used in the Maha1bha1-
<>rata are--Bhaimaseni, Ka1s4i1s4a, Saudeva, Sudevatanaya
<>etc.
<NI>DIVYA1DEVI1. Daughter of Divoda1sa, King of Plaks2a-
<>dvi1pa. There is a story about this princess in Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapters 85, 88.
<NI>Divoda1sa decided to give his daughter Divya1 in
<>marriage to Citrasena, King of Ru1pades4a. But just
<>before the day fixed for the marriage Citrasena died
<>prematurely. So, as advised by the Bra1hman2as who had
<>come there she was married to Ru1pasena. He also died
<>soon after. She was subsequently married to 21 persons
<>in turn, and all of them died one by one.
<NI>Everyone took pity on her for her ill-fate. At last, at the
<>suggestion of the ministers, preparations were made for
<>her svayam3vara. Here also ill-luck pursued her. All
<>the princes who arrived to take part in the svayam3vara
<>killed each other in mutual fight. Depressed and embit-
<>tered by all this, Divya1 decided torenounce all worldly
<>pleasures and proceeded to the forest.
<NI>Once S4uka named Ujjvala came to Plaks2advi1pa.
<>Moved to pity at the grief-stricken Divya1 he taught her
<>“As4u1nyas4ayana” vrata. When she practised this vrata
<>with devotion for about four years, Maha1vis2n2u appeared

<HI>DIVYAVARS2A(M). 365 days make one year for hu-
<>man beings. One year for human beings is one day for
<>the gods. 365 such days of the gods make one year for
<>the gods. This means that 365 years for human beings
<>are equal to one year for the gods. The year for the
<>gods is known as “Divyavarsa” or “Divyavatsara”.
<>Kr2tayuga is made up of 4,800 Divyavatsaras. Treta1yu-
<>uga has 3,600 Divyavatsaras. 2,400 Divyavatsaras make
<>up one Dva1parayuga. Kaliyuga has 1,200 Divyavatsaras.
<>12,000 Divyavars2as of this kind make up one “catur-

<>After the end of the period of one Manu, the gods
<>complete their term of existence. The total period of
<>14 Manus is called a Kalpa. At the end of every
<>Kalpa there is a deluge. One Kalpa is one day time
<>for Brahma1. After the deluge, until the time of one
<>Kalpa, is Brahma1's night. There is no universe at that
<>time. At the end of that Kalpa, the next Kalpa
<>begins and Brahma1 starts his work of creation.
<>In this way when 360 days and nights of Brahma1
<>are completed, it is one Brahma1 Vars2a. One Brahma1
<>life-span is 120 such years. After that there is nothing [Page246-b+ 64]
<>for a Brahma1's life-span. Then Brahma1 is re-born and
<>resumes creation. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama Skandha).
<HI>DRAUPADI1. Pa1n5ca1li1, the wife of the Pa1n2d2avas. (See
<>under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<HI>DRAUPADI1HARAN2A PARVA. A sub section of Vana
<>Parva in the Maha1bha1rata. This covers Chapters 262
<>to 271 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAUPADI1SATYABHA1MA1SAM3VA1DA PARVA. A
<>sub section of Vana Parva, in the Maha1bha1rata. This
<>comprises Chapters 233 to 235 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAVID2A I. A King of the family of Priyavrata who
<>was the son of Manu. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<HI>DRAVID2A II. A gandharva who was the father of
<>Kam3sa. (See under Kam3sa) Am3s4umati1 was the daugh-
<>ter of this gandharva. (See under Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DRAVID2A(M). (DRA1VID2A). In ancient days the
<>whole of South India was known by the name Tami-
<>laka, as Tamil was the language used throughout South
<>India. Strictly speaking, all the languages used in
<>South India were given the name Tamil. The word
<>‘Tamil’ underwent changes in the language of North
<>India and took the form ‘Dra1vida’. Etymologists are
<>of opinion that the changes that took place in the word
<>Tamil were are follows:- Tamil--Damil--Damid2-
<>-Dramid2--Dravid2--Dra1vid2. Reference to the
<>Dra1vid2a country occurs in most of the Pura1n2as.
<>Maha1bha1rata states that Sahadeva, one of the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas, sent a note for collecting taxes from the people of
<>Dra1vida. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 71.
<NI>“There are other countries also in the southern Bha1rata
<>such as Dravida, Kerala, Pra1cya, Mu1s2i1ka, Vanava1si1ka
<>Karn2a1t2aka, Mahis2aka, Vikalpa and Mu1s2aka.” This
<>statement (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9) throws
<>light on the various countries which existed in South
<>India at the time of Maha1bha1rata. In Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10, it is mentioned that Kam3sa, the uncle of
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, was the son of Dramila, a gandharva. (See
<>under Kam3sa).
<HI>DRA1VIDAS. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 22) that the dra1vidas were
<>originally Ks2atriyas and that they became S4u1dras by
<>the curse of Bra1hman2as.
<HI>DRA1VID2A BHA1S2A1. (Dravidian Language). Linguists
<>have classified the languages of the world under certain
<>groups. Important among them are the Indo-European
<>group, the semitic group, the Hamitic group, the Ural
<>Altaic group, the South East Asiatic group, the Dravi-
<>dian group, Austric group, the Bantu group and the
<>Chinese group.
<NI>Almost all the languages in South India belong to the
<>Dravidian group. The languages of this group are
<>Tamil, Telugu, Kannad2a, Malaya1lam, Tulu, Kut2aku,
<>Tot2a, Kot2a, Bad2aka, Kuruk and Bra1hu1i1. Of these
<>Bra1hu1i1 alone is used in the mountain regions of Balu-
<>cisthan. Linguists like Smi1mud and others have stated
<>that there is a close relation between the Australian and
<>Dravidian languages. The A1ryan language has influence-
<>ed the Dravidian languages to a great extent. But Tamil
<>has not been so much influenced as Telugu, Kannad2a
<>and Malaya1lam. It is because Tamil had a great wealth
<>of literature of its own from ancient times.
<>The Dravidian group is again divided into four sections:
<>Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern. Bra1hu1i1
<>is the only language in the Northern section. Its Ety- [Page247-a+ 64]
<>mology, grammar etc. are like that of the Dravidian
<>group. But it had been influenced to a large extent by
<>the Iranian language. Still it keeps its Dravidian cha-
<>racter.
<NI>Telugu, Gon2d2i, Kuruk, Kola1mi, Ma1lt2a etc. come under
<>the Eastern group. Of these only Telugu has grown as
<>a literary language. Telugu is in use from Madras to
<>Mahendragiri. But it has various sub-divisions and local
<>differences. The Telugu used in the Districts of Kr2s2n2a1
<>and Goda1vari1 is considered to be the purest form.
<>Golari, Sa1leva1ri, Ka1ma1ri, Va1sari, Da1sari etc. are its local
<>sub-divisions. Over modern Telugu, Sanskrit has its
<>full sway.
<NI>Kannad2a, Kut2aku, Tot2a, Kod2a, etc. come under the
<>western group. Kannad2a is used in Mysore and the
<>vicinity of the Districts of Coimbatore, Salem, Bellary,
<>Anantapore etc. Bad2aka used in the Nilgiris, Kurumpa,
<>used in the vicinity of Nilgiris, Kut2aku used in
<>Coorg, are the sub divisions of Kannad2a. In edicts from
<>the 5th century Kannad2a could be seen in its ancient
<>form. The modern Kannad2a has been used from 16th
<>century onwards. Tulu is in use in places between the
<>rivers Candragiri in the south of. Southern Canara and
<>Kalya1n2apuri1. Only a few ancient songs could be includ-
<>ed in Tulu literature. The Malaya1lam script is used
<>to write Tulu. But now certain books in Tulu have
<>been published using Kannad2a script.
<NI>Tamil and Malaya1lam are the languages of the Sou-
<>thern section. The oldest literature in the Dravidian
<>group is in Tamil. The most ancient form of Tamil
<>is seen in the edicts and stone tables of the 30th century
<>B.C. The most important among them are the San3ga
<>works. The grammatical work ‘Tolka1ppiyam, is the
<>literary grammar of Centamil. Malaya1lam became an
<>independent language only by the 8th century A.D. The
<>close relation that exists between Tamil and Malaya1lam
<>is not visible in any other language of the Dravidian
<>group. By examining the inter-relations of the various
<>languages in the Dravidian group, and noting
<>how close or distant the relation is, we can ascertain
<>which languages separated themselves first from the
<>original Dravida language.
<HI>DRAVIN2ASA. A Pracetas. (One of the ten sons of the
<>Pra1ci1na Barhis). (Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>DRAVIRATHA. A King of the family of An3ga. He was
<>the son of Dadhiva1hana and the father of Dharmaratha
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 277).
<HI>DRAVYAS4UDDHI. Purifying impure things, The
<>mode of purification of impure things, in ancient
<>India, was known as dravyas4uddhi. The procedure of
<>purification was as follows:
<NI>If earthern-wares became impure by coming into con-
<>tact with urine or excreta, they should be burnt in fire.
<>Golden or copper vessels may be remoulded or filled
<>with or dipped in tamarind water. Things made of
<>iron or bronze may be washed in ash-water. Things
<>made of glass or pearl need only be washed in pure
<>water. Things born in water such as lotus etc. could
<>be purified by dipping them in water. If cloth is made
<>impure rub it with soil and dip it in water. If it is a
<>large quantity of cloth, a mixture of soil and water may
<>be sprinkled on it. Wooden things will become pure
<>by planing. Cot, chair, fan, cart etc. need only be
<>washed. Pots used for cooking meat may be touched [Page247-b+ 64]
<>with cow's milk. Things made of ivory may be washed
<>in mustard-water. Jaggery, salt etc. need only be dried.

<HI>DRON2A I. The teacher in archery of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>the Kauravas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Dron2a was the son of Bharadva1ja who had his
<>hermitage erected on the bank of the Ganges. Once
<>Bharadva1ja went to bathe in the river. When he got
<>into the river he saw the celestial maid Ghr2ta1ci1. The cele-
<>stial maid ran away as soon as she saw the hermit. But
<>her cloth was caught in grass and slipped off her body.
<>When the hermit saw the complete form of her body
<>which was bright and beautiful, he had seminal discharge.
<>The discharged semen was kept in a Dron2a (trough).
<>A child was born from that and he was named
<>Dron2a, who was brought up in the hermitage. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 13).
<NI>2) {%Education and Marriage.%} Dron2a learned the art of
<>using weapons from his father and the hermit Agnives4a.
<>Drupada the prince of Pa1n5ca1la was the fellow student
<>of Dron2a. They became great friends. On completion
<>of education Drupada returned to Pa1n5ca1la. Dron2a
<>married Kr2pi1 the daughter of S4aradva1n. A son was born
<>to them. At his birth the child neighed like the horse
<>Uccaih2s4ravas; so his parents named him As4vattha1ma1.
<>Hearing that Paras ura1ma was giving Bra1hman2as free
<>gift of wealth and property, Dron2a reached there.
<>Dron2a's desire was to get Dhanurveda (the art of
<>archery). Dron2a with his disciples went to Mahendra-
<>giri and saw Paras4ura1ma, who was about to enter forest
<>giving away everything he had. Paras4ura1ma said, “I
<>have given away to the Bra1hman2as gold and everything
<>I had. The land I had conquered is given to Kas4yapa.
<>Now there remains only my body and some weapons.
<>You can have one of them.”
<NI>Dron2a preferred the weapons. Thus Dron2a got the
<>entire armoury of Paras4ura1ma. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 13).
<NI>3) {%He became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas.%}
<>After receiving dhanurveda from Paras4ura1ma Dron2a
<>went to Pa1n5ca1la. Drupada who had been a fellow
<>student of Dron2a was the King of Uttarapan5ca1la. then.
<>Though Dron2a had become proficient in archery, he
<>was very poor.
<NI>He had no money even to buy milk for his child. Once
<>the playmates of As4vattha1ma1 made him drink a mix-
<>ture of water and flour saying that it was milk. So
<>Dron2a approached Drupada for financial help. But
<>Drupada shunned his fellow student, scolded him and
<>sent him away without giving any help. Dron2a vowed
<>that he would, somehow or other, take revenge upon
<>Drupada and departed from Pa1n5ca1la.
<NI>The aim of Dron2a was to get some capable disciples. He
<>reached Hastina1pura and stayed in disguise with Gautama
<>for a while. Once the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas who
<>were boys were engaged in the game of Ka1ra (a kind
<>of cricket play) outside the palace premises. The ball
<>fell in a well by chance. The princess stood round the
<>well and began to ponder how to get the ‘ball’ out of
<>the well. They tried all means but in vain. At that
<>time a Bra1hman2a of dark complexion, short and aged,
<>came by that way. It was Dron2a. The boys gathered
<>round the old man. Dron2a threw his ring also into the
<F>1. To take revenge on Drupada was the thought that was uppermost in the mind of Dron2a.</F> [Page248-b+ 64]
<>well and said: “Your kingly qualities are very poor.
<>Your education in using weapons is not complete. If
<>you give me a meal I will get both the ring and the
<>ball together” The boys agreed to the conditions.
<>Dron2a took a grass and evoked arrow into it by mantra
<>(spell) and shot it at the ‘Ka1ra’. The next grass was
<>shot at the first grass. It struck the first grass. Thus he
<>shot grasses one after another till the grass reached the
<>brink of the well and by pulling the grass he took the ball
<>out. In the same way he took the ring also out of the
<>well. When they got the ‘Ka1ra’ the boys stood round
<>Dron2a and asked him what he would like as the reward
<>for his deed. Dron2a said that they need only tell Bhi1s2ma
<>how a short man of dark complexion took the ball out of
<>the well. Accordingly the boys went to Bhi1s2ma and
<>told him everything. Immediately Bhi1s2ma understood
<>that it was Dron2a. Bhi1s2ma thought that Dron2a was the
<>best person to teach the princes. So Dron2a was brought to
<>the palace and was engaged as the teacher in archery.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 130 and 131).
<NI>4) {%Education in Archery of the Kauravas and reward.%}
<NI>(a) {%First vow.%} Dron2a asked the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kau-
<>ravas to sit together and then told them. “There is one
<>thing that you should do for me when your education
<>is over”. Hearing this they all kept silent. But Arjuna
<>came forward and took the vow that he would achieve
<>that task according to the wish of the teacher.
<NI>{%(b) The disciple who is second to none.%} The training in
<>weapons commenced. Hearing of the fame of Dron2a,
<>disciples came from places far and near. Arjuna was
<>the first of all the students. Sending all the students to
<>fetch water Dron2a taught his son As4vattha1ma1 certain
<>special lessons. Arjuna secretly knew this. So he
<>brought water as quickly as possible before the others.
<>As Dron2a loved his brilliant student Arjuna, he taught
<>both his son and Arjuna alike the secrets. Seeing the
<>brilliance of Arjuna Dron2a ordered the cook not to seat
<>Arjuna in a dark place for meals. Yet it happened once
<>that the light was extinguished by wind while the prin-
<>ces were having their meals. All sat still, without eating,
<>while Arjuna alone ate his food. From this Arjuna
<>discovered that without seeing the object one could hit
<>the target by constant practice. Dron2a was greatly
<>pleased at this and embracing him promised to try to
<>make him such an expert that there would be none
<>equal to him in archery.
<NI>{%(c) Ekalavya.%} Once Arjuna and the other disciples went
<>to the forest for a hunt and there they met Ekalavya
<>who was superior to Arjuna in archery. This Ekalavya
<>had once approached Dron2a to learn archery from him.
<>But it was against the rule for a Brahmin to teach a
<>forester the art of fighting. So Ekalavya returned to the
<>forest and making an earthen image of Dron2a worshipp-
<>ed it and began self-learning in archery. Now he had
<>become superior to Arjuna in archery. The teacher
<>had said that none would be equal to Arjuna in archery.
<>Arjuna told Dron2a about Ekalavya. The teacher went
<>to the forest and got the thumb of Ekalavya as the
<>reward due to the teacher. Since then Ekalavya became
<>a great archer though only of a lower level than Arjuna
<>(See under Ekalavya).
<NI>{%d) Expert disciple.%} The education in archery and the
<>use of weapons was nearing completion. In archery
<>Arjuna was second to none. Duryodhana and Bhi1ma [Page249-a+ 65]
<>became expert club-men. As4vattha1ma1 was the first in
<>the secrets of archery. Nakula and Sahadeva became
<>expert swordsmen. Arjuna was expert in all branches of
<>weapon-training. Bhi1ma had bodily strength and Arjuna
<>had the strength of learning. Yudhis2t2hira was the fore-
<>most in chariot-fighting.
<NI>e) {%Artificial bird.%} Once Dron2a placed an artificial bird
<>on the branch of a tree without the knowledge of the
<>princes, to test their practice in archery. Then he
<>placed his disciples with their bows, around the tree,
<>and told them to shoot the bird down at his command.
<>Dron2a first called Dharmaputra and told him to look
<>at the bird. Then he asked him what he saw. Dharma-
<>putra said that he saw the bird, the tree, the teacher
<>and the students. He tested one by one. All gave the
<>same reply, that Dharmaputra gave. At last he asked
<>Arjuna. Arjuna stood for a while, taking aim and said
<>that he saw a bird only. The teacher commanded to
<>shoot and Arjuna sent an arrow. At the first shot the bird
<>fell down headless. With this test Dron2a understood that
<>Arjuna could defeat Drupada and embraced his
<>disciple.
<NI>{%(f) Dron2a caught by a crocodile.%} Once Dron2a and his
<>disciples went to bathe in the Ganges. While they were
<>dipping and splashing in the water a crocodile caught
<>Dron2a by the leg. Dron2a was unable to extricate
<>himself from the grip of the crocodile. So he asked his
<>disciples to shoot the crocodile and kill it. All stood
<>agape. Arjuna at once took bow and arrows and sent
<>five arrows one after another at the crocodile, which
<>died instantly and came afloat. The teacher, who
<>was much pleased, got out of the water and embraced
<>Arjuna and taught him ‘Brahma S4ira1stra’, a divine
<>weapon. After imparting this knowledge Dron2a told
<>Arjuna not to operate this weapon on man. But if an
<>enemy superior to man attacked him, then only, he
<>should send this missile at him to kill him.
<NI>Giving due respect to the advice of the teacher, Arjuna
<>received the Brahmas4ira1stra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 133).
<NI>g) {%Demonstration by the pupils.%} When the training of the prin-
<>ces terminated, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accorded sanction to hold a
<>demonstration of weapon-play, by the princes. An
<>arena was got ready. Dron2a entered the arena. As a
<>preliminary rite Dron2a worshipped the gods. Then he
<>invited Bra1hman2as to bless his pupils. After that the
<>pupils gave the teacher, gold, precious stones, cloths,
<>and other costly things. The princes paid homage to
<>to their teacher. The teacher gave his blessings to
<>them. With this the demonstration commenced.
<>Clubbing between Duryodhana and Bhi1ma was a
<>terrible one. But the mock fighting changed to a seri-
<>ous fight. Dron2a sent As4vattha1ma1 who separated them.
<>The audience applauded their performance. The per-
<>formance of Arjuna was of the most superior type and
<>the audience and the teacher were struck with wonder
<>at his extraordinary capability. Karn2a also showed
<>his performance. (For details see under Arjuna, Para 1
<>and Karn2a, Para 4). (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 133
<>and 134).
<NI>5) {%Revenge upon Drupada.%} When demonstration came to
<>an end it was the time for giving the teacher the gift
<>due to him. The teacher had, at the beginning, told
<>his pupils that on completion of the training they should
<>give him a gift. Accordingly he demanded that Drupada, [Page249-b+ 65]
<>the King of Pa1n5ca1la, should be brought before him with
<>his hands tied. As soon as Duryodhana and Karn2a heard
<>this they rapidly marched to Pa1n5ca1la and engaged
<>Drupada in a fight but were defeated by Drupada. After
<>that Arjuna entered the battle-field, defeated and tied
<>Drupada and brought him before Dron2a who was kind
<>enough not to kill Drupada. The Kingdom of Pa1n5ca1la
<>was divided into two. Drupada was given Uttara-Pa1n5-
<>ca1la and Dron2a took Daks2in2a Pa1n5ca1la. Then Drupada
<>was released. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 137).
<NI>6) {%Arjuna is accorded sanction to fight with his teacher.%} One
<>year after the revenge on Drupada Yudhis2t2hira was
<>anointed as heir-apparent, by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Once, in
<>the council of the king, Dron2a called Arjuna to him and
<>said: “Oh, Arjuna! you must take an oath to do a parti-
<>cular thing in the presence of your relatives. If it happens
<>that I oppose you in battle you should fight against me
<>without thinking that I am your teacher. This oath is
<>your gift to your teacher.” Arjuna agreed and took the
<>oath in the presence of the people. Because there was such
<>an oath Arjuna's conscience did not prick him when he
<>had to fight against his teacher Dron2a in the battle of
<>Bha1rata between the Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 139).
<NI>7) {%Part played by Dron2a up to the battle of Bha1rata.%}
<>(1) Duryodhana and his party came to know only at
<>the time of the svayam3vara (marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li1 that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas were not killed in the lac house burning.
<>When Arjuna won the test and got Pa1n5ca1li1, the Kaura-
<>vas became furious and began to plot against the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. At that time Dron2a came to the council-hall
<>of the Kauravas and said that the Kauravas should go
<>to Pa1n5ca1la and greet the Pa1n2d2avas, bring them back
<>and give them half of the kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 203).
<NI>(2) Dron2a was present at the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(imperial consecration) performed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza 8).
<NI>(3) When the game of dice was going on between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira Dron2a came with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>to the place to witness the game. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 60, Stanza 2).
<NI>(4) Dron2a declared that the game of dice between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira was not fair (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 2).
<NI>(5) Dron2a was well-versed in archery. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 4).
<NI>(6) While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the country of
<>Vira1t2a, Arjuna in the guise of Br2hannala, fought with the
<>Kauravas. Dron2a was the first to recognize Br2hannala
<>as Arjuna at the sound of his conch. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 24).
<NI>(7) In that fight Dron2a fought with Arjuna whose
<>arrows wounded Dron2a and he ran away from the
<>battlefield. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(8) When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to the council-hall of the
<>Kauravas to plead for a treaty on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>who had returned after forest life and pseudonymity,
<>Dron2a took the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and argued with

<>heart Dron2a was on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas. But he
<>fought against them, taking the side of the Kauravas.
<>Even at that time he ardently wished the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>win the battle. What is the reason for it? An answer to
<>this question is found in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 43.
<NI>The battle was about to begin. Dharmaputra went to
<>Dron2a and bowed before him and requested to bless
<>him so that he might win the battle against the Kaura-
<>vas. Dron2a said, “It is good on your part to have
<>come and seen me before the battle is begun. If you
<>had not seen me I would have cursed you to lose the
<>battle. But today I am honoured since you have come.
<>You fight the battle. Victory is yours. But I have to
<>stand with the Kauravas, and there is a reason for it.
<>Man is a slave of money and money is not the slave
<>of Man. The Kauravas have tied me with money. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a will be on the side of the righteous. Where S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a is, there will be victory. But so long as I fight
<>it is difficult for you to win. So try to kill me at the
<>beginning of the battle. You need not feel sorry for
<>killing your teacher. Because when I shower arrows
<>and fight vehemently I won't look to see which enemy
<>has struck me down. Enemies could kill me only when
<>I am lying on darbha grass leaving fighting in dis-
<>appointment. I will put down my weapons in battle
<>only when I hear words which I dislike to hear.”

<>(Drupada).
<NI>2) {%Education and kingship.%} Yajn5asena went to the hermi-
<>tage of Bharadva1ja for education. Dron2a, who became
<>a great teacher in archery later, was also a student and
<>disciple of Bharadva1ja at that time. Thus during the
<>time of education both Drupada and Dron2a became
<>fast friends. After receiving education Drupada re-
<>turned to his country. At that time Pa1n5ca1la was ruled
<>by Pr2s2ata. When Yajn5asena returned on completion of
<>his education, Pr2s2ata died and Yajn5asena was anointed
<>as King of Uttara-Pa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 129).
<NI>3) {%Yajn5asena reproaches Dron2a.%} It has already been said
<>that during the period of education Dron2a and Yajn5a-
<>sena were fast friends. Once Drupada said to Dron2a:
<>“My dear friend. My father has told me that I would
<>be made the King of Uttara Pa1n5ca1la on completing my
<>education. Thus if I become a King, the treasury of the
<>King will be at your disposal.”
<NI>After the education both returned to their places. Not
<>much later Dron2a got married. A son born to him was
<>named As4vattha1ma1. Dron2a was so poor that he could
<>not even buy milk for his child. Once the friends of
<>As4vattha1ma1 mixed flour in water and made him drink
<>it saying that it was milk. As4vattha1ma1 drank it without
<>knowing that it was not milk. Thinking that he had
<>become energetic by drinking milk he began to run
<>with the other boys. At last they told him the truth
<>and teased him.
<NI>With his wife and child Dron2a went to Drupada who
<>did not care to recognize him as a friend. Dron2a tried
<>to remind him of their former friendship. But Drupada
<>shunned him and said, “If I had friendship with you,
<>it was to achieve certain ends. There is no friendship
<>between the rich and the poor, the learned and the
<>illiterate, the brave and the coward. So if there was
<>any friendship at all it was not real. You, who are slow
<>of brain! Kings of high status cannot have friendship
<>with such people especially the poor. A Brahmin
<>learned in Vedas won't befriend a Brahmin who is not
<>learned in Vedas, a man seated in a chariot cannot
<>befriend a man who is not seated in a chariot and a
<>King cannot befriend one who is not a King. So a
<>friendship of bygone days is no friendship at all”.
<NI>Drupada's reproaches aroused a storm of anger in
<>Dron2a. He vowed that he would avenge the insult.
<>With his wife and child he got out of the palace. He [Page252-a+ 65]
<>wandered about in search of disciples who were capable
<>of confronting with Drupada. At last he came to
<>Hastina1pura and became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130).
<NI>4) {%The revenge of Dron2a.%} Dron2a told Bhi1s2ma about his
<>dealings with Drupada. Bhi1s2ma consoled Dron2a. Before
<>the commencement of the training in archery, Dron2a
<>told his disciples: “When your training in archery is
<>completed you will have to do a favour to your tea-
<>cher”. All stood agape. But Arjuna came forward and
<>said: “I will do”. Dron2a embraced Arjuna. The train-
<>ing commenced. The Andhakas, Vr2s2n2is and others
<>joined his school of archery.
<NI>The training in archery came to an end. Dron2a called
<>his disciples and told them that Drupada should be
<>tied with a rope and placed before him. When they
<>heard the words of the teacher, Duryodhana, Karn2a, Yu-
<>yutsu, Dus4s4a1sana, Vikarn2a, Jara1sandha and Sulocana led
<>the Kauravas to Pa1n5ca1la. Arjuna knew that the
<>Kauravas would not be able to defeat Drupada. He
<>told the teacher that when the Kauravas returned
<>without achieving the task, he himself would go and
<>bring Drupada. After a terrible battle the Kauravas
<>were defeated by the Pa1n5ca1las. After that Arjuna con-
<>fronted Drupada. Nakula and Sahadeva stood as
<>guards of the wheels. Bhi1masena with his club stood
<>in front of the army. Arjuna drove the chariot right
<>in the midst of the Pa1n5ca1la army. Bhi1ma took his club
<>and a terrible battle ensued. Arjuna shattered the
<>Pa1n5ca1la army, bound Drupada and took him to Dron2a.
<>The teacher looked at Drupada and reproached him
<>with scornful word: “I have destroyed your country.
<>Now you are at my mercy. Is not the former friendship
<>a friendship?” Drupada requested that they should be
<>friends in future. Accordingly Drupada was set free.
<>The country of Pa1n5ca1la was divided into two, and
<>giving Uttara Pa1n5ca1la to Drupada, Dron2a took Daks2in2a
<>Pa1n5ca1la. Thus because of the revenge of Dron2a, Dru-
<>pada lost half of his kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 137).
<NI>5) {%Birth of Children.%} Though Dron2a and Drupada
<>were on friendly terms Drupada did not forget the
<>defeat he had incurred at the hands of Dron2a. So,
<>Drupada desired to have a son who would become
<>powerful enough to take revenge on Dron2a. He began
<>to think of ways and means. He consulted several
<>learned Brahmins. At that time two hermit brothers
<>ya1ja and Upaya1ja lived on the bank of the Ganges.
<>The King approached them and requested their help to
<>obtain a son, who would kill Dron2a, and promised to
<>give them cows and other precious things in return.
<>At first they refused to help him. The King served
<>Upaya1ja for a year, and pleased him. He sent the King
<>to the hermitage of Ya1ja. They accepted the request
<>of the King. Both the hermits performed a sacrifice
<>for Drupada. A boy and a girl arose from the sacrifi-
<>cial fire. The boy was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna and the
<>girl was named Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1). There was a celes-
<>tial voice that the boy would kill Dron2a when he grew
<>up. (M.B. A1di parva, Chapter 167).
<NI>6) {%The marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 grew up. Drupada
<>desired to give her in marriage to Arjuna. But at that
<>time the lac-house caught fire and the Pa1n2d2avas disap-
<>peared. Drupada set certain tests in the Svayam3vara
<>of Pa1n5ca1li1 with a view to ascertain if Arjuna was alive. [Page252-b+ 65]
<>The Pa1n2d2avas came to the svayam3vara and Drupada
<>found out Arjuna. But Drupada did not like the idea
<>of his daughter becoming the wife of more than one
<>husband. Then Vya1sa appeared there and informed
<>Drupada of the previous births of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. Drupada was much pleased and he gave the
<>Pa1n2d2avas a good deal of wealth and sent Pa1n5ca1li1 with
<>them. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 196).

<>by his father because he did not comply with the re-
<>quest of his father to exchange his old age with the
<>youth of his son. The curse was that his desires
<>would not be realized, that he would stay in places
<>where he would not like to stay that his kingdom would
<>be lost and that he would be called Bhoja. (See under
<>Yaya1ti).
<HI>DRUHYU II. A son of Matina1ra, a King of the Pu1ru
<>dynasty. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Stanza 14).
<HI>DUH2KHA(M). Agni Pura1n2a tells the following about
<>the origin of Duh2kham.
<NI>Him3sa1 (violence) is the wife of Adharma (unrighteous-
<>ness). To the couple were born two daughters called
<>Anr2ta (falsehood) and Nikr2ta (fraud) and from them
<>were born the daughters Bhaya1 (fear) Naraka (hell)
<>Ma1ya1 (illusion) and Vedana1 (pain). Ma1ya1 brought
<>forth Mr2tyu (death), the annihilator of all living
<>objects, and Vedana1, from Raurava (a particular hell)
<>brought forth Duh2kha (sorrow, grief). From Mr2tyu
<>were born Ja1ti (caste), Jara1 (wrinkles), S4oka (sorrow),
<>Tr2s2n2a1 (covetouseness) and Krodha (anger). (Agni Pu-
<>ra1n2a, Chapter 19).
<HI>DULIDUHA. A King in ancient India. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verse 233).
<HI>D2UM2D2UBHA. A snake. Sage Sahasrapa1da became the
<>snake as a result of a curse. For details see under
<>Sahasrapa1da.
<HI>DUNDUBHI I. A terrible asura, son of Maya and
<>brother of Ma1ya1vi1.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Da1navas were the offsprings of Kas4yapa,
<>grandson of Brahma1 and son of Mari1ci by his wife
<>Danu, daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. Maya, chief among
<>the Da1navas earned great reputation as a unique archi
<>tect. Once Maya attended a dance programme in
<>devaloka where he fell in love with Hema1 dancing with
<>the deva-women. When the dance was over Maya told
<>Hema1 about his love for her. Hema1 too had fallen in
<>love with Maya. And they left the place in secret and
<>reached the southern slope of the Hima1layas where they
<>built a beautiful city called Hemapura and they lived
<>there. Ere long they-had two sons, Dundubhi and
<>Ma1ya1vi1, both of them equally distinguished in prowess.
<>Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Dundubhi's relati nship with Ra1van2a.%} Maya did tapas
<>for a daughter in the western plains of Mount Kaila1sa.
<>One of those days Pa1rvati1 went out of Kaila1sa to feed
<>brahmins in celebration of the birthday of Subrah-
<>man2ya. In the absence of Pa1rvati1 a deva woman called
<>Madhura1 who had observed the Somava1ravrata came
<>to Kaila1sa to salute Maha1deva (S4iva) who enjoyed her
<>for some time. On her return to S4iva Pa1rvati1 noticed
<>ashes worn by him transferred to the breasts of
<>Madhura1. Drawing the natural inference from this
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and cursed Madhura1 to be transform- [Page253-b+ 65]
<>ed into a frog. Then S4iva blessed her that she would
<>regain her former self after twelve years and have a
<>heroic husband. Madhura1 who was thus turned into a
<>frog fell into a well close to where Maya was engaged
<>in tapas. And, after twelve years, the frog regained its
<>former form and became Madhura1 again. Maya, who
<>saw her adopted her as daughter and brought her up as
<>such calling her Mandodari1. Mandodari1 became Ra1v-
<>an2a’ wife and thus Dundubhi became the brother-in-law
<>of Ra1van2a.
<NI>3) {%Dundubhi grew up.%} The following is told about Dun-
<>dubhi in Canto 11, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a.
<NI>As beautiful and majestic as the peak of Mount Kaila1sa,
<>the heroic Dundubhi possessed the form of the buffalo.
<>And, he had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<>Proud and haughty over his own prowess and losing his
<>head over the boon he had received from God, Dundu-
<>bhi went to fight with the ocean, the lord of rivers. (It
<>was S4iva who gave him boons. See M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 11).
<NI>4) {%Fight with Ba1li and death.%} Haughty almost to mad-
<>ness over the unrivalled strength and prowess he got as
<>the result of the boon, Dundubhi went about challeng-
<>ing whomsoever he met for a fight. But none dared to
<>accept the challenge. Then he went to the sea-shore
<>and challenged Varun2a, who, appearing on the crest
<>of the waves said: “I am not strong and powerful
<>enough to fight with you. Only Himava1n can do that.
<>So, please go north.”
<NI>Accordingly Dundubhi went north to Himava1n and
<>challenged him in great rage. Himava1n clad in his neat
<>and white apparel appeared and spoke in humble tones:
<>“Oh mighty Da1nava: I am not accustomed to fighting
<>war. My job is only to arrange necessary conveni-
<>ence to saints and sages. But, there is in southern India
<>a very powerful monkey called Ba1li, who is the King of
<>Kis2kindha1, and Ba1li alone can combat with you.
<NI>And, Dundubhi accordingly went southward to Kis2kin-
<>dha1 and challenged Ba1li. Terrible as the dark clouds in
<>the sky the da1nava who possessed the body and
<>horns of the buffalo--began roaring like hell at the tower
<>gates of Kis2kindha1, uprooting trees with his horn and
<>tearing the earth with his hoofs. Disturbed by the noise
<>Ba1li along with his wife Ta1ra1 came out of the palace,
<>and said to Dundubhi: “Look here, please, I am only
<>a King of the monkeys. Why should you, who are so
<>very strong smash my tower?” but, these soft words of
<>Ba1li only kindled Dundubhi's anger all the more and his
<>challenges became the fiercer. Then did Ba1li, wearing
<>the golden chain given by Indra, rush forth to engage
<>Dundubhi in mortal duel in which the former began
<>gaining more and more strength while the latter got wea-
<>ker and weaker. Dundubhi took to flight in the skies to
<>save his life. But, the moon dawned then and in the
<>moonlight Ba1li and his brother Sugri1va followed Dun-
<>dubhi, who entered a terrible cave covered by something
<>like a forest of grass. After stationing Sugri1va at the
<>opening of the cave Ba1li followed Dundubhi into the
<>cave. Sugri1va waited there one year for the return of
<>Ba1li from the cave when one day he witnessed foaming
<>blood flow out of the mouth of the cave, and mistakenly
<>believing that Ba1li was dead he closed the mouth of the
<>cave with a huge stone and returned home. But, Ba1li,
<>who had by then killed Dundubhi kicked off the stone [Page254-a+ 65]
<>and came out of the cave and followed Sugri1va in a
<>rage. From that day onwards S4ugri1va lived at the R2s2ya-
<>mu1ka mountain where Ba1li had no admission. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 9, 11, 46).
<NI>5) {%Curse on Ba1li due to the blood of Dundubhi.%} During
<>Ba1li's duel with Dundubhi blood from the body of the
<>latter spurted out to the skies, and it also fell in the
<>hermitage of Matan3ga at R2s2yamu1ka where the sage
<>Matan3ga was performing tapas. Angered at this the sage
<>cursed him whoever he might be, who was responsible
<>for blood falling in his a1s4rama, with death by his head
<>getting broken if he mounted R2s2yamu1ka. Sugri1va took
<>shelter there because of this curse on Ba1li. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Canto 11)
<HI>DUNDUBHI II. See under Manthara1.
<HI>DUNDUBHINIHRA1DA. A powerful Ra1ks2asa, who was
<>the son of Diti and the uncle of Prahla1da. When, in
<>the fierce fight between the devas and the asuras the
<>latter got absolutely defeated this Ra1ks2asa ascribed
<>the reson for the failure to the brahmins and began
<>killing them. He captured the Ka1s4i1 temple and many
<>other temples like it. In the circumstances S4iva gave
<>refuge to the brahmins of Ka1s4i1, and the Ra1ks2asa was
<>destroyed by S4ivas4akti. (S4ivarudrasam3hita1, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 58).
<HI>DUNDUBHISVANA(M). A particular Place in Kus4a
<>island. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 13).
<HI>DURA1DHA (DURA1DHA1RA, DURDHARA). One of
<>the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed by
<>Bhi1ma. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 135, Verse 36).
<HI>DURA1DHA1RA. See under Dura1dha.
<HI>DURA1SADA. A son of Bhasma1sura. He learned Pan5ca1k-
<>s2ari1 vidya1 from S4iva and used to repeat it. Pleased at
<>this S4iva gave him all the boons he wanted with the
<>result that he lost his head and began troubling every-
<>body. When thus unrest and injustices increased in the
<>world D2hum3d2hi, the son of S4akti killed him. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 38, 42).
<HI>DURDAMA. Son of a Gandharva called Vis4va1vasu.
<>The following story about him is told in the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a. Chapters 1, 3 and 4).
<NI>While mahars2is like Vasis2t2ha and Atri were once
<>engaged in the worship of Lord S4iva at Mount Kaila1sa,
<>Durdama, with his thousands of wives came there. In
<>the Ha1la1syati1rtha near-by they got engaged in water
<>sports with their bodies stark naked. On seeing their
<>naked sports Vasis2t2ha cursed Durdama to be turned
<>into a Ra1ks2asa. When his wives begged of Vasis2t2ha for
<>redemption from the curse he told them that seven-
<>teen years thence Durdama would regain his old form.
<>Durdama thus turned Ra1ks2asa tried once to devour
<>sage Ga1lava when the Sudars4ana Cakra of Vis2n2u killed
<>him. He regained his old form and returned to
<>Gandharvaloka.
<HI>DURDHARS2AN2A. (Durmada). One of the hundred
<>sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed by Bhi1ma. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 155, Verse 40).
<HI>DURGA1 I. The goddess of the universe, Durga1
<>possesses different forms and aspects. Pa1rvati1, spouse of
<>S4iva is a form of Durga1. According to the prayer of
<>devotees this Devi1 assumes diverse forms. She is
<>worshipped in 64 forms as A1ryadurga1, Vedagarbha1,
<>Ambika1, Bhadraka1li1, Bhadra1, Ks2ema1ks2emakari1, Naika-
<>ba1hu, Devi1 etc. In south India she is worshipped more
<>in her fierce and terrible forms. Devi1 in her gentle [Page254-b+ 65]
<>aspects and moods assumes the forms of Kanya1,
<>Ka1ma1ks2i1 and Mu1ka1mba1. In Kerala the Devi1 is called
<>Bhagavati1 also, in Andhra Jokula1mbika1 and in Tamil-
<>nadu Kan2n2aki1. Worship of the Devi1 is supposed to be
<>more than 4000 years old in India. In religious litera-
<>ture from Vedic times up to date Devi1 occupies an
<>important place. In modern India S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa, guru of Sva1mi1 Viveka1nanda, was a great
<>devotee of Durga1.
<NI>In the Maha1bha1rata there are various references to the
<>Devi1. When the Pa1n2d2avas entered the capital of Vira1t2a
<>for their life incognito they worshiped Durga1, who
<>appeared to them and granted them certain boons.
<>(Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 6). At the commencement of
<>the great war Arjuna, at the instance of Kr2s2n2a prayed
<>to Durga1, who appeared in the sky and granted him
<>boons, for victory in War. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 23).
<>See Pan5cadevi1s and Prakr2ti).
<HI>DURGA1 II. A river famous in ancient India. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas drank water from this river. (Bhi1s2ma Parva.
<>Chapter 9, Verse 33).
<HI>DURGA(M). Fort. There are six kinds of forts, viz.
<>Marudurgam, Jaladurgam, Pr2thvi1durgam Vanadurgam,
<>Parvatadurgam, and Manus2y adurgam. Among the
<>above six Manus2ya durga is the most important (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 56, 35).
<HI>DURGAJAM. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 9, Verse 52).
<HI>DURGAMA. An asura chief born in the dynasty of
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a and son of Taru, Durgama was an enemy
<>of the Devas from his very birth. He argued to him-
<>self thus: “the very strength and power of the
<>Devas depend on the Vedas; if there is no Veda there is
<>no yajn5a, if there is no yajn5a the Devas do not get
<>their share of the havis, if they do not get the havis
<>they will lose all their strength and prowess, and, there-
<>fore, the best means to teach the Devas a lesson is to
<>destroy the Vedas.” Durgama decided that the surest
<>means to achieve that was to perform penance. Accor-
<>dingly he went to the Hima1layas and began doing
<>penance abstaining from food and drink. After a thou-
<>sand years Brahma1 appeared to him and asked him
<>what boon he wanted. Durgama said “I must get the
<>Vedas; I should get all the mantras known to brahmins
<>and Devas in the three worlds, and all the presiding
<>deities of those mantras should come and stand before
<>me and be subject to my control; I must also get the
<>strength to defeat all the Devas.” Brahma1 granted
<>Durgama all the boons. And, thenceforth the brahmins
<>could not recollect the Vedas or the mantras. No
<>bathing, no homas, no daily rites, no rites for the dead,
<>no yajn5as, no japa (repeating divine names) and no
<>tapas. Symptoms of old age caught the Devas in its
<>grips. Durgama drove them out of Devaloka and they
<>hid in mountain caves. Within a hundred years the
<>world reached the rock bottom of destruction. Water
<>disappeared from the world. Alarmed beyond measure
<>at these developments the brahmins went to the Hima1l-
<>ayas and prayed to Jagadambika1 (mother of the uni-
<>verse). Ambika1 appeared to them, and their lamenta-
<>tions brought tears to the eyes of Ambika1, and thus
<>water scarcity came to an end. Ambika1 gave them S4a1ka
<>(a vegetable) fruits and roots to eat. Because she pro-
<>tected her devotees by supplying S4a1ka to them she
<>came to be known as S4a1kambhari1, thenceforward. Also [Page255-a+ 65]
<>because she shed tears from her eyes, thenceforth she
<>came to be addressed as S4ata1ks2i1 also.
<NI>Being told about the above developments Durgama,
<>with his army attacked Devi1. The fight became fierce
<>and furious. From Devi1's body emerged numerous
<>S4aktis fully armed. Dha1rin2i1, Ba1la1, Tripura1, Bhairavi1
<>and Ka1li1 with 10,000 hands were some of the promi-
<>nent and powerful S4aktis which thus emerged. The
<>army of Durgama was annihilated. Then the fight
<>commenced directly between Devi1 and Durgama.
<>Fifteen arrows of Devi1 hit the asura at the very same
<>time and he was killed. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha).

<HI>DURJAYA I. An absolutely cruel King. Owing to the
<>number of adharmas (evil actions he had committed)
<>Ka1la ordained him to be born and reborn twentyone
<>times as various animals and as a Brahmara1ks2asa he
<>roamed about forests. One of those days he caught
<>hold of a S4i1vayogi1 called Maha1deva whose body was
<>smeared with Vibhu1ti (the sacred ash), but as soon as
<>the Vibhu1ti from the body of the S4ivayogi1 got smeared
<>on his body also, Durjaya got back his former form
<>and he was lifted upto Svarga. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Bhasma
<>Ma1ha1tmya).

<>gem called Cinta1man2i. He fought to gain that gem
<>and died. The place where he met with death came to
<>be known as Naimis4a1ran2ya in after years. (Vara1ha
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 17).
<HI>DURJAYA. Short form of Durjayman2imatinagara referred
<>to in laudatory terms in the Maha1bha1rata. Some
<>scholars hold that Durjaya is the Ellora caves of modern
<>India, seven miles off Daulatabad. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 96, Verse 1).
<HI>DURMADA I. See Durdhars2an2a.
<HI>DURMADA II. A son of Ham3sa, the Gandharva King.
<>Himself and Unmada1, the apsara1 woman impersonated
<>themselves and cheated Puru1ravas and Urvas4i1 (See
<>Unmada1). Enraged at the deception Urvas4i1 cursed
<>that Durmada be born as a Ra1ks2asa and Unmada1 a
<>princess. Also, Unmada1 as princess would have to marry
<>not the person she really loved but some one else.
<>Both Durmada and Unmada1 then begged Urvas4i1 for [Page255-b+ 65]
<>redemption from the curse and the latter said thus:
<>“This Durmada will be born as son of Unmada1, and
<>on seeing her son and husband die, she will end her
<>life by burning herself, and her soul will attain Svarga”.
<NI>As a result of the above curse Unmada1 was born as
<>the daughter of the King of Videha and Durmada as
<>the son of the Ra1ks2asa called Di1rghajam3gha. As Ra1ks2asa,
<>Durmada was called Pin3gala1ks2a. The King of Videha
<>named Unmada1 as Harin2i1.
<NI>While Harin2i1 was once walking in the garden with her
<>companions Pin3gala1ks2a abducted her and flew off in
<>the sky, and put her in a great forest. A prince called
<>Vasumanas, who happened to come that way on his
<>fast-riding horse Ji1mu1ta heard the lamentations of
<>Harin2i1, and after killing Pin3gala1ks2a he took her with
<>him to her palace. The King of Videha and his sub-
<>jects, who were in great anxiety and distress at the
<>disappearance of Harin2i1 felt really happy to have her
<>back. And, all of them opined that Harin2i1 should be
<>married to Vasumanas. Accordingly the date for her
<>Svayam3vara was announced. But, on the day of the
<>svayam3vara Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehaya who, along
<>with other Kings was also present on the occasion,
<>forcibly took Harin2i1 and rode off with her. According
<>to the condition laid down by Urvas4i1 for redemption
<>from her curse Durmada was born as son of Harin2i1 and
<>he was named Durmada.
<NI>Bhadras4ren2ya, Harin2i1 and Durmada lived very happily
<>in the Hehaya palace. When Durmada came of age he
<>married Citra1n3gi1, his uncle's daughter on the advice
<>of sage Garga. Soon war broke out between Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya, and Divoda1sa, King of Ka1s2i in which Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya was killed. Harin2i1 courted death by fire,
<>regained her former life and under the name Unmada1
<>returned to the world of the Apsaras.
<HI>DURMADA III. Son of Asura Maya. Conceited and
<>haughty over his strength Durmada once challenged

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A sage, who used to lose his temper
<>very easily. He is believed to have been born from an
<>am3s4a (part, aspect) of S4iva. [Page256-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three different stories are told in the
<>Pura1n2as relating to his birth.
<NI>(1) Once a quarrel, arose between Brahma1 and S4iva
<>which developed into fighting, At the sight of S4iva
<>seething with rage the Devas ran off frightened, and
<>Pa1rvati1 also got frightened. She told him ‘Durva1sam
<>bhavati me’. (It has become impossible for me to live
<>happily with you). Realising that it was his momentary
<>anger which made life miserable for Pa1rvati1 S4iva
<>decided to transfer that trait of his character to some-
<>one else.
<NI>The incident took place during the life period of
<>S4i1lavati1, who was very much reputed for her chastity.
<>While S4i1lavati1 was carrying her husband Ugras4ravas
<>(who though a leper yet desired to visit brothels) to
<>the house of a prostitute the muni An2uma1n2d2avya
<>cursed Ugras4ravas to die before sunrise the next day
<>with his head broken. (See under An2uma1n2d2avya).
<>S4i1lavati1 made the counter curse, let not the sun rise the
<>next day, to the muni's curse. Accordingly the sun did
<>not rise the next day, and confusion prevailed every-
<>where, whereupon the Trimu1rtis and the Devas, through
<>Anasu1ya1, the wife of Atrimahars2i, got the curse of
<>S4i1lavati1 withdrawn. Pleased at this the Trimu1rtis
<>asked Anasu1ya1 to choose any boon she desired, and she
<>prayed that Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara take their
<>partial incarnations through her. Accordingly Brahma1
<>as Candra and Maha1vis2n2u as Datta1treya were born as
<>sons of Anasu1ya1. And, S4iva deposited his anger, which
<>had caused unhappiness to Pa1rvati1, in Anasu1ya1. The
<>child born out of that aspect of S4iva to Anasu1ya1 was
<>Durva1sas. The name Durva1sas was very apt as the
<>child was born out of the anger of S4iva which had
<>made life miserable (durva1sa) for Pa1rvati1. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>(2) Once defeated in his fight with Brahma1 S4iva took
<>refuge with the Narana1ra1yan2as who were doing penance
<>in the plains of the Hima1layas. S4iva told sage
<>Na1ra1yan2a everything about his plight and he asked the
<>former to pierce his left hand with the S4u1la. S4iva did
<>so and three streams of blood flowed out of the wound
<>made on the hand of the R2s2i, one stream towards the
<>sphere of the stars, another into the skull in S4iva's
<>hand and from the third stream Durva1sas was born.
<>Brahma1, who witnessed this miracle withdrew from
<>war and returned to his abode. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) In the fierce fight with the Tripuras S4iva, in great
<>rage, ultimately shot an arrow against them, and that
<>arrow, after killing the Tripuras, assumed the form of
<>a child and returned to the lap of S4iva, and the child
<>was named Durva1sas. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 160, Verses 14, 15).
<NI>3) {%Kunti1 granted boon.%} Once while Kunti1 was living in
<>the palace of Kuntibhoja Durva1sas came there, and
<>pleased with Kunti1, he granted her five mantras. It
<>was with the aid of those mantras that Kunti became
<>mother of Karn2a and others. (For details see under
<>Kunti Para 2).
<NI>4) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a bathed in pa1yasa (pudding).%} Once Durva1sas
<>came to Dva1raka1 where Kr2s2n2a and Rukmini1 looked
<>after him to his heart's content. Though, at times he
<>took only meagre food, at other times he destroyed
<>everything he saw and created trouble. Kr2s2n2a and
<>Rukmin2i1 served him according to schedule. One day [Page257-a+ 65]
<>the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to cook some pudding and it was
<>got ready. Then the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to smear his
<>(Kr2s2n2a) body with pudding. Kr2s2n2a did so except on
<>his feet. After that Durva1sas got down the chariot and
<>making Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 serve as horses himself got
<>into it and drove away in great speed into the forest.
<>On the way he thrashed the ‘horses’ one ofter the
<>other. Neither Kr2s2n2a nor Rukmin2i1 felt sorry about this
<>action of the sage. On reaching the forest he halted
<>the chariot and blessed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a that arrows would
<>not hit the parts of Kr2s2n2a's body which were smeared
<>with the pa1yasa. The spot at which the sage blessed
<>Kr2s2n2a became famous as Varada1nati1rtha in after years.
<>It may be noted that Kr2s2n2a died by an arrow hitting
<>his foot which was not smeared with the pa1yasa. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 160).
<NI>5) {%Conducted yajn5a for S4vetaki.%} There once was a King
<>called S4vetaki equal to Indra. He conducted a yajn5a
<>of a hundred years' duration. Innumerable brahmins
<>were engaged in the successful conduct of the yajn5a.
<>Some years after the yajn5a began the brahmins went
<>their own way leaving it unfinished as the clouds of
<>fume all the twentyfour hours in the yajn5as4a1la1 irked
<>and affected their eyes. When S4vetaki requested them
<>to further cooperate to complete the yajn5a they
<>insultingly asked him to invite S4u1dras for it. Then
<>the King went to the Hima1layas and did tapas for
<>S4iva, who at last deputed Durva1sas to complete the
<>yajn5a, and under the mahars2i's aegis it was completed
<>within twelve years. On account of the constant offe-
<>rings of havis in Agni (fire) during the period Agni
<>fell a prey to indigestion, which was cured only after
<>it ate up the Kha1n2d2ava forest. (See Kha1n2d2ava dahana).
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 235).
<NI>6) {%Mudgala granted salvation.%} Once Durva1sas went to
<>sage Mudgala who was doing tapas in Kuruks2etra
<>taking food only rarely and demanded some food with
<>the object of testing his dharmavr2tti (righteousness).
<>The sage gave Durva1sas all the food he had with him,
<>himself starving, and Durva1sas left the a1s4rama after
<>eating a part of the food and smearing his body with
<>the rest of it. This process was repeated by Durva1sas
<>for six days, but Mudgala never felt or showed any
<>offence. Greatly pleased at the firm righteousness of
<>the King. Durva1sas blessed him to bodily ascend to
<>heaven. Immediately a vima1na (aeroplane) descended
<>from Vis2n2uloka and carried Mudgala in it to heaven.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 260).
<NI>7) {%Other information.%} (1) Durva1sas ran away in fear of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. (See under Duryodhana, Para 12).
<NI>(2) He suffered at the hands of Ham3sa and D2ibhaka.
<>(See under D2ibhaka).
<NI>(3) He advised S4aivapan5ca1ks2ara to the woman called
<>Kala1vati1. (See under Kala1vati1).
<NI>(4) Durva1sas and Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam. (See under
<>Amr2tam).
<NI>(5) Durva1sas and Daks2ayajn5a. (See under Daks2a).
<NI>(6) Terrified Durva1sas ran helter-skelter in the three
<>worlds. (See under Am3bari1s2a, Para 3).
<NI>(7) He was responsible for the death of Laks2man2a.
<>(See Laks2man2a).
<NI>(8) He cursed S4akuntala1. (See S4akuntala1).
<NI>(9) He spent his time in Indra's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 23: For another story
<>see under Pitr2ti1rtha). [Page257-b+ 64]
<HI>DURVIBHA1GA. A particular area in ancient India.
<>The Ks2atriya kings of the area presented a lot of
<>money and foodgrains to Yudhis2t2hira at the Ra1jasu1ya
<>yajn5a. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 11).
<HI>DURVIGA1HA (DURVIS2AHA). One of the hundred
<>sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed in the great war by
<>Bhi1masena. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 26, Verse 20).

<>or Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He attended the svayam3vara of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1, On the occasion of the procession of Duryo-
<>dhana and others, Durvis2aha was put in prison. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 242, Verse 12). He was killed by
<>Bhi1masena in the great war. (S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>26, Verse 20).
<HI>DURYODHANA I. Villain in the Maha1bha1rata story;
<>the eldest and greatest of the Kauravas.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Kauravas.
<NI>(2) {%Birth.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra born blind married Ga1ndha1ri1.
<>Hungry and thirsty, Vya1sa once came to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>palace where Ga1ndha1ri1 treated him sumptuously, and
<>he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband.
<>Ere long Ga1ndha1ri1 conceived, but even after two years
<>she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got
<>herself aborted in secret as the result of which she
<>‘delivered’ a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vya1sa
<>visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled
<>with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold
<>water as a result of which it got divided into hundred
<>pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of
<>flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the
<>pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place.
<>Vya1sa departed for the Hima1layas for tapas.
<NI>In course of time the pots burst open one by one and
<>from each pot emerged a boy. From the 101st pot a girl
<>was born. Eldest among the boys was named
<>Duryodhana, and the girl called Dus4s4ala1. (For other
<>names see under Kauravas).
<NI>Duryodhana, at the time of his birth cried in the voice
<>of an ass on hearing which the asses kept in their shed
<>also cried. Also, such evil omens as the jackal howling,
<>birds like crows, vultures etc. crying and storms break-
<>ing out were witnessed on the occasion. Alarmed by
<>such evil omens Dhr2tara1s2t2ra sent for the brahmins and
<>his other friends and well-wishers like Bhi1s2ma and Vidura
<>and enquired of them whether, after the death of
<>Dharmaputra, Duryodhana would be able to become
<>King. As soon as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra had asked the question, evil
<>omens like the world becoming dim, jackals howling etc.
<>were witnessed again. Scholars like Vidura did their best
<>to divine what the future of Duryodhana would be, and
<>after mature consideration Vidura and the brahmin
<>pandits opined that because of Duryodhana's birth the
<>country and people would be ruined, and they, there-
<>fore advised that he should be cast away and forsaken.
<>But, paternal affection did not permit Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to
<>accept the advice.
<NI>During this period Ga1ndha1ri1 was laid up for a few days
<>with stomach trouble, and a vais4ya woman was engaged [Page258-a+ 65]
<>to look after Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who begot of her a son called
<>Yuyutsu.
<F>1. Vya1sa blessed Ga1ndha1ri1 to have 100 sons. Then how was it that she got a daughter too? On being questioned thus by King
<>Janamejaya Vais4am3pa1yana replied “when Vya1sa was dividing the mass of flesh a desire to have a daughter entered the heart of Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and divining that desire Vya1sa cut the flesh in such a manner as to have one more piece, viz. 101</F> Thus with 100 sons and Dus4s4ala1 for daughter
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra became rich in the matter of children
<F>2. Duryodhana was born as a part of Kali. (M.B. A1s4rama va1sika Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<>(M.B. Adi Parva, Chapter 114).
<NI>(2) {%Duryodhana harms Bhi1masena.%} Now, Pa1n2d2u was
<>dead and Ma1dri1 also died in the funeral pyre of her
<>husband. Forlorn and helpless Kunti1 and her five sons
<>came to Hastina1pura, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra welcomed them
<>to the palace. Thus arose the occasion for the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas to live together in the Hastina1-
<>pura palace. And, naturally there used to be petty
<>differences and quarrels between the Pa1n2d2ava and
<>Kaurava princes. Bhi1ma being in every way a giant the
<>Kauravas had often to suffer at his hands. To collect all
<>the hundred Kaurava brothers together and throw them
<>away in one lump to push them to the ground, to suffo-
<>cate them by holding their heads under water etc--these
<>were some of the childish pranks played by Bhi1ma on
<>the Kauravas. The constant repetition of such pranks
<>and mischiefs on the part of Bhi1ma rendered him an
<>object of hatred for the Kauravas among whom the
<>common conviction grew that it was essential to put an
<>end to Bhi1ma's life for their safety, nay even their very
<>existence.
<NI>One day, the Kauravas, with the object of doing away
<>with Bhi1ma, escorted the Pa1n2d2avas to Prama1n2akot2i on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for water sports. There all of
<>them ate sumptuous meals and took various drinks. But,
<>Duryodhana had secretly mixed Ka1laku1t2a poison in the
<>food of Bhi1ma. After taking meals they began playing
<>water-sports. After the sports were over they returned
<>to their tents and slept. Owing to the effects of the
<>poison and the overexertion during the day Bhi1ma
<>slept stone dead. While all were asleep during the night
<>Duryodhana bound the hands and legs of Bhi1ma with
<>cords and threw him into the depths of the Ga1n3ga1.
<>Bhi1ma who was still unconscious sank down to the very
<>bottom of the river where the denizens of na1galoka saw
<>him and the na1gas bit him in anger. The poison of the
<>na1gas neutralised the effects of Ka1laku1t2a poison in
<>Bhi1ma, though their bite could not make even a scratch
<>on his skin. Freed thus from the effects of poison Bhi1ma
<>shook himself up from sleep and drove off the na1gas.
<>Alarmed at these developments the na1gas called Va1suki
<>up to the scene, and he, recognising Bhi1ma held him in
<>embrace and gave him much money and costly gems
<>etc. Bhi1ma refused the gifts, but asked Va1suki for na1ga-
<>rasa, which would impart the strength of thousand na1gas
<>to those who used it. Va1suki gave Bhi1ma eight potfuls
<>of na1garasa, which the latter drank to the last dregs
<>and thus gained immeasurable strength.
<NI>When next morning after the water-sports the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas awoke from sleep Bhi1ma was found
<>missing. Duryodhana said that Bhi1ma had returned
<>earlier to Hastina1pura, but this did not satisfy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. Kunti1 lamented over the absence of Bhi1ma.
<NI>Bhi1ma, who drank the na1ga rasa lay on the veranda of
<>Va1suki for eight days in the manner of one who had
<>lost consciousness. By the time he woke up on the eighth
<>day the body had almost fully assimilated the rasa.
<>Va1suki told Bhi1ma that eight potfuls of na1garasa [Page258-b+ 61]
<>would impart the strength of 10,000 elephants. And
<>then at the instance of Va1suki Bhi1ma took his bath in
<>holy waters and wore new clothes and fragrant garland.
<>He ate the pudding offered by Va1suki, and taking leave
<>of him and followed by na1gas he came up from the
<>water to the bank of the Gan3ga1. Bhi1ma gave a detailed
<>description to his mother and brothers of all that had
<>happened to him. Dharmaputra advised him to keep
<>the secret. After the incident, once again was Ka1laku1t2a
<>poison mixed in the food of Bhi1ma. But, Yuyutsu born
<>of the vais4ya woman to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra gave the Pa1n2d2avas
<>confidential report about it. Because of the powerful
<>effect of na1ga rasa, the Ka1laku1t2a consumed by Bhi1ma
<>did no harm to him but it only got assimilated in his
<>body. On another occasion Duryodhana killed the
<>charioteer of Bhi1ma. (Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, Chapter 127 and
<>129).
<NI>3) {%Karn2a crowned king of An3ga.%} The Kauravas and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas learnt the use of weapons of war at the feet
<>of Dron2a1ca1rya, and when the studies were over arrange-
<>ments were made for a rehearsal, and at the rehearsal
<>Bhi1ma and Duryodhana were the first to clash with
<>each other. When the encounter reached its climax
<>both of them pointed the club at each other. But, As4vat-
<>tha1ma1 intervened and pacified them. Next Karn2a enter-
<>ed the stage for a trial of strength with Arjuna, and
<>at once arose from the Pa1n2d2ava side questions about
<>Karn2a's nobility and aristocracy of birth etc. Karn2a
<>stood there stunned, not knowing what to say or how
<>to repel the attack. Then it was Duryodhana who rose
<>up to announce that he was, that very moment, crowning
<>Karn2a King of An3ga. This ended the scene. (Bha1rata
<>(Malaya1lam), A1di Parva, Chapters 134, 135 and 136).
<NI>4) {%Pa1n2d2avas trapped in palace built of lac.%} The above
<>incident confirmed and completed the cleavage of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas into two hostile camps.
<>Meantime another event happened. Dron2a1ca1rya demand-
<>ed of his pupils to bring before him King Drupada
<>by way of gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee), for the a1ca1rya had
<>to wreak vengeance upon Drupada (See under Dron2a).
<>Though Duryodhana tried his best he could not capture
<>Drupada. Not only that, Drupada defeated him also in
<>fight. At this junture it was Arjuna who presented
<>Drupada as captive to Dron2a by way of gurudaks2in2a1.
<>The incident proved to be another provocation for
<>Duryodhana to hate the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>Now, Duryodhana made up his mind to destroy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas somehow or other. With this end in view he
<>went to his father, posing himself to be a great well-
<>wisher of the Pa1n2d2avas, and obtained his permission to
<>transfer their (Pa1n2d2avas') residence to another palace.
<>Accordingly Duryodhana deputed his minister Purocana
<>to get built at Va1ran2a1vata a palace of lac. Vidura came
<>to know of the intended mischief and gave advance
<>notice of it to the Pa1n2d2avas through a messenger
<>Kanaka. The architect built the ‘lac palace’ but built a
<>tunnel also attached to it. A year after the Pa1n2d2avas shift-
<>ed the residence to the new ‘palace’ Duryodhana set.
<>fire to it, and the Pa1n2d2avas escaped unscathed through
<>this tunnel. (Bha1rata (Malaya1lam) A1di Parva, Chapters
<>141-151). [Page259-a+ 64]
<NI>5) {%Duryodhana invited the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hastina1pura.%}
<>Duryodhana and his brothers were living very happily
<>under the impression that the Pa1n2d2avas had been burnt
<>to ashes along with the ‘lac Palace’. Then it was that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas, disguised as brahmins and in the presence
<>of all the Kings, won Pa1n5ca1li1, the daughter of King
<>Drupada, in svayam3vara, for their wife. After the
<>marriage the Pa1n2d2avas stayed in Drupada's palace and
<>the Kauravas returned to Hastina1pura. Duryodhana
<>and others felt all the more jealous at the Pa1n2d2avas'
<>becoming more powerful as a result of their marriage.
<>Again it was decided that the Pa1n2d2avas should be des-
<>troyed anyhow and at any cost. But, how to effect the
<>destruction? Duryodhana wanted to attract the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas to destruction through women and to create diffe-
<>rences and divisions among them. But, Karn2a attacked
<>the plan as impracticable, and instead he wanted to
<>defeat Drupada and render the Pa1n2d2avas impotent. At
<>this stage Bhi1s2ma and Dron2a argued that it was most
<>preferable to give half the Kingdom to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and receive them with grace. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra supported
<>the proposal as a result of which the Kauravas went to
<>Pa1n5ca1la and escorted the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hasti-
<>na1pura. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra partitioned the country between
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas and the latter shifted
<>their residence to their part of the country with Kha1n2-
<>d2avaprasth2a (Indraprastha) as its capital. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas went to Indraprastha Maya built for them
<>an2 exceptionally beautiful palace where King Dharma-
<>putra performed {%ra1jasu1ya.%} Duryodhana and others ear-
<>nestly participated in it. After the ra1jasu1ya the Kaura-
<>vas wanted to have a look at the palace and in the
<>course of surveying it they placed themselves in
<>ridiculous situations due to visual illusions. Taking the
<>bright floors of glass for watery tanks they pulled up
<>their clothings and measured with caution every foot of
<>theirs. Then they mistook actual pools for floor and fell
<>into them and got wet. At the consequent discomfiture
<>of the Kauravas Bhi1ma clapped his hands and roared
<>with laughter. Draupadi1 hid her face with hands and
<>smiled. Altogether the Kauravas cut a very ridiculous
<>figure, and they returned to Hastina1pura. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 202, Sabha1 Parva, Chapters 35, 85).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's first defeat in the game of dice.%} The
<>sight of the great wealth including costly stones and
<>gems presented by various kings to Dharmaputra at the
<>Ra1jasu1ya and the humiliation experienced while survey-
<>ing the palace made Duryodhana all the more mad
<>with anger and hatred towards the Pa1n2d2avas. He now
<>came to the decision either to defeat the Pa1n2d2avas once
<>for all or to commit suicide by taking poison. He held
<>secret consultations on the topic with S4akuni whose
<>efforts at first to pacify him (Duryodhana) failed. Ulti-
<>mately S4akuni, an expert in the game of dice, advised
<>Duryodhana to invite Dharmaputra to a game, assuring
<>him that the rest he would take care of. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Vidura advised Duryodhana against the move, but he
<>did not yield. Finally Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, saying to himself
<>that nobody would change fate, agreed to Duryodhana's
<>proposal, and deputed Vidura to Dharmaputra to invite
<>him for the game.
<NI>Dharmaputra, in fact, did not like the game, but he
<>succumbed to the eloquence and persuasive powers of
<>S4akuni and at last agreed to play. Kings lined up the [Page259-b+ 64]
<>royal hall to witness the game. First gems were staked.
<>and Duryodhana won the game. Then 1000 golden niskas
<F>1. 108 suvarn2a weight, an ornament worn on the chest.</F>
<>and treasuries were offered to the winner. Duryodhana
<>won that game also. Next chariot with horses and next
<>to that 1000 maid-servants were staked and Duryodhana
<>won those games too. 1000 horses, 1000 golden chariots
<>with their horses, the horse decorated with gold presen-
<>ted by Citraratha to Arjuna, 6000 soldiers with their
<>arms and armaments--these formed the next successive
<>bets, and each game Dharmaputra lost. The next bet
<>was 400 copper vessels each filled with pure gold, and
<>Duryodhana won that game also. And, now Vidura
<>tried to dissuade Yudhis2t2hira from playing the game;
<>but neither he nor Duryodhana heeded the advice. And,
<>Duryodhana by foul play snatched from Dharmaputra
<>all his wealth, his kingdom and his brothers. Now, Pa1n5-
<>ca1li1 alone remained, and Dharmaputra bet her too
<>and played the last game and lost.
<NI>Duryodhana deputed his Su1ta, Pra1tika1mi, to Indra-
<>prastha, to fetch Draupadi1 but she sent him back. Next
<>Dus4s4a1sana was deputed and he brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to the
<>sabha1 dragging her by the hair. She was proclaimed to
<>be the maid-servant of the Kauravas. At last Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>intervened and sent back the Pa1n2d2avas along with
<>Draupadi1 to Indraprastha.
<NI>7) {%Second game and exile in the forest.%} Duryodhana and
<>others did not appreciate the intervention of their father.
<>He again conspired with S4akuni and it was decided to
<>challenge Dharmaputra to one more game. The condi-
<>tions to be stipulated were that the vanquished in the
<>game should stay in exile for twelve years in the forest
<>and live incognito during the thirteenth year, and if
<>found out and recognised during this period the whole
<>process of exile and life incognito would have to be
<>repeated. Duryodhana and S4ukuni approached Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and said to him thus: “Dear father, the desire
<>for revenge at their defeat in the game of dice gnaws
<>at the Pa1n2d2avas' heart like poison. Also, they will never
<>forget our having dragged Draupadi1 by her hair. When
<>a suitable occasion arises they will take revenge on the
<>whole lot of us. Therefore, we want to challenge
<>Dharmaputra to a final game of dice, the condition
<>being that he who gets defeated should go in exile into
<>the forest for twelve years and then to live incognito
<>for one year. If we get defeated we will simply carry
<>out the condition on our part.
<NI>This request of Duryodhana appealed to his father, who
<>invited Dharmaputra once again for a game of dice.
<>Dharmaputra accepted the invitation, in fact, in spite
<>of himself. This time too Duryodhana won the stake
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas set out to the forest. Even at the
<>time of parting Dus4s4a1sana insulted Bhi1ma who retorted
<>thus: “You, mean fellows, you cheated my brother by
<>foul play. If I fail to tear your heart open in fight and
<>drink blood I do not want heaven. Moreover I will kill
<>Duryodhana, and Arjuna will kill Karn2a. S4akuni, the
<>expert in foul play in dice will be killed by Sahadeva.
<>We will meet in the 14th year from today at the
<>battlefield. Adieu.”
<NI>Thus did the Pa1n2d2avas depart for the forest. Kunti1
<>being too old Vidura took her to his house, and he
<>consoled her, lamenting over the separation from her
<>children. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva). [Page260-a+ 64]
<NI>8) {%Curse of Maitreya.%} The Pa1n2d2avas entered the
<>Ka1myaka forest where they were welcomed by the
<>sages. Among them Maitreya whom the misfortune
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas affected much started for Hastina1pura
<>for peace parleys. Vidura advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that
<>Maitreya's proposals should be respected lest he should
<>curse the King. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Duryodhana received
<>the sage with respect. And, the sage asked them to
<>recall the Pa1n2d2avas from the forest and live on friendly
<>terms with them. Duryodhana did not in any manner
<>respond to the advice of the sage, but stood there
<>absolutely mum tapping his thigh with his fingers and
<>making drawings with the fingers of his feet on the
<>ground. This the sage interpreted as an insult to him.
<>He stood up ablaze with anger and cursed Duryodhana
<>thus: “You will, sooner than later reap the conse-
<>quences of your false pride; your cruelty will invite
<>terrible war, and in the fight Bhi1ma will rend asunder
<>your thigh, which you struck with your fingers
<>just now.”
<NI>Greatly agitated over the curse Dhr2tara1s2t2ra prayed
<>the sage for redemption and the sage said: “if only
<>your son resorts to forebearance and peace the curse
<>will not take effect, otherwise it will come true.” And
<>after making this announcement the sage returned to
<>the forest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 10).
<NI>9) {%The procession.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were staying
<>in the Ka1myaka forest Duryodhana and others went
<>there on the pretext of looking after the cows. The
<>Gandharvas took them captive; but the Pa1n2d2avas
<>intervened and set them free. Feeling humiliated at the
<>mishap Duryodhana decided to end his life after crown-
<>ing Dus4s4a1sana as King. But Dus4s4a1sana did not agree
<>to the proposal. (For details see Ghos2aya1tra1).
<NI>10) {%Duryodhana's attempt at death and his trip to Pa1ta1la.%}
<>Humiliated at the procession thus and turning down
<>the advice of friends to return to the palace, Duryo-
<>dhana spread grass on the ground and lay down there
<>to die. As his death would spell disaster to the Da1navas
<>they decided to send him back to his palace for which
<>purpose they performed the Vaita1na sacrifice in Pa1ta1la.
<>While offering milk in the sacrificial fire a Ra1ks2asa
<>woman, Kr2tya1, arose therefrom, and at the instance
<>of the Da1navas she carried Duryodhana over to Pa1ta1la.
<>There they told him thus: “Oh Duryodhana, a part
<>of your body has been earned by us from S4iva by our
<>penance. That part of your body above the waist is
<>made of diamond. Therefore, arrows will not pierce
<>your body. Grieve not. Bhagadatta and other heroes
<>have been born to help you. Your great supporter
<>Karn2a is possessed of the soul of Naraka1sura.” These
<>words of the Da1navas instilled fresh hope in Duryo-
<>dhana, and he was taken back to his Kingdom by Kr2tya1.
<>This incident appeared as a dream to Duryodhana.
<>Bucking up confidence and courage again he returned
<>to Hastina1pura and continued to rule (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 252).
<NI>11) {%Duryodhana's Vis2n2u yajn5a.%} At this juncture Duryo-
<>dhana thought of performing a Ra1jasu1ya for which he
<>invited brahmins to the palace. After bestowing much
<>thought on the subject the brahmins pointed out that
<>there was no sanction for Duryodhana to conduct a
<>Ra1jasu1ya as his elders, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Dharmaputra
<>were still alive. At the same time they pointed out that [Page260-b+ 64]
<>there was another Yajn5a called Vis2n2u Yajn5a as efficaci-
<>ous as Ra1jasu1ya which Duryodhana was competent to
<>perform. Accordingly Duryodhana performed the Vis2n2u
<>yajn5a and earned reputation among evil monarchs.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 256, 257).
<NI>12) {%Boon from Durva1sas.%} Once Durva1sas accompanied
<>by his disciples, came to Duryodhana's palace, and
<>Duryodhana decided somehow or other to befriend and
<>use the mahars2i as a weapon against the Pa1n2d2avas. He
<>housed the mahars2i and his disciples in the palace for
<>a few days and pleased them by careful service at which
<>the mahars2i asked Duryodhana to request for any boon
<>he desired. And, Duryodhana asked the mahars2i to
<>visit the Pa1n2d2avas one day in the forest with his disciples
<>when they had finished taking their meals. The
<>mahars2i agreed. And, this was the period of time when
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 had received the aks2ayapa1tra from Su1rya.
<>Everyday the pa1tra would produce enough food for the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the other people with them, but it would
<>become empty for the day after Pa1n5ca1li1 had eaten her
<>food. This was the nature of the aks2ayapa1tra.
<NI>Pa1n5ca1li1 had finished her meals one day when Durva1sas
<>and his disciples came to the Pa1n2d2avas. Not knowing
<>that Pa1n5ca1li1 had already finished her food Dharma-
<>putra welcomed the mahars2i and his disciples and
<>requested them to take bath in the Gan3ga1 and return for
<>their meals. Pa1n5ca1li1 was in a fix. The aks2ayapa1tra
<>would not produce any more food for the day, and if
<>not duly fed the mahars2i would get angry and curse
<>them. In this painful dilemma she prayed to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>for succour, and lo! he appeared and asked Pa1n5ca1li1 for
<>some food. She replied that the aks2ayapa1tra was quite
<>empty. But, Kr2s2n2a got from her the pa1tra and ate one
<>particle of Ki1ra (a leafy vegetable) which had stuck on
<>its side. That leafy substance fully satisfied his hunger
<>and thirst whereupon the hunger and thirst of Durva1sas
<>and his disciples were also quenched. Then Kr2s2n2a
<>asked Sahadeva to bring back the mahars2i and his
<>disciples from the bank of the Gan3ga1 and accordingly
<>he went there and invited them. Only a few minutes
<>had passed since the mahars2i and his disciples had felt
<>the satisfaction of a sumptuous meal. They were also
<>astonished to think how in such a short time food for so
<>many people could be cooked by Pa1n5ca1li1. They felt
<>rather anxious about the reaction which Dharmaputra
<>would evince in case they returned to him to say that
<>they required no food. Durva1sas realised only too well
<>that to quarrel with the Pa1n2d2avas, who enjoyed the
<>friendship and support of Kr2s2n2a was like playing with
<>fire. Therefore, the mahars2i with his disciples ran away
<>from the place secretly. Pa1n2d2avas waited long for the
<>mahars2i and his disciples to return fearing that the object
<>of Durva1sas might be to return at the untimely hour
<>and curse them. But, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a told them the details
<>about the mahars2i's departure and assured Dharma-
<>putra that he and his disciples would not return. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 263).
<NI>13) {%War against Vira1t2a.%} After twelve years' exile in the
<>forest the Pa1n2d2avas began their life incogni to at Vira1t2a
<>nagara. Ki1caka, brother-in-law of Ma1tsya, the Vira1t2a
<>King, was killed secretly by Bhi1masena, and news was
<>spread that Ki1caka was killed by a Gandharva.
<NI>None of the spies deputed by Duryodhana to spot out
<>the Pa1n2d2avas during their life incognito could gather [Page261-a+ 65]
<>any information about them. One of those days
<>Sus4arman, King of Trigarta, told Duryodhana that the
<>Vira1t2a King had lost his power and spirits due to the
<>death of Ki1caka and it was, therefore, the proper time
<>to attack the Vira1t2a country and subjugate it thor-
<>oughly. The idea appealed to Karn2a, who prompted
<>Duryodhana to war against Vira1t2a. The army was
<>fully mobilised. As an excuse for the war, at the ins-
<>tance of Duryodhana, Sus4arman, King of Trigarta
<>lifted innumerable cows of the Vira1t2a King. This
<>happened on the day on which the life incognito of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas was to have ended. And war started thus.
<>The Vira1t2a prince Uttara who spent his time in the
<>zenana in the palace appeared in the field of war.
<>Arjuna, under the assumed name of Br2hannala took up
<>the charioteership of Uttara. But, at the sight of the
<>vast Kaurava army Uttara fainted, and Arjuna hurried-
<>ly drove the chariot over to where his bow ga1n2d2i1va
<>was kept hidden, and with the bow in his hands Arjuna
<>jumped into the thick of the fight. A fierce war ensued
<>in which the Kaurava army was completely routed.
<>The life incognito of the Pa1n2d2avas was also over, and
<>Duryodhana became naturally anxious about the future
<>of things. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>14) {%Preparation for war.%} Duryodhana refused to give
<>the Pa1n2davas, even after their return from twelve years'
<>exile in forest and one year's life incognito, even ‘as much
<>land as would hold a pin’, and war became inevitable.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas fought the great war which
<>lasted for eighteen days on the field of Kuruks2etra.
<NI>(1) {%Duryodhana went to invite S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Preparations for
<>the war were gathering speed and momentum. Both
<>the sides were on the look out for more friends and
<>allies. Being told that Arjuna had gone to Dva1raka1 to
<>seek Kr2s2n2a's support Duryodhana rushed to the place.
<>Seeing Duryodhana from a distance Kr2s2n2a lay on his
<>bed in a false sleep, and Duryodhana took his seat
<>on a stool at the head of the bed awaiting Kr2s2n2a to
<>awake from sleep. Soon after, Arjuna came there and
<>he stood at the feet of Kr2s2n2a with head bowed down.
<>When Kr2s2n2a awoke from sleep it was Arjuna whom he
<>saw first, and while exchanging greetings with Arjuna
<>he was told that it was Duryodhana, who had come
<>first. But when Duryodhana and Arjuna explained the
<>object of their visit he told them thus:--
<NI>“No doubt it was Duryodhana who came first. But, it
<>was Arjuna whom I met first. Since Duryodhana came
<>first and I saw Arjuna first I shall help both of you in
<>war. There is the adage that youngsters should be
<>given priority of consideration. So, Arjuna may indi-
<>cate his preference first. I shall give one of you an army
<>of 10 lakhs of warrlors as strong in body as myself,
<>and I shall stand by the other without arms and with-
<>out fighting. Arjuna may make his choice first. And,
<>he chose Kr2s2n2a for his side in the war while Duryodhana
<>was happy to get Kr2s2n2a's mighty army. (M.B. Udyoga-
<>Parva, Chapter 7).
<NI>(2) Duryodhana sought Balabhadra's help but Bala-
<>bhadra told him frankly that since he could not forsake
<>Kr2s2n2a he would remain neutral in the war. (M. B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 25).
<NI>(3) Duryodhana got an aks2auhin2i1 (a specific division of
<>army) from Kr2tavarman. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7,
<>Verse 32).
<NI>(4) S4alya promised to captain the Kaurava army. [Page261-b+ 65]
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 18).
<NI>(5) Duryodhana could collect a total of eleven aks2a-
<>uhin2i1s. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 27).
<NI>(6) He assured Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that the Kaurava army
<>would easily defeat the Pa1n2d2ava army. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 57).
<NI>(7) He declared that war was a yajn5a. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(8) At the instance of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra a rest house was
<>built for S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a on his way to the Kauravas for
<>compromise talks on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 85).
<NI>(9) Duryodhana opined that Kr2s2n2a be taken captive
<>when he came to plead for compromise and peace,
<>but the others did not support him. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Verse 13).
<NI>(10) Duryodhana worshipped Kr2s2n2a with rare and
<>excellent things and invited him for meals, but Kr2s2n2a
<>did not accept any. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>91, Verse 13).
<NI>(11) Duryodhana rejected the advice of sage Kan2va
<>to come to terms with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapters 97-105).
<NI>(12) He emphatically announced in the Kaurava
<>assembly that even as much land as may be required
<>to hold a pin would not be given to the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 26).
<NI>(13) Kr2s2n2a's pleadings in the Kaurava assembly for
<>peace and amity on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas failed to
<>have any effect. On the occasion Duryodhana, S4akuni,
<>Karn2a and Dus4s4a1sana conspired to take Kr2s2n2a captive.
<>Sa1tyaki informed Kr2s2n2a secretly about the conspiracy
<>and Kr2s2n2a informed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra about it, and he
<>warned the conspirators against their wicked plan.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 13, Verse 4).
<NI>(14) Duryodhana appointed Kr2pa, Dron2a, S4alya,
<>Jayadratha, Ha1rdika, As4vattha1ma1, Karn2a, S4akuni,
<>Ba1lhi1ka and Ka1mboja as commanders of the army.

<>in-Chief of the army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156

<HI>DUS4S4A1SANA II. Another Dus4s4a1sana, servant of the
<>son of King Khad2gaba1hu of Saura1s2t2ra is also mentioned
<>in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Khad2gaba1hu had a famous elephant, which one night
<>broke its chains and escaped, and all the mahouts
<>could not chain it again. People in terror of the elephant
<>ran helter-skelter. Now, a brahmin was going that way
<>chanting verses of the 16th Chapter of the Gi1ta1, and even
<>though the mahouts warned him he did not change
<>his path. Instead he saluted the elephant by touching
<>its cheeks and proceeded on his way unhurt by the ani-
<>mal. The King felt great respect for the brahmin when
<>he was told that he owed his miraculous powers to
<>the 16th chapter of the Gi1ta1, and he took the brahmin
<>with him to his palace. The King gave him 100,000 golden
<>coins and received from him the Gi1ta1 mantra. He began
<>reciting daily certain verses in the 16th Chapter of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some time afterwards the King one day went to an
<>open ground near his palace accompanied by soldi-
<>ers and set the elephant free from its chain. Then,
<>unheeding the entreaties of the frightened people he
<>approached the elephant, saluted it by touching its
<>cheeks and came away unhurt. He could act in this
<>fashion because of his firm faith in the efficacy of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1. And afterwards he placed his son, on the
<>throne and himself led a life of recluse repeating the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some Pura1n2as have another version of this episode.
<>Dus4s4a1sana was a servant of Khad2gaba1hu's son and he
<>attempted to catch the elephant but was killed
<>by it. He attained salvation by hearing the 17th Chap-
<>ter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Dus4s4a1sana, an idiot, betting a huge sum of money with
<>the junior mahouts of the elephant and unheeding the
<>warnings of several people once mounted the elephant.
<>Children agitated the animal and Dus4s4a1sana fell down
<>from its back. The angry animal stamped the fool to [Page264-b+ 64]
<>death, and its rage having not yet subsided it threw
<>around his bones. Dus4s4a1sana, who ended his life thus
<>was reborn as an elephant and was owned by King
<>Jayadeva of Ceylon for a long time. A great friend of
<>King Khad2gaba1hu, Jayadeva presented the elephant
<>to him. At the sight of its brothers and other relations
<>memory about its previous birth dawned on the eleph-
<>ant. And, it lived in great grief. After some days the
<>King presented the animal to a poet pleased at his
<>samasya1pu1ran2a (filling the three lines of a stanza in
<>tune with the fourth line given). The poet sold the
<>elephant to the King of Ma1lava as it got ill with
<>fever. In spite of the best treatment administered to it
<>the elephant seemed to be nearing its end. Without
<>either eating or drinking or sleeping the animal stood
<>motionless shedding tears day and night. One
<>day, the Ma1lava King visited the elephant when,
<>to the surprise of all assembled there, the elephant
<>spoke to the King thus: “Oh, King: if a brahmin
<>recites the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1 I will
<>be completely cured of my illness.”
<NI>Accordingly a brahmin was brought. As soon as he
<>chanted the Gi1ta1 and sprinkled water on its head it
<>got rid of its animalhood, ascended the divine aero-
<>plane and shone forth like Indra. The Ma1lava King
<>also began daily reciting the Bhagavadgi1ta1 and within a
<>short time afterwards attained salvation. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 8).

<>paramour, with the object of doing away with her
<>husband, on top of the ceiling of her room. He killed
<>Devada1sa while the latter was sleeping in the night.
<>Next day when people gathered at her house she gave

<>is there in the a1s4rama?’ queried the King, whereupon
<>S4akuntala1, the foster daughter of Kan2va came out, and
<>in the absence of her father welcomed the guest.
<>Enchanted by the beauty of S4akuntala1, the King
<>questioned her about her lineage and she told him the
<>story about Vis4va1mitra's love for Menaka1, and Kan2va
<>bringing up their daughter. Dus2yanta felt deep love
<>for her, and in accordance with rules prescribed in
<>Dharma s4a1stras married her in the Ga1ndharva way. He
<>also accepted her stipulation that the son born to her
<>should become the next monarch. S4akuntala1 got preg-
<>nant, and after promising that she would duly be
<>conducted to the palace Dus2yanta returned.
<NI>No sooner had Dus2yanta left the a1s4rama than Kan2va,

<>absence. Kan2va blessed S4akuntala1 that she would have
<>an excellent son, who would become an excellent
<>ruler of the world surrounded by the sea.
<NI>In due course of time S4akuntala1 delivered a son. Kan2va
<>did the rites pertaining to the birth of the child, and

<>would stand in the way of the child's welfare and pro-

<>When they reached Dus2yanta's palace and sent word to
<>him about their arrival he, pleading ignorance about

<>the child. Dus2yanta and S4akuntala1 hotly argued the
<>question. At last, when S4akuntala1, with swelling
<>emotions was about to leave the palace, a celestial voice
<>announced that Dus2yanta had, in fact, married
<>S4akuntala1, that Sarvadamana was his son and that he

<>meaning in Vis2avidya1. If a man is bitten by a snake,
<>the man who goes to the Vis2avaidya to speak to him
<>about it and bring him if necessary is called ‘du1ta’.
<>From the external signs and symbols of the du1ta and
<>from words spoken by him the vis2avaidya understands

<>survive. These signs and words of the ‘du1ta’ are called [Page265-b+ 63]
<>laks2an2as. The following are some of the important
<>du1talaks2an2as.
<NI>(1) The caste of the person bitten by the snake and
<>the caste of the du1ta.

<>is to make peace with the enemy. Vigraha is war. The
<>journey to battle is Ya1na. A1sana is, not going for war.
<>Dvaidhi1bha1va is dividing his army into two, i.e. if the [Page266-a+ 63]
<>army rose against the King, he should bring one party

<>strictly and continuously the Eka1das4i1 Vrata to obtain
<>the status of Indra. (See under Ambari1s2a). (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata). This vrata would fetch food
<>for the hungry and salvation for those who are in
<>search of it. (Agni Pura1n2a). The method of observing
<>this vrata is detailed below:
<NI>Those who observe the Eka1das4i1 vrata should be on a
<>regulated diet excluding meat and avoid sexual acts
<>on the Das4ami1 day, the day preceding Eka1das4i1. On
<>both the Eka1das4i1 days in a month one should not take
<>any food at all. The period which combines Eka1das4i1
<>with Dva1das4i1 (the twelfth day) is called Hariva1sara
<>because of the presence of Vis2n2u at that time. That
<>is a good time for doing sacred yajn5as. That day where
<>there is only a small portion of Eka1das4i1 and the rest
<>Dva1dasi1 is the best day for yajn5as. Trayodas4i1 (the
<>thirteenth day) is good for breaking the fast. The day
<>which merges Dva1das4i1 into Trayodas4i1 is the best day
<>for breaking the fast. Do not observe the Vrata on a
<>day which combines Das4ami1 with Eka1das4i1. Hell is the
<>result if one does so.
<NI>Completely abstaining from food on the Eka1das4i1 day
<>you should take food on the Dva1das4i1 day. As you take
<>your food you should pray like this: “Bhun3ks2yeham3
<>Pun2d2ari1ka1ks2a s4aran2am3 me bhava1cyuta”. (Oh, Pun2d2a-
<>ri1ka1ks2a, I am going to break my fast. Oh, Bhagavan,
<>let you be my heaven). If an Eka1das4i1 comes on a
<>Pu1yam3--Pus2ya--day in the bright half of the month that
<>day should on any account be observed. That day would
<>give the observer unlimited good result and that
<>Eka1das4i1 is qualified as Pa1pana1s4ini1 (destroyer of all
<>evils). When Eka1das4i1 and Dva1das4i1 happen to combine
<>on a Tiruvon2am (S4ra1van2a) day the Eka1das4i1 is qualified
<>as Vijaya1. That day gives prosperity to devotees. It is
<>also called Vijaya1 if an Eka1das4i1 comes in the month
<>of Pha1lguna (March) on a Pu1yam3 (Pus2ya) day. The
<>wise extol this day as one promising crores of good effects.
<>On the Eka1das4i1 day you should do Vis2n2u Pu1ja1 which
<>is productive of universal happiness. He who does so
<>will acquire children and wealth in this world and
<>attain Vis2n2uloka on death. (Chapter 178, Agni
<>Pura1n2a)
<HI>EKA1DAS4ENDRIYA(S). S4rotra, Tvak, Caks2us, Jihva1,

<HI>EKALAVYA I. Son of Hiran2yadhanus, a King of the
<>foresters. He went to Dron2a1ca1rya to learn archery.
<>Dron2a1ca1rya refused to accept him as a disciple because
<>he was a S4u1dra. Undaunted he went to the forests,
<>made a replica of the preceptor in clay and standing
<>before it started practising archery. Soon he became a
<>matchless archer.
<NI>Some time later the Pa1n2d2avas went to the forests for
<>hunting. One of the hunting dogs wandering saw
<>Ekalavya and started barking. Ekalavya sent seven
<>arrows to its mouth and kept it open. When the dog
<>returned to Arjuna he was dumbfounded at the skill
<>of the archer and when he came to know the archer
<>was an unknown disciple of Dron2a his disappointment
<>knew no bounds. Dron2a had once declared that Arjuna
<>was the best and topmost of his disciples. Arjuna went
<>and complained to Dron2a1ca1rya. Dron2a1ca1rya called
<>Ekalavya to his side and asked him to give him as
<>‘Gurudaks2in2a1’ (fee to the preceptor) his right-hand
<>thumb. Without the least hesitation Ekalavya offered
<>his thumb to the guru and from that day onwards his
<>skill faded and he became inferior to Arjuna. (Chapter

<HI>EKATA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} An ancient sage. He was the
<>son of the Mahars2i Gautama. He had two brothers,
<>Dvita and Trita.
<NI>2) {%How Ekata became a wolf by a curse.%} There is a story
<>of how Ekata and Dvita duped Trita in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata. When Gautama died Trita became the chief of
<>the three. Dvita and Ekata did not like this. Once all
<>the three were passing by a forest with a herd of cows for
<>a ya1ga. Trita was walking ahead and the other two were
<>following him with the cows. At a strategic point on the
<>way the brothers carried away the cows by a separate
<>route without the knowledge of Trita. When Trita
<>came to know of the loss he was greatly distressed. On
<>reaching the shores of the river Sarasvati1, he was frigh-
<>tened by a wolf and running to escape from the animal
<>fell into a dilapidated well. He performed a ya1ga from
<>where he lay. Assuming a creeper inside the well to be
<>Somalata1, Trita recited the R2ks and the devas responded
<>to his prayer. Devas like Br2haspati graciously appeared
<>before him and asked him to demand a boon from
<>them. Trita replied that his desire was to worship the
<>gods standing on the waves of the river Sarasvati1.
<>Accordingly the river was made to flow that way and
<>standing on the waves Trita worshipped the gods. After
<>that he went home and cursed his brothers and made
<>Ekata and Dvita into wolves.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}

<HI>EKAVI1RA
<F>1. The genealogy of Ekavi1ra is stated differently in different Pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata states that Ekavi1ra is the son of Turvasu,
<>son of Yaya1ti and that he is the father of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. It is not correct. The genealogy chronicled here is based on Agni and Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2as. According to that Yadu, son of Yaya1ti is the father of the grandfather of Ekavi1ra: Yadu--Sahasrajit--Satajit--Hehaya (Ekavi1ra).
<>Descending from Ekavi1ra--Dharma--Kun2i--Bhadrasena--Dhanaka--Krtavi1ra--Ka1rtavi1rva1rjuna. From the grandson of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna,
<>Vr2s2n2i, starts the Vr2s2n2i dynasty.</F> (HEHAYA). A founder of the Hehaya
<>line of kings.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u: Atri--
<>Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Yaya1ti--Yadu--
<>Sahasrajit--S4atajit--Ekavi1ra (Hehaya).
<NI>2) {%Birth of Ekavi1ra.%} Once there was a King called
<>Revanta who was an intimate friend of Indra. One day
<>riding on Uccaih2s4ravas, Indra's horse, he went to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. Fascinated by the arresting beauty of
<>Revanta, Maha1laks2mi1 sat gaping for a while and did
<>not hear what Vis2n2u talked to her. Vis2n2u was offended
<>and lost his temper. Laks2mi1 was looking with interest
<>alternatively at Revanta and the horse when Vis2n2u
<>cursed her to be born as a mare on earth. Horrified,
<>shedding tears, Laks2mi1 begged for relief. Vis2n2u decreed
<>that she would return to Vaikun2t2ha after giving birth
<>to a son who would be equal in glory to Vis2n2u himself.
<>Maha1laks2mi1 came to Earth taking the shape of a mare
<>and lived in a forest situated at a point where the rivers
<>Ka1lindi1 and Tamasa1 meet and where once Su1ryapatni1
<>stayed and did penance. Meditating on S4iva she lived
<>there for a thousand divine years and then one day
<>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 appeared before her and asked her
<>what she wanted. She then said “Oh, Bhagavan, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u cursed me and made me into a mare. He has
<>decreed that I would go back after bringing forth a son
<>as glorious as Vis2n2u. From whom am I to bear a son
<>like this?” S4iva promised to find a solution and going to
<>Vaikun2t2ha sent Vis2n2u to earth in the form of a horse.
<>Vis2n2u came to Laks2mi1 and they lived together for some
<>time and soon a son was born to Laks2mi1. Leaving the
<>child in the forest both of them went back to Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. It is this child who later on became the famous
<>King, Ekavi1ra. It was because he was born of a horse
<>that he got the names, Hehaya and Haihaya. (Skandha
<>6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How Ekavi1ra came to the palace.%} It was at this time that
<>S4atajit, son of the grandson of Yaya1ti was doing
<>penance to obtain a son. He was also doing penance
<>in the forest situated at a point where the rivers Ka1lindi1
<>and Tamasa1 meet. One night a Vidya1dhara named
<>Campaka came with a Vidya1dhari1 named Mada1lasa1
<>and seeing the infant lying helpless in the forest took
<>it to Devaloka. Indra recognised it as the child born to
<>Vis2n2u and Laks2mi1 on earth while they were living as
<>horse and mare and so the Vidya1dhara put it back on
<>earth in the same place as before. Immediately Laks2mi1-
<>Na1ra1yan2as appeared before S4atajit doing penance there
<>and asking him to take care of a child lying helpless in
<>another side of the forest disappeared. Immensely
<>pleased at this S4atajit took the child to his palace and
<>brought him forth as his own son giving the child the
<>name Ekavi1ra. When the boy became a prince, S4atajit
<>crowned Ekavi1ra King and went to the forest with his
<>queen and after doing penance there for sometime
<>attained Vis2n2uloka. (Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Ekavi1ra marries Eka1vali1.%} Once Prince Ekavi1ra
<>accompanied by the son of the minister went for a plea-
<>sure trip to the banks of the river Gan3ga1. It was spring
<>and the prince wandering about enjoying the sight of a [Page269-b+ 60]
<>flowery forest was soon arrested by the sight of a
<>sweet smelling lotus with a hundred petals blooming in
<>the river. By the side of the lotus was standing a
<>beautiful damsel weeping. The prince went to her and
<>asked her the reason for her weeping. After great per-
<>suasion she replied thus: “Oh, Prince, there is a country
<>not far from yours which is now being ruled over by a
<>very righteous King called Raibhya. His queen is called
<>Rukmarekha1. They had no children for a very long
<>time and so Raibhya conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i ya1ga.
<>When ghee was poured profusely into the sacrificial fire
<>the flames rose up to great heights and from inside the
<>flames came out a lovely maiden. The King named her
<>Eka1vali1 and bought her forth as his daughter. I am
<>Yas4ovati1 the daughter of the minister there. We were
<>of the same age and so I was asked to live with her as
<>her companion. She was very fond of lotuses and the
<>King constructed big ponds with lotuses in them for
<>her recreation. Yet she used to go to other ponds also
<>in search of lotuses.
<NI>One day we came to this side of the river Gan3ga1 to
<>play. Then a demon of name Ka1laketu came and kidnapp-
<>ed her. I followed her. She never surrendered to the
<>enticements and persuasions of Ka1laketu. Her father
<>wanted her to be married to Ekavi1ra, King of Hehaya.
<>Ka1laketu sent her to prison. Without knowing what to
<>do next I am standing here weeping.
<NI>Hearing this Ekavi1ra went to Pa1ta1la and defeating
<>Ka1laketu released Eka1vali1 and brought both Eka1vali1
<>and Yas4ovati1 to the palace of Raibhya. Pleased at this
<>Raibhya gave his daughter in marriage to Ekavi1ra.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was born in the family of Ekavi1ra.
<>(Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>ELA1PUTRA. A serpent born to Kas4yapa of his wife
<>Kadru1. This serpent was very intelligent. Once there
<>arose a dispute between Vinata1 and Kadru1 over the
<>colour of the tail of the horse of Indra, Uccaih2s4ravas.
<>Kadru1 argued that there were black hairs in the tail
<>while Vinata1 held there were none. Really there were
<>no black hairs and Kadru1 to win the argument wanted
<>her sons to go and hang on the hairs to create a black
<>colour. The serpents like Va1suki and others refused to
<>do so and Kadru1 then cursed them saying that they
<>would all be burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
<>Janamejaya. To take measures to get free from this
<>curse a meeting of the serpents under the leadership of
<>S4es2a and Va1suki was held and in that assembly Ela1-
<>putra made a stirring speech. (Chapter 38, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>ELI AND PU1CCA. (Eli = rat, Pu1cca = Cat).
<NI>The story of the cat and the rat described by the poet
<>Kun5jan Nambia1r is from Katha1saritsa1gara. The story
<>in original is the following.
<NI>Once there lived on a big banyan tree near the city of
<>Vidis4a1 a mongoose, an owl, a cat and a rat. The mon-
<>goose and the rat lived in two separate hollows at the
<>foot of the tree, the cat in a cavity in the centre of the
<>tree and the owl on the branches at the top. Of these
<>the rat could be eaten by all the other three and the cat
<>could kill all the rest. The rat and the mongoose afraid [Page270-a+ 64]
<>of the cat did stir out only during night time and the
<>cat moved about day and night afraid of none wishing
<>to catch hold of the rat and eat it. Their common place
<>of activity was a rice-field nearby.
<NI>Once a forester laid a net to catch the cat and the cat
<>fell into the trap and lay there hanging inside the net.
<>The rat coming that way saw the plight of the cat and
<>jumped with joy. But soon the owl and the mongoose
<>came to the spot and seeing their enemy, the cat, impr2i-
<>soned rushed to catch hold of the rat. The rat then did
<>a very clever thing. It went and tore open the net
<>imprisoning the cat and when the cat jumped out of the
<>net the owl and the mongoose ran away and disappear-
<>ed. The rat went to its hole. This is a story to
<>demonstrate the fact that with a change in the situation
<>an enemy may turn out to be a friend. (Taran3ga 7,
<>Madanaman5cuka1lam3baka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>ELLU. An oil seed. (Sesame). Ellu originated from
<>the body of Kas4yapa. Because Ellu is born of the body
<>of Kas4yapa, King of R2s2is, it is considered as divine to
<>offer Ellu to anybody. (S4loka 10, Chapter 66, Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva).

<>known as Gada1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 114).
<HI>GADA I. A brother (Ya1dava) of Balabhadrara1ma.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Vasudeva had, besides Devaki1, seven wives
<>called Rohin2i1, Bhadra1, Ma1lini1, Madira1, Ila1, Rocana1
<>and Pauravi1, and out of the seven Rohin2i1 had six sons
<>called Balabhadrara1ma, Gada, Sa1ran2a, Durdama,
<>Vikala and Kr2ta. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Gada was present at the svayam3vara of Draupadi1.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 32).
<NI>(2) On the marriage of Arjuna with Subhadra1,

<NI>(8) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a felt uncontrollably angry when Gada
<>was attacked during the mutual fighting with iron rods
<>by the Ya1davas which climaxed in their total annihila-
<>tion. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 45).
<HI>GADA II. See Gada.
<HI>GADA1DHARA. A synonym of Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>There is a place called Gaya1 to the north of Mount
<>Ka1lan5jara to the south of Hima1layas, to the east of

<>medha (yajn5a at which man is offered as sacrifice) and
<>a Maha1medha and Maha1vis2n2u acted as gate-keeper of
<>Gaya. As Vis2n2u stood guard there holding the gada1

<>bha1rata. (See Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>GADA1VASA1NA. A particular centre in Madhura1puri1.

<>Kr2s2n2a killed Kam3sa, his father-in-law Jara1sandha got
<>so angry that he hurled his gada1 (club) ninetynine
<>times at Madhura1puri1 from his capital, Girivraja. The
<>spot where the gada1 finally fell came to be called Gada1-
<>vasa1na in course of time. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>18, Verses 22-25).
<HI>GA1DHI I. Father of Vis4va1mitra.

<>Kus4ana1bha had hundred daughters by his wife Ghr2ta1ci1,
<>an Apsara1 woman. He felt very sad that he had no
<>sons. At last he performed the Putraka1mes2t2i yajn5a,
<>and Ga1dhi was born to him.
<NI>3) {%Ga1dhi's children.%} A son named Vis4va1mitra and a
<>daughter called Satyavati1 were born to Ga1dhi. Satya-
<>vati1 was married to sage R2ci1ka. After the wedding of
<>his daughter Ga1dhi crowned Vis4va1mitra as the king
<>and left for the forest for tapas. During his stay in the
<>forest Ga1dhi was put up in the a1s4rama of R2ci1ka for a

<>due to the curse of Agastya and his attaining heaven.
<>(See under Indradyumna).
<HI>GA1LAVA. A celebrated sage.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He was a son of Vis4va1mitra. He was a
<>brahmava1di1. (S4loka 52, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana Parva.
<NI>2) {%How he got his name.%} There is no record of his origi-
<>nal name in any of the Pura1n2as. He got his name
<>Ga1lava later. There is a story about this both in Devi1-
<>bha1gavata and Harivam3s4a. It is as follows:
<NI>There was once a King called Arun2a in the family of
<>Ma1ndha1ta1. Arun2a got a son and he was named Satya-
<>vrata. (It was this Satyavrata who later became the well
<>famed Tris4an3ku). When Satyavrata was a youngster
<>he once went inside the marriage hall of a brahmin and
<>kidnapped the bride. Furious at this evil deed of his
<>son the king sent him out from his palace and Satyavrata
<>roamed about aimlessly.
<NI>Nature protested against this deed of the King abandon-
<>ing his heir and there was no rain in the country for
<>twelve years. The people were all put to great trouble.
<>Among those who suffered were the wife and children
<>of Vis4va1mitra. Vis4va1mitra had at that time gone to
<>the shores of the river Kaus4iki1, for doing penance. The
<>family of Vis4va1mitra was in great distress living without
<>any means for food. The sight of the children crying
<>for food to appease their hunger pained their mother
<>much. So she decided to sell one child and feed the
<>others by what she got from the sale. It was better to
<>be without one child than all the children dying out of
<>hunger.
<NI>She made a rope out of darbha leaves and tying it round
<>the neck of one child took it to the market for sale.
<>Both the mother and child were weeping profusely on
<>their way. Satyavrata saw them and took pity on them.
<>When Satyavrata heard their sad story and knew that
<>the woman was the wife of Vis4va1mitra he told her
<>thus: “Oh, Venerable Lady, you need not sell this boy.
<>Untie the rope round his neck and throw it away. I
<>will look after your family till the return of your hus-
<>band. I will daily bring food for you all and hang it
<>on a tree near your a1s4rama.”
<NI>The mother was extremely happy to hear this and she
<>at once untied the rope round the neck of the boy and
<>the boy from thence became known as Ga1lava. (For
<>details see under Tris4an3ku).
<NI>3) {%Gurudaks2in2a1 of Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava continued his educa-
<>tion under his father. At that time Dharmadeva to [Page272-a+ 64]
<>test Vis4va1mitra came to him disguised as Vasis2t2ha.
<>Vis4va1mitra came out with rice to receive the guest but
<>by that time the guest had disappeared. But Vis4va1-
<>mitra remained there with the rice for hundred years
<>till Dharmadeva returned. All these years Ga1lava looked
<>after Vis4va1mitra's comforts. Vis4va1mitra was immensely
<>pleased with Ga1lava and allowed him to go away free
<>without any gurudaks2in2a1 when his education was over.
<>Ga1lava wanted to give some daks2in2a1 but Vis4va1mitra
<>refused to accept it. Ga1lava insisted on giving and then
<>Vis4va1mitra asked him to give whatever he liked but
<>Ga1lava wanted the Daks2in2a1 to be named. Disgusted
<>with this stubbornness Vis4va1mitra said “Go and get me
<>eight hundred horses each with one of its ears black”.
<>Ga1lava was shocked to hear the demand and greatly
<>worried roamed about in search of horses of the type
<>specified. Garud2a taking pity on his sad plight took
<>him to the palace of Yaya1ti. Hearing the story of
<>Ga1lava Yaya1ti sent his daughter Ma1dhavi1 with Ga1lava
<>saying that if she was given in marriage to any king he
<>would give him the eight hundred horses of the type
<>he required.
<NI>Ga1lava took Ma1dhavi1 to Haryas4va, a King of the
<>Iks2va1ku line of Kings. Haryas4va was doing penance
<>at that time to obtain a child. Ga1lava said that Har-
<>yas4va would get a son of Ma1dhavi1 and he should,
<>therefore, accept Ma1dhavi1 and give him in return eight
<>hundred horses each with one ear black. Haryas4va was
<>amenable to the terms but the only difficulty was that
<>he had only two hundred horses of the type specified.
<>Finding this difficulty Ma1dhavi1 said “Oh, Ga1lava
<>please do not worry on that account. I have a boon from
<>a brahmava1di1 sage that I would remain a maiden
<>even after delivery. So give me in marriage to this
<>King and get two hundred horses. After giving birth
<>to a son to this King take me to another King and
<>get two hundred horses from him and then to another and
<>thus by giving me to four Kings you can get the eight
<>hundred horses you require.”
<NI>Ga1lava liked this plan and so when Ma1dhavi1 gave
<>birth to a son he took her to Divoda1sa, Ra1ja1 of Ka1s4i1.
<>When a son was born to him Ga1lava took her to Us4i1nara,
<>King of Bhoja. Ga1lava thus got six hundred horses but
<>there was nobody else to give him the remaining two
<>hundred. When Ga1lava was contemplating as to what
<>he should do next Garud2a came to his rescue. He
<>advised Ga1lava to give six hundred horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses to Vis4va1-
<>mitra. Ga1lava gave Vis4va1mitra the horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>and pleased with the gurudaks2in2a1 Vis4va1mitra
<>blessed Ga1lava. Vis4va1mitra got a son named As2t2aka
<>of Madhavi1. (See under As2t2aka).
<NI>4) {%Ga1lava and Citrasena.%} Ga1lava was once having his even-
<>ing prayers in the river when the spittings from the mouth
<>of Citrasena who was travelling by air above fell on
<>the pu1ja1 materials of Ga1lava. Ga1lava went and com-
<>plained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of this and Kr2s2n2a in haste pro-
<>mised to bring before Ga1lava the head of Citrasena
<>before the sun set. Na1rada who heard this went and
<>informed Citrasena of Kr2s2n2a's vow. Citrasena was
<>frightened to death. But Na1rada asked him not to lose
<>hope and advised Sandhya1 and Vali1, wives of Citra-
<>sena, to approach Subhadra1, sister of Kr2s2n2a, for pro-
<>tection. Both of them went to Subhadra1 and made a [Page272-b+ 64]
<>grand fire-pit in front of her palace. Citrasena decided
<>to end his life by jumping into the fire and as he was
<>circling the pit his wives wept loudly. Since her hus-
<>band Arjuna was away from the palace Subhadra1 her-
<>self ran to the place from where she heard the cries.
<>When they saw Subhadra1 they begged for ‘Man3galya-
<>bhiks2a1’ (a boon to live with one's husband). Subhadra1
<>agreed to give them that. Then she heard their story
<>in full and only then did she realise that she had under-
<>taken to do the impossible. Yet, to help Subhadra1,
<>Arjuna agreed to protect Citrasena. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>attacked Citrasena Arjuna defended. The fight then
<>ensued between Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a. Both had very
<>powerful and divine weapons and the world stood on
<>the verge of a collapse by their fight. Then Subhadra1
<>did a brave thing. She stood between the two and
<>requested for a cease-fire. Then S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a asked Citra-
<>sena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava. Ga1lava
<>pardoned him. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Tapoda1na.%} Ga1lava once gave Yaya1ti one eighth
<>portion of the goodness accrued to him by his long
<>penance. (See Yaya1ti for details).
<NI>6) {%Ga1lava gets a horse.%} Pa1ta1laketu, a demon, used to
<>give trouble to Ga1lava daily while he used to do
<>penance. Once this demon sent a deep hot breath to
<>the sky and then a horse fell from the sky. Soon an
<>unknown voice from air said, “This is a very strong
<>horse and it would travel many a yojana in an hour.”
<>Ga1lava took that horse and gave it to R2tadhvaja.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 59).
<NI>7) {%Other details regarding Ga1lava.%}
<NI>(i) He was an intimate friend of King Prati1pa. (S4loka
<>13, Chapter 20, Harivam3s4a).

<>Chapter 46, Verse 3).
<HI>GAN2AM. An army division. Three Gulmas form one
<>Gan2am. (See Aks2auhin2i1).
<HI>GAN2APATI.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A son of S4iva with face like that of an
<>elephant. As S4iva has appointed this son as chief of
<>the gan2as (attendants) he is called Gan2apati.
<NI>2) {%His birth.%} While S4iva and Pa1rvati1 assumed the form
<>of monkeys and enjoyed themselves in the forest Pa1rvati1
<>got pregnant, and S4iva took the semen from the womb
<>and gave it to Va1yu (wind God.) Va1yu deposited it in
<>the womb of An5jana1, who delivered a son named Hanu1-
<>ma1n. S4iva assumed the form of an elephant (tusker) [Page273-a+ 64]
<>and Pa1rvati1 that of a she-elephant. Pa1rvati1 delivered a
<>son in the form of an elephant. That son was named
<>Gan2apati. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%His tusk broken.%} Once Paras4ura1ma arrived at Kaila1sa
<>to meet S4iva. At that time S4iva was asleep. So Gan2a-
<>pati did not allow him to get in. A duel broke out
<>between them. In that duel one of Gan2apati's tusks
<>was broken. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%Gan2apati turned into crow.%} An exceptionally hot
<>summer set in once in South India. The whole land
<>became parched. So Agastya went to S4iva and request-
<>ed for some holy water, and the Lord put Ka1veri1 who
<>was worshipping him just then, in the Kaman2d2alu
<>(something like a teapot which sannya1sins carry with
<>them) of Agastya and sent him back. Indra, who did
<>not relish this action of S4iva, asked Gan2apati to some
<>how or other upset Agastya's Kaman2d2alu of holy water,
<>and Gan2apati, in the guise of a crow went and sat on
<>the brink of the Kaman2d2alu and thus upset it. Agastya
<>and the crow quarrelled with each other. Then did the
<>crow assume its original form as Gan2apati and blessed
<>Agastya. Moreover, Gan2apati filled Agastya's Kaman2-
<>d2alu with holy water, which the latter distributed
<>among devotees in South India, and that is the present
<>Ka1veri1 river.
<NI>5) {%Other stories about Gan2apati's head.%} The Pura1n2as
<>contain two different stories as to how Gan2apati hap-
<>pened to have the elephant's head. Once Pa1rvati1
<>pointed out to Gan2apati the planet Saturn, and his head
<>got burned down due to the ocular power of Saturn,
<>and according to one story Gan2apati's head thus lost
<>was replaced with that of an elephant. The other story
<>is more interesting. When once S4iva tried to enter the
<>room where Pa1rvati1 had gone to take her bath clad in
<>a single clothing Gan2apati prevented S4iva from doing
<>so. S4iva, enraged at the obstruction made by Gan2apati,
<>cut off his head, and when his anger was cooled down
<>he replaced Gan2apati's lost head with that of an ele-
<>phant. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%Wedding of Gan2apati.%} Gan2apati has two wives called
<>Siddhi and Buddhi.
<NI>When Gan2apati and Subrahman2ya attained the age of
<>marriage they were in a hurry to get married. S4iva
<>conducted a test. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 told them that he
<>who returned first after going round the world would be
<>married first. Accordingly Subrahman2ya mounted his
<>vehicle (peacock) and set out for a tour round the
<>world. Gan2apati did nothing of the sort. But after a
<>little time he went round his parents, viz., S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1. Asked for an explanation about his action
<>Gan2apati replied that since the whole universe existed
<>in S4iva and Pa1rvati1, going around them tantamounted
<>to touring round the world. Pleased at this reply his
<>parents got Gan2apati married first.
<NI>7) {%Vighnes4varatvam.%} (Power to remove all obstacles).
<>Gan2apati is called Vighnes4vara because he is the god
<>who removes all obstacles from the paths of men or
<>creates them.
<NI>Gan2apati has the power to get anything done without
<>any obstructions as also the power to put obstacles in
<>the path of anything being got done. Therefore, the
<>custom came into vogue of worshipping Gan2apati at the
<>very commencement of any action for its completion
<>without any hitch or hindrance. Actions begun with [Page273-b+ 64]
<>such worship would be duly completed, Indians believe.
<>In support of that belief the following story from the
<>6th taran3ga of La1va1n2akalam3bakam, Katha1saritsa1gara
<>may be quoted.
<NI>The Devas decided to appoint Subrahman2ya as chief
<>of the army to kill Ta1raka1sura. When Indra took up
<>the pot of water purified by mantras to anoint Subrah-
<>man2ya's head with it, his hands became benumbed, and
<>he stood aghast. Then S4iva said that any action begun
<>without Gan2apati pu1ja1 would meet with such obstacles.
<>At once Indra worshipped Gan2apati and his hands
<>recovered from the paralysed condition. And, Subrah-
<>man2ya was duly anointed with the holy water.
<NI>8) {%Gan2apati wrote the M3aha1bha1rata.%} After the death of
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas sage Vya1sa entered
<>again into meditation. But, the whole story of the
<>Bha1rata reflected in the mirror of his mind. He wanted
<>to translate the story into a great poem and requested
<>Brahma1 to suggest a suitable person to write the story
<>on his dictation, and Brahma1 suggested Gan2apati's
<>name. Then Vya1sa thought about Gan2apati and he
<>appeared before the sage. But, Gan2apati did not appre-
<>ciate the idea of serving as Vya1sa's scribe. So he stipu-
<>lated a condition that he would write down the poem
<>provided Vya1sa dictated it in such a manner that he
<>had not to lay down his pen even once before the epic
<>was completed. To this Vya1sa stipulated the counter
<>condition that when he dictated without the least inter-
<>ruption or pause Gan2apati should not write down the
<>matter without understanding the meaning of it. And,
<>under such conditions the composition of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata was completed within three years. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verses 74-80).
<NI>9) {%Gan2apati pu1ja.%} Gan2apati occupies the most promi-
<>nent place among the Devas connected with S4iva. In
<>South India, Gan2apati pu1ja1 came into vogue in the 6th
<>century A.D., and idols of Gan2apati now extant might
<>have been made at that period. In South India, temples
<>dedicated to Gan2apati are in no way less in number
<>than those to Subrahman2ya. The idol of Gan2apati is
<>installed at the gateways of villages and forts, under
<>the fig tree, at the entrance of temples and at the south-
<>western corner of S4iva temples. Two types of idols are
<>important: the Itam3piri (the proboscis turned to the
<>left side) and the Valam3piri (the proboscis turned to
<>the right side). It is stated that the enormously big
<>belly of Gan2apati contains in it the whole universe.

<HI>GA1NDHA1RA. A stretch of land of ancient Bha1rata. It
<>is believed that this land stretched from the shores of
<>river Sindhu to Ka1bul. Subala was a mighty ruler of
<>this country. His daughter Ga1ndha1ri1 was the wife of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (S4loka 11, Chapter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>Agni Pura1n2a points out a relationship between the
<>Ga1ndha1ras and the Dra1vid2as. Descending in order from

<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1NDHA1RI1. Wife of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There was a King called Subala in the family
<>of Turvasu, brother of Yadu. (For genealogy see under
<>Subala). Subala became the King of the land of Ga1n-
<>dha1ra. This land extended from the river Sindhu to
<>Ka1bul. Ga1ndha1ri1 was the daughter of Subala. (Chap-
<>ter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Ga1ndha1ri1 became a devotee of S4iva even
<>from her childhood. S4iva became pleased with her and
<>blessed her saying that she would bear a hundred sons.
<>Bhi1s2ma came to know of this and he planned to get her
<>married to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. One day he sent a messenger
<>to Subala making a proposal. Subala knew that Dhr2-
<>tara1s2t2ra was born blind but considering his lineage and
<>the powerful alliance it would make, consented to the
<>proposal of Bhi1s2ma. S4akuni, brother of Ga1ndha1ri1, then
<>by the order of his father took Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1-
<>pura and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted her as his wife. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 obeying his father's instructions without a demur
<>accepted her blind husband with such devotion that
<>she made herself blind by tightly covering her eyes
<>with a silk shawl. (Chapter 110, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Birth of Sons.%} Once Vya1sa came to her exhausted
<>with hunger and thirst. Ga1ndha1ri1 appeased his hunger
<>and thirst with tasty things to eat and drink. Vya1sa
<>was immensely pleased and he also blessed her and
<>said she would get a hundred sons. Very soon she be-
<>came pregnant. But even after two years she did not
<>deliver, while Kunti1, wife of Pa1n2d2u, gave birth to a
<>son. Grief-stricken, she hit hardly on her womb secretly
<>and then a great mass of flesh came out. Then Vya1sa
<>appeared before her and advised her to cut the lump
<>of flesh into a hundred pieces and deposit one each in
<>a jar of ghee. Vya1sa himself cut it into pieces. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 expressed a desire to have a girl also. Vya1sa cut
<>it into hundred and one pieces and put them in hundred [Page275-a+ 65]
<>and one jars of ghee. In due time the jars broke and
<>a hundred sons and a daughter came out of the jars.
<>The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1. For their name see
<>‘Kauravas’. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra got another son named Yuyu-
<>tsu. (Chapters 115 and 116, A1di Parva).
<NI>4) {%Ga1ndhari1 faints.%} When San5jaya reported about the
<>death of Karn2a at the battle both Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 fainted. (S4loka 55, Chapter 96, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>5) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 starts to curse the Pa1n2d2avas.%} When the battle
<>was over the sons of Ga1ndha1ri1 and their followers were
<>killed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra suggested that the Pa1n2d2avas should
<>visit Ga1ndha1ri1 and pay homage to her. The Pa1n2d2avas,
<>therefore, went and stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 very res-
<>pectfully. Vengeance boiled in her heart and her body
<>shivered. Ga1ndha1ri1 was about to curse the Pa1n2d2avas
<>when Vya1sa, intervened saying “Ga1ndha1ri1! Don't you
<>remember you said that victory would lie on the side
<>of the righteous in this war? Your words are not wasted.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas won the battle because right was on
<>their side. So why should you get agitated?” Ga1ndha1ri1
<>became calm on hearing these words and she admitted
<>that the end of the Kuru dynasty came because of the
<>mistakes of Duryodhana, S4akuni, Karn2a and Dus4s4a1-
<>sana. She, thereafter, treated the Pa1n2d2avas as her own
<>sons. (Chapter 14, Stri1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's foot-nails become blue.%} Following the
<>instructions of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, the Pa1n2d2avas, approached
<>and bowed before Ga1ndha1ri1. She covered her face
<>with a cloth and wept, tears rolling down her cheeks.
<>When Dharmaputra bent to touch her feet the latter
<>saw through the veil on her face the foot-nails of
<>Dharmaputra. A few drops of the lachrymal water fell
<>on the foot-nails of Dharmaputra making them turn
<>blue instantly. (Chapter 15, Stri1 Parva).
<NI>7) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 curses Kr2s2n2a.%} At the end of the battle the
<>aggrieved Ga1ndha1ri1 went to Kuruks2etra together with
<>Kr2s2n2a and other relatives. Seeing mighty Kings on the
<>Kaurava side lying dead like huge trees lying truncated
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 burst into tears. She knew that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was at the root of all this. Embittered she looked at
<>Kr2s2n2a and cursed him. “Ho, Kr2s2n2a, thirtysix years
<>from this day you will lose your sons, ministers, friends
<>and relatives. You will become a lone walker in the
<>forests and be killed by trickery.”
<NI>It was because of this curse that the Ya1dava tribe perish-
<>ed and Kr2s2n2a was struck by the arrow of a hunter
<>which made him end his life on earth.
<NI>8) {%The end of Ga1ndha1ri1.%} After the great Kuruks2etra battle
<>heart-broken Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied
<>by Kunti1, Vidura and San5jaya went to the forests to
<>spend the rest of their life there. Many people and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas accompanied them up to the river Gan3ga1 and
<>there near the a1s4rama of S4atayu1pa Dhr2tara1s2t2ra made
<>a hut and lived with Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas felt the separation of their relatives
<>unbearable and lived in grief. After six years one day
<>Dharmaputra saw his mother, Kunti1, in a dream. He
<>told his brothers about this and they all felt a desire
<>to go to the forest and see their mother. The next day they
<>reached the shores of Gan3ga1. Vya1sa also joined them.
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 expressed a desire to Vya1sa that
<>they would like to see the dead sons and relatives once
<>again. Vya1sa then asked them to go and take a dip
<>in the river. When they rose up after a dip they saw [Page275-b+ 65]
<>standing on the shores of the river the great warriors
<>Karn2a and Duryodhana and others. By the yogic power
<>of Vya1sa even the blind Dhr2tara1s2t2ra could get the vision.
<>Very soon the vision faded and the Pa1n2d2avas returned
<>to Hastina1pura.
<NI>Two days after, fire broke out in the forest where
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was staying. Dhr2tara1s2tra, Kunti1 and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 were burnt to death in that fire. (Chapter 32,
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>9) {%After the death.%} Dharmaputra performed the obsequi-
<>es of those who died in the wild fire (A1s4ramava1sika
<>Parva, Chapter 30). Leaving the mortal bodies the souls of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 entered Kuberaloka. (S4loka

<HI>GANDHARVANAGARA. Vya1sa has compared munis
<>disappearing from sight to the fading out of Gandharva

<>they were looking on, the band of sages disappeared
<>in a trice like the fading out of Gandharvanagara.”

<NI>What is this Gandharvanagara? The following descrip-
<>tion occurs in Hindi S4abdasa1gara. “Owing to different
<>optical illusions (sight) of man, villages and cities may
<>appear to exist in the sky and also on seas, rivers, etc.
<>When during summer the air on the upper strata of
<>deserts, seas etc. gets heated, expanded, and rises up,
<>the light passing through it becomes multi-coloured and
<>gives reflections in the sky in the form of village parts or
<>cities. Also can be seen therein reflections of trees,

<>also. This is a mere optical illusion. This reflection
<>immediately fades out also. This unreal city which is

<>After that Candra kept it for 500 years with him, and

<>years.
<NI>4) {%Ga1n2d2i1va and Arjuna.%} Arjuna agreed to protect the
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest from rain, if Indra sent rain when

<>hilated and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a entered maha1sama1dhi. Now the
<>Pa1n2d2avas lost all interest in mundane life, and they
<>set out for the forest on their great journey after crown-
<>ing Pari1ks2it, the grandson of Arjuna as King. Their
<>great travel took them to the shores of the Red Sea.
<>The Ga1n2d2i1va was still in Arjuna's hands. On the shores
<>of the Red Sea Agni Deva appeared before the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas and spoke to them “Well, Pa1n2d2avas, I am Agni
<>Deva. Arjuna requires the Ga1n2d2i1va no more. I got it
<>from Varun2a for Arjuna. Return it, therefore, to
<>Varun2a.”
<NI>No sooner did he hear Agni Deva speak thus than did
<>Arjuna throw it into the depths of the sea and also the
<>quiver which never got exhausted of arrows with it.
<>Agni Deva disappeared, and the Pa1n2d2avas continued
<>their journey. (Maha1prastha1nika Parva, Chapter 1).
<HI>GAN3GA1. The famous and holy river of India.
<NI>1) {%Origin and general information.%} Gan3ga1 had its origin
<>during the incarnation of Vis2n2u as Va1mana. When
<>Va1mana measured the three worlds in three steps the
<>nails on his left feet were raised high. They caused a
<>pore on the upper side of the universe. Gan3ga1, starting
<>from the finger of Vis2n2u's feet fell in heaven (Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>The famous Vis2n2upadi1, the flowing water (ti1rtha) of
<>which washes away the sins of the people in the universe
<>is the very same Gan3ga1 under discussion. For many
<>yugas (eras) this river confined itself to the heights of
<>the sky, otherwise called Vis2n2upada. This particular
<>spot is known as Dhruvaman2d2ala as it is here that
<>Dhruva, son of King Utta1napa1da, does, his penance.
<>The seven sages who constantly go round and round
<>the Dhruvaman2d2ala take their bath in this holy river.
<>The course of the river is thus: starting from Vis2n2upada
<>it falls on devaya1na glittering with crores of vima1nas
<>and therefrom it descends on Candraman2d2ala which it
<>submerges. It follows its course again from there divid-
<>ing itself into four tributaries called Si1ta1, Caks2us,
<>Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and then falls in Brahmaloka
<>wherefrom it flows in all directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries Si1ta1 falls on the head of Mount Meru, flows down
<>to Gandhama1dana, then circling through Bhadra1s4va
<>vars2a falls into the eastern sea. Caks2us falls on the
<>peaks of mount Ma1lyava1n, flows through Ketuma1la
<>and falls into the western sea. Alakananda1 falls on
<>mount Hemaku1t2a, flows through Bha1rata Vars2a and falls
<>into the southern sea. And Bhadra1 falls on the head
<>of mount S4r2n3gava1n flows through Uttarakuru and falls
<>into the northern sea. Alakananda1 flows through
<>Bha1rata Vars2a and is regarded as the most sacred of the
<>four tributaries.
<NI>Gan3ga1 which flowed through heaven fell on the earth
<>after thousands of years of its origin. (Bha1gavata,
<>Pan5cama, Skandha, Chapter 17).
<NI>2) {%Why Gan3ga1 became S4iva's consort.%} Maha1vis2n2u was
<>once engaged at Vaikun2t2ha in a pleasant talk with his
<>wives, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1 and Gan3ga1 when Gan3ga1 cast
<>lustful eyes on Vis2n2u, who, behind the backs of the
<>other two wives returned the lustful glances. Sarasvati1
<>could not put up with that situation for a long time.
<>Therefore, she got up from her seat and beat Gan3ga1.
<>Laks2mi1 tried to restrain Sarasvati1 lest the quarrel should
<>become fiercer. Angered at this intervention Sarasvati1
<>cursed that Laks2mi1 be born on earth. Gan3ga1 got angry
<>that innocent Laks2mi1 was thus cursed, and she in her [Page277-a+ 65]
<>turn cursed that Sarasvati1 be born as a river on earth.
<>Sarasvati1 did not take the curse lying down, but cursed
<>that Gan3ga1 also be born as a river on earth and take
<>upon herself the sins of the whole world. When all the
<>three wives of Vis2n2u got themselves thus into trouble
<>he told them as follows: “Everything has happened as
<>it should have happened. Laks2mi1 may go to the earth
<>and be born in the home of Dharmadhvaja and grow
<>up as his daughter, but not from the womb of his
<>women. There you will purify the three worlds after
<>which you will be born as the plant called tulasi1, and
<>be married by an asura called S4an3khacu1d2a, who will be
<>born as a part of me. And, after that you will be turned
<>into a sacred river called Padma1vati1, and leaving the
<>river on earth your divine form will return to Vaikun2-
<>t2ha.” And, to Gan3ga1 Vis2n2u said as follows: “You will
<>go to earth as a holy river to wash off the sins of people
<>there. A king called Bhagi1ratha will be leading you to
<>earth, and you will, therefore, be known as Bha1gi1rathi1
<>also. And, you remain there on earth as the wife of the
<>ocean of King S4antanu. Your divine form will return
<>to mount Kaila1sa as the consort of S4iva.” As for Sara-
<>svati1, Vis2n2u asked her to be born as a river on earth,
<>her divine form ultimately returning to Satyaloka and
<>then becoming the consort of Brahma1.
<NI>And, thus it was that Laks2mi1 became the consort of
<>Maha1vi1s2n2u, Gan3ga1 of S4iva and Sarasvati1 of Brahma1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Gan3ga1 born on earth due to the curse of Brahma1.%} Maha1-
<>bhis2ak, an emperor of the Iks2va1ku dynasty, went
<>to Satyaloka after he had attained heaven, to worship
<>Brahma1. Gan3ga1 too happened to be there. In the
<>devotional atmosphere at Satyaloka a casual breeze
<>removed Gan3ga1's clothes slightly from position, and
<>Maha1bhis2ak then cast a lustful glance at her which she
<>also returned. Brahma1, who was observing this exchange
<>of love got angry and cursed that Maha1bhi1s2ak be born
<>as a King on earth and Gan3ga1 as his wife. Gan3ga1
<>prayed for redemption from the curse, and Brahma1
<>told her that she would regain her old status after she
<>had delivered the As2t2avasus. As the consequence of
<>Brahma1's cure Maha1bhis2ak was born as King S4antanu
<>in the solar dynasty on earth and he married Gan3ga1.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapters 96 and 97).
<NI>4) {%Bhagi1ratha brought down Gan3ga1 on earth.%} King Sagara
<>of the solar dynasty had two wives called Sumati (Vai-
<>darbhi1) and Kes4ini1 (S4aibya1). A son called Asaman5jasa
<>was born to Kes4ini1, and 60,000 princes were born to
<>Sumati. Sagara drove out of the country Asamajn5asaa,
<>who turned out to be an enemy of the people. The
<>60,000 sons of Sagara also proved to be a menace to the
<>world, and the Devas approached Brahma1 for protection
<>from the menace. He assured the Devas that a sage
<>called Kapila will destroy the 60,000 evil fellows.
<NI>During the above period of time Sagara performed an
<>As4vamedha Yajn5a, and his sons went round the earth
<>with the sacrificial horse. But, when they reached the
<>sea-shore the horse disappeared. When the sons comp-
<>lained about it to their father, Sagara, he asked them
<>to look out for the horse in every part of the world and
<>bring it back. Not finding it anywhere on earth they
<>dug a hole and entered Pa1ta1la, where they saw Sage
<>Kapila absorbed in meditation and the missing horse
<>tied to a pole near the sage. (It was Indra who had
<>carried away the horse and tied it there). The sons of [Page277-b+ 64]
<>Sagara, believing that it was Kapila who had stolen
<>the horse were about to attack the sage when he opened
<>his eyes, and they were reduced to ashes in the fire of
<>Kapila's eyes.
<NI>His sons having not returned even after a long time
<>Sagara asked his grandson Am3s4uma1n to seek them out,
<>and after an extensive search he saw Kapila at Pa1ta1la.
<>Am3s4uma1n pleased Kapila with laudatory phrases and
<>the latter returned to him the sacrificial horse. Kapila
<>also pronounced the blessing that the grandson of Am3-
<>s4uma1n would perform the purificatory rites of Sagara's
<>sons by bringing down Gan3ga1 to earth from heaven.
<>Am3s4uma1n returned to the palace with the horse and
<>the as4vamedha was duly concluded.
<NI>From Am3s4uma1n was born Dili1pa and from him Bhagi1-
<>ratha. On becoming King, Bhagi1ratha handed over the
<>reins of government to his ministers and began efforts
<>to bring down Gan3ga1 to earth. He did tapas for thou-
<>sand years on the slopes of the Hima1layas when Gan3ga1
<>asked him to please S4iva first as he alone could face her
<>(Gan3ga1) fall on the earth. Accordingly he pleased S4iva
<>by his penance and S4iva agreed to receive Gan3ga1 on
<>his head. With a terrific noise Gan3ga1 came down on
<>S4iva's head. The haughty Gan3ga1 wanted to carry down
<>S4iva also to Pa1ta1la. Realising this ambition of her
<>S4iva blocked her passage with the result that she wan-
<>dered about in S4iva's matted hair for many years
<>without finding an outlet. Bhagi1ratha again did tapas
<>and pleased S4iva who shook his matted head and made
<>fall some water therefrom on earth. The water fell into
<>Bindusaras, and flowed in seven tributaries, the first
<>three, Hla1dini1, Pa1vani1 and Nalini1 towards the east, the
<>next three, Sucaks2us, Si1ta1 and Sindhu towards the west
<>and the seventh tributary followed Bhagi1ratha. In this
<>manner they progressed a great distance till they reach-
<>ed the a1s4rama of the sage Jahnu, and the haughty
<>Gan3ga1 flooded the a1s4rama. The sage got enraged at
<>this and drank up Gan3ga1. But Bhagi1ratha pleased the
<>sage who then let out Gan3ga1 through his ears. Thence-
<>forth Gan3ga1 came to be called Ja1hnavi1 also. Gan3ga1
<>again followed Bhagi1ratha to Pa1ta1la and made the sons
<>of Sagara attain salvation by purifying them with her
<>waters. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 43
<>and 44; Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 97; Devi1 Pura1n2a,
<>Dviti1ya Skandha; Dron2a Parva, Chapter 60; Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 4 and Vana Parva, Chapter 109).
<NI>5) {%Gan3ga1 flowed into the sea.%} After the purificatory rites
<>of the sons of Sagara were over, Bhagi1ratha conducted
<>Gan3ga1 to the sea and with its waters the sea became
<>full. (Vana Parva, Chapter 109, Verses 18-21).
<NI>6) {%Gan3ga1 set on the thighs of Prati1pa.%} Gan3ga1 once fell
<>in love with Prati1pa, father of S4antanu, and set on his
<>right thigh when he (Prati1pa) was doing penance on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for a son. Prati1pa did not agree
<>to Gan3ga1's proposal that he should marry her and told
<>her thus: “the right thigh is for the children and
<>daughters-in-law to sit on and the left thigh for the
<>wife; therefore, you be my son's wife.”
<NI>Then Prati1pa called his son S4antanu and told him:
<>“Sometime back a divine woman came to me and I
<>promised to wed her to you. Therefore, if any divine
<>woman approaches you for a son you must accept her,
<>and whatever she may do you must not object to
<>that...”. Not long after this Prati1pa crowned S4antanu [Page278-a+ 65]
<>King and left for the forest, (A1di Parva, Chapter 97).
<NI>7) {%As2t2avasus and Gan3ga1.%} While the wife of Dyau, one
<>of the As2t2avasus (eight Vasus) was roaming about in
<>the forest she saw Nandini1 (the divine cow) grazing
<>with her calf near the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha, and she
<>desired to have the cow to be presented to her intimate
<>friend Jitavati1, the daughter of King Us4i1nara. She
<>informed her husband, Dyau about this desire of hers,
<>and Dyau told his relations about it. Next day the
<>As2t2avasus, in the absence of Vasis2t2ha at the a1s4rama,
<>stole off Nandini1 and her calf. When Vasis2t2ha returned
<>to the a1s4rama the cow and calf were missing, and he
<>divined the reason for it with his divine eyes. He cursed
<>that the As2t2avasus be born as men on earth, and when
<>they prayed for redemption from the curse Vasis2t2ha
<>told them that they would be born as men within one
<>year from that day, die at once and return to heaven
<>At the same time the sage said that Dyau alone, who
<>took the leading part in stealing the cow, would live on
<>earth for a longer period before he returned to heaven.
<>(The reputed Bhi1s2ma was this Dyau). The As2t2avasus
<>set out for the earth to be born as men and on their
<>way they met Gan3ga1 and told her about their curse
<>etc. Gan3ga1 also told them about her curse, and permitt-
<>ed them to be born in her womb. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>99).
<NI>8) {%Gan3ga1 became the wife of S4antanu and the As2t2avasus were
<>born.%} Once while hunting on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>S4antanu saw a beautiful maiden and they fell in love
<>with each other. She agreed to become his wife on the
<>condition that he would not oppose whatever she said.
<>S4antanu agreed to it and married her. Soon after a
<>child was born to them and in the very presence of
<>S4antanu, she threw the child into the Gan3ga1. As per
<>previous condition S4antanu kept mum at this. She
<>threw into the river the seven As2t2avasus, who were
<>born to her in succession. When she was about to
<>throw the last eighth of the As2t2avasus (Dyau) into
<>the river S4antanu prevented her. She got angry at
<>this and disappeared with the child. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 98).
<NI>9) {%S4antanu got back the son.%} Thirtytwo years after,
<>S4antanu went hunting again on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>where he saw the river obstructed in its course with
<>arrows by a handsome boy. S4antanu did not recognise
<>that the boy was his son, who had been named Deva-
<>vrata by Gan3ga1. Devavrata disappeared after throwing
<>S4antanu into an illusion by his magic power. All of a
<>sudden a doubt dawned in his mind whether the boy
<>was his own son, and he called out to Gan3ga1 to show
<>him the boy. Gan3ga1 appeared with her son with beau-
<>tiful ornaments on him and spoke to S4antanu thus:
<>“This is Devavrata, the eighth son whom you entrusted
<>to me. He has mastered everything in archery from
<>Vasis2t2ha, and he is Dyau (the vasu) son of An3gi-
<>ras reborn. You may please take charge of him.” After
<>saying this she returned to heaven. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 100).

<>n2ya).
<NI>11) {%Gan3ga1 and Bhi1s2ma. (See under Bhi1s2ma).%}
<NI>12) {%Greatness (divine nature) of Gan3ga1.%} Maha1bha1rata has
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 26), the following on the
<>greatness of Gan2ga1.--
<NI>If, after death, the bones of the dead are deposited [Page278-b+ 64]
<>in Gan3ga1 the departed will attain heaven. Even if one
<>had sinned throughout his life he would attain Vis2n2u-
<>pa1da (heaven) if he worshipped Gan3ga1. Bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1 is as beneficial as performing hundred yajn5as.
<>As long as the bones of one remain in the waters of the
<>Gan3ga1 so long will he occupy an honourable seat in
<>heaven. He who has come in contact with its water will
<>shine forth as the sun devoid of all darkness. Places
<>which are not favoured by its waters will become barren
<>like night without the moon and trees without flowers.
<>Gan3ga1 water is more than enough to satisfy living
<>things in all the three worlds. He who does penance
<>standing on one leg for thousand years, and he who
<>gives up his body in the waters of the Gan3ga1 are on
<>a par with each other. God attaches more importance
<>to him who has fallen into the Gan3ga1 than to him, who
<>has performed tapas hanging by his head for a thousand
<>years. He who smears the sand on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>on his body will get the lustre and glow of the devas,
<>and he, who smears the sand on his head will shine
<>forth like the Sun. All the sins of those on whom has
<>blown the air which had come in contact with Gan3ga1
<>water will be swept away. It should be known that
<>Gan3ga1 water can wash off all sins and purify mortals.
<>The Agni Pura1n2a (Chapter 110) has the following on
<>this subject.
<NI>Through whatever places the Gan3ga1 flows those places
<>become sublime and sacred. Gan3ga1 is the refuge of all
<>created beings who aspire for the final good. If Gan3ga1
<>is worshipped daily it will save families both on the
<>mother's and the father's side from evil fate. To drink
<>Gan3ga1 water is better than the observance of a thou-
<>sand lunar months. If one worships Gan3ga1 for a month
<>one will derive all the benefits of having performed all
<>the yajn5as. Even the blind (the ignorant) who worship
<>Gan3ga1, will attain equal status with the devas. The
<>sight of Gan3ga1, contact with its waters and drinking
<>Gan3ga1 water will purify people in thousands and lakhs.
<NI>13) {%Gan3ga1 and Ra1dha1.%} Gan3ga1 is Ra1dha1 and Kr2s2n2a li-
<>quidified into water. Once in goloka Ra1dha1devi1 attempt-
<>ed to drink Gan3ga1 dry, who, terror-stricken, hid
<>herself at the feet of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, and the whole

<HI>GARBHA(M). The Pura1n2as have described the views
<>of sages about the origin of a1tman in woman's womb.
<>Asitamaha1muni stated the following about the birth of [Page279-b+ 63]
<>a child to King Janaka. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Chapter
<NI>48). Of the seven elements in the human body, viz.,
<>Rasa, Rakta (blood), Ma1m3sa (flesh), Medas (fost),
<>Asthi (bone), Majja1 (marrow) and S4ukla (seminal
<>fluid) the last one, S4ukla, is the most valuable. Brahma-
<>bi1ja (the seed for production) is contained in S4ukla.
<>From the food we consume, blood and the seminal fluid
<>take their nutrition. The S4ukla emitted during coitus
<>enters the womb of the woman propelled as it were by
<>Kros2t2ava1yu. It takes only one night for the S4ukla to
<>get inextricably mixed with blood in the womb. In that
<>mixing if the proportion of blood is higher, the child
<>born will be girl, and if the proportion of S4ukla is high-
<>er, the offspring will be boy. If blood and S4ukla are
<>mixed exactly in equal proportions the child will be
<>‘neutral’, neither girl nor boy. During the first month
<>of pregnancy the child will be in liquid form. In the
<>second, it solidifies due to the mixing and interplay of
<>heat, cold, air, etc. During the third, holes for
<>eye, ear, etc. become ready and the vein system is
<>formed. In the fourth, head, hands and legs of the
<>child are formed, and it is during this period that the
<>prospective mother develops certain desires. If those
<>desires are not satisfied the child may be born with
<>physical deformities. During the fifth month the hips
<>and bones develop. The various organs get firmer and
<>stronger gradually and fingers appear during the sixth
<>month. It is during the sixth month that hairs on the
<>head and body appear and feelings and emotions ori-
<>ginate in the mind. During the seventh month the ten
<>va1yus (winds) on the basis of the nervous system are
<>released, and the child experiences glimpses of its pre-
<>vious existence, and ability to feel pain also is there.
<>During the ninth month due to the force of the wind
<>which effects actual delivery the child gets head down
<>in the womb, and during the tenth month it emerges
<>out of the womb. The child loses its memory about the
<>past because of its contact with the female organ
<>and external wind.
<NI>According to the Agni Pura1n2a the process is a little
<>different:
<NI>When Ji1va (the soul) has entered the womb for rebirth
<>it remains in fluid form during the first month. During
<>the second month it solidifies; in the third month the
<>organs begin to develop, in the fourth month skin,
<>flesh and bones appear, in the fifth month hairs appear,
<>in the sixth month mind is produced, in the seventh
<>month the child will begin to feel pain. The body is
<>covered by a skin (Garbhacarma) and both hands are
<>held above the head in saluting position. If the child
<>is a female it lies in the left side of the mother's womb,
<>if a male on the right and if ‘neutral’ in the middle of
<>it. From the seventh month the child begins to experi-
<>ence the taste of foods consumed by the mother. During
<>the eighth and ninth month there would be great
<>emotional excitements and upsurges. If the mother
<>suffered from chronic diseases the child also would in-
<>herit it. When pregnancy is matured thus, certain
<>winds lead the child down the womb and it gets out
<>through the female organ.

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Br2haspati once approached, on the crest of
<>a wave of lust, Mamata1, his brother's wife who was
<>pregnant then. The child from the mother's womb said
<>‘no’ to the move. But, Br2haspati cursed the child and
<>had his own way with Mamata1. Thus two children
<>developed in her womb. Just after delivering the child-
<>ren the mother went away leaving the child by Br2has-
<>pati behind. The Devas took charge of the forsaken
<>child and named him Bharadva1ja. Ultimately they
<>handed over the child (Bharadva1ja) to king Bharata,
<>the famous son of Dus2yanta. Children had already been
<>born to Bharata by his three wives, but as all of them
<>were found to be immoral the mothers themselves killed
<>them. It was at such a juncture that Bharata got Bha-
<>radva1ja as adopted son. (Bharadva1ja is known by
<>another name also, Vitatha). From Vitatha was born
<>Manyu, from Manyu Br2hatks2etra from Br2hatks2etra
<>Jaya and from Jaya Garga. The famous Rantideva
<>was the grandson of Nara. (the brother of Garga) and
<>son of Sam3kr2ti. A son called S4ani was born to Garga
<>after which he took to Sannya1sa. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama
<>Skandha, Chapters 20 and 21).
<NI>3) {%Ya1davaguru.%} In course of time Garga became precep-
<>tor of the Ya1davas. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma who
<>had returned to Mathura1 from Amba1di were sent to
<>sage Sandi1pani in obedience to the advice of Garga.
<>(Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>4) {%Garga and Mucukunda.%} Garga once visited Mucukunda,
<>son of Ma1ndha1ta1 at his palace, and very much pleased
<>with the devoted reception accorded to him blessed
<>Mucukunda that one day he would see S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in

<NI>2) {%How he became prosperous.%} Sage Ga1rgya had many
<>children. It was while he was staying in the forest with
<>his wife and children that S4ri1 Ra1ma came to that forest
<>for Vanava1sa. The news of the exile of S4ri1 Ra1ma spread
<>like wild-fire and many brahmins flocked to the place
<>and S4ri1 Ra1ma gave them immense riches. Wife of Ga1r-
<>gya heard the news only late and as soon as she heard
<>the same she called her husband from the fields where
<>he was working and taking away from him the imple-
<>ments sent him post-haste to the place of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Trijat2a as soon as he came to the presence of Ra1ma told
<>him the purpose of his visit. Huge herds of cows were
<>then grazing on the banks of the Yamuna1 river. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma told Ga1rgya to take a stump and throw it with
<>all his strength. He did so and S4ri1 Ra1ma gave him all
<>the cows grazing up to the place where the stump fell.
<>It was a big lot and Ga1rgya became prosperous from
<>that day onwards. (Sarga 32, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Brahma1
<>-Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Garud2a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci married the eight daughters of Daks2a called
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1. And to Ta1mra1 five daughters were born,
<>viz. Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. Out
<>of the five women Kraun5ci1 became mother of the owls,
<>Bha1si1 delivered the bha1sas (types of birds) and from
<>S4yeni1 were born vultures and kites. Ham3sa, Kalaham3sa,
<>Koka etc. are children of Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1. From S4uki1 was
<>born Nala1 and from Nala1, Vinata1; Arun2a and Garud2a
<>were the two sons born to Vinata1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 15).
<NI>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata about the birth of
<>Arun2a and Garud2a. Kas4yapa who was much pleased
<>with the service of Vinata1 and Kadru1 asked them to
<>select any boon they desired. Kadru1 chose to have a
<>thousand na1gas as her children while Vinata1 chose to
<>have two sons more powerful and heroic than the thou-
<>sand sons of Kadru1. After granting them the boon
<>Kas4yapa retreated into the forest.
<NI>After some time Kadru1 laid thousand eggs and Vinata1
<>two eggs. Both of them kept their eggs in hot pots. In
<>the 500th year the eggs of Kadru1 hatched and thousand
<>serpents of various kinds emerged out of them. But
<>Vinata1's eggs did not hatch yet, and the sight of Kadru1
<>playing with her children pained Vinata1 much. She,
<>therefore, broke open one of her eggs in secret, and a
<>half-grown child stepped out of it. That child was
<>Arun2a. Arun2a got angry that Vinata1 forced open the
<>egg prematurely. He told her that as punishment there-
<>of she would become a slave of Kadru1. But, Arun2a
<>granted her redemption from the curse thus: After an-
<>other 500 years the remaining egg of yours will hatch
<>and a son endowed with exceptional power and pro-
<>wess will be born to you. He will liberate you from
<>slavery.” After telling his mother so much Arun2a rose
<>to the sky where he became the charioteer of the Sun.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 16. See also Para 6 infra).
<NI>After 500 years the egg broke itself open and out came
<>Garud2a with blazing effulgence, and he rose up in the
<>sky. His body glowed like the sun. The Devas who got
<>themselves dimmed by his effulgence asked Agnideva
<>the reason therefor. Agnideva told them about the
<>birth of Garud2a and also that he was equally effulgent
<>as himself (Agnideva). Then all of them went to
<>Garud2a and lavished on his head all possible blessings,
<>and Garud2a, as requested by them, controlled his efful-
<>gence and returned to his mother. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 23).
<NI>3) {%Slavery of Vinata1:%} The churning of the Milk-ocean
<>was done before Garud2a was born. Indra got a horse
<>named Uccaih2s4ravas from the Ocean of Milk. Between
<>Kadru1 and Vinata1 a dispute arose as regards the colour
<>of the horse's tail, Kadru1 saying that it was black while
<>Vinata1 asserted that it was white. They further agreed
<>to test the colour the next day, betting that she who
<>was proved to be wrong would become the slave of the
<>victor. As the na1ga sons of Kadru1 hung on to the tail [Page281-b+ 64]
<>of the horse the tail appeared to be black and Vinata1
<>lost the bet and became Kadru1's slave.
<NI>It was at this juncture that Garud2a was born, and he
<>felt highly mortified to find his mother working as a
<>slave of Kadru1.
<NI>Kadru1 and her na1ga sons once ordered Vinata1 to carry
<>them to the na1ga residence in the middle of the ocean,
<>called Ra1man2i1yaka (Raman2am). Accordingly Vinata1
<>carrying Kadru1 on her shoulders and Garud2a carrying
<>Kadru1's sons on his shoulders rose up in the sky. But,
<>Garud2a did not relish the slavish work, and he, carry-
<>ing with him the na1gas, flew up to the sun's orbit. The
<>na1ga children fainted due to the excessive heat. But, on
<>the request of Kadru1 Indra sent heavy rain and the
<>na1gas regained consciousness. By then they had reached
<>Ra1man2i1yaka island.
<NI>4) {%Attempt at freeing Vinata1 from thraldom.%} Garud2a, ex-
<>tremely pained at the pitiable plight of his mother, one
<>day asked Kadru1 what price she and her children
<>demanded for freeing Vinata1 from slavery, and Kadru1
<>demanded Amr2ta from Devaloka as the price.
<>Garud2a decided to get it and informed his mother
<>about his decision to fly to Devaloka. But, what about
<>food till he reached Devaloka? Vinata1 solved the pro-
<>blem by advising Garud2a to eat the nis2a1das he will
<>meet on his way to Devaloka at the island called
<>Nis2a1da1laya, at the same time specially forbidding him
<>from eating on any account, brahmins who might be
<>there, at Nis2a1da1laya. How to distinguish brahmins
<>from others, queried Garud2a, and his mother replied
<>by pointing out that the brahmin will burn the throat
<>of him who tries to eat him, like fire. Then Vinata1
<>blessed her son that his wings would be protected by
<>Va1yu, the lower half of his body by sun and moon, the
<>rest of the body by the Vasus and the head by Agni.
<>She also promised to wait there till her son returned.
<NI>5) {%Garud2a to Devaloka.%} After saluting his mother
<>Garud2a set out on his quest for Amr2ta. All the fourteen
<>worlds shook at the lashing of his wings. He reached
<>Nis2a1da1laya, where while consuming whole lots of Nis2a1-
<>das a brahmin and his wife also happened to get into
<>his throat. Garud2a felt their presence immediately in
<>his throat and requested them to get out of his mouth.
<>Accordingly they got out and also blessed Garud2a, who
<>continued on his journey.
<NI>Next Garud2a reached the forest where his father
<>Kas4yapa was engaged in tapas. He told him about his
<>mission and requested him for something to eat.
<>Kas4yapa replied thus:--“You see a pool wherein an
<>elephant and a tortoise are living for long as enemies.
<>Long ago two brothers Vibha1vasu and Suprati1ka quar-
<>relled over their paternal wealth and at the height of
<>it Vibha1vasu cursed Suprati1ka to become an elephant
<>when Suprati1ka pronounced the counter curse that
<>Vibha1vasu should turn out to be a tortoise. You, my
<>son Garud2a may eat that elephant and tortoise. May
<>your journey for Amr2ta be crowned with success.
<NI>Now, Garud2a after saluting his father, flew up in the
<>sky carrying in his beak the elephant and the tortoise
<>from the pool. As trees were falling uprooted due to
<>the terrific vibrations caused by the lashing of his wings
<>Garud2a did not find a convenient place to sit down to
<>eat his food. While continuing the journey Garud2a saw
<>a big tree, its branches spread out in a circumference [Page282-a+ 65]
<>of a hundred yojanas. But, as soon as Garud2a set foot on
<>a branch of the tree it (branch) crumbled down. On
<>that broken branch were the sages called Ba1lakhilyas
<>doing tapas hanging their heads down. Fearing that the
<>sages might fall down Garud2a continued his flight
<>holding in his beak the torn branch of the tree. But he
<>could not find a safe place to deposit the branch with
<>the sages. So he came again to Mount Gandhama1dana
<>and saw Kas4yapa, who apologised to the Ba1lakhilyas
<>on behalf of his son and also explained to them about
<>his mission. The Ba1lakhilyas were pleased and they left
<>the place for the Hima1layas. As advised by Kas4yapa
<>Garud2a deposited the branch of the tree on an unin-
<>habited mountain peak. Garud2a ate the elephant and
<>the tortoise there, and therefrom flew to Devaloka (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 29, 30).
<NI>6) {%Ba1lakhilyas cursed Indra.%} Even before the arrival of
<>Garud2a ill omens began appearing in Devaloka. Indra
<>asked Br2haspati for explanation about the ill omens.
<>Br2haspati with his divine eyes saw Garud2a approach-
<>ing Devaloka for Amr2ta, and he told Indra about
<>Garud2a born out of the powers of the tapas of Kas4yapa
<>and the Ba1lakhilyas. He also told that such a fate as
<>the present one befell Indra due to a curse of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas. Indra and the other Devas stood guard
<>over the pot of Amr2ta ready to repel all possible
<>attacks.
<NI>There was a reason for Garud2a's birth from the powers
<>of the tapas of the Ba1lakhilyas, and also for Indra to
<>be put into the present predicament due to the curse
<>of the Ba1lakhilyas. Kas4yapapraja1pati, a long time ago,
<>began a terrific yajn5a for a son, and Indra and the
<>Ba1lakhilyas who numbered more than 60,000 were
<>deputed by Kas4yapa to collect firewood for the yajn5a.
<>The Ba1lakhilyas were only of the size of a thumb, and
<>Indra who very easily collected all the firewood needed
<>for the yajn5a laughed at the tiny Ba1lakhilyas who were
<>carrying small twigs etc. for firewood. Angered at the
<>insult the Ba1lakhilyas removed themselves to another
<>place nearby and began a yajn5a directed against Indra
<>who alarmed at it sought the help of Kas4yapa who then
<>held peace talks with the Ba1lakhilyas. They transferred
<>their ya1gas4akti (ya1jn5ic powers) also to Kas4yapa and
<>agreed to be satisfied with the condition that as the
<>result of Kas4yapa's yajn5a a son should be born to him,
<>who (the son) would defeat Indra. Thus, for the time
<>being Indra escaped from the wrath of the Ba1lakhilyas.
<>After the yajn5a was over Vinata1 came to Kas4yapa and
<>he blessed her with a son wishing that he should be-
<>come exceptionally strong and powerful, and that was
<>Garud2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>7) {%Amr2takalas4a1paharan2am. (The pot of nectar carried
<>away).%} Garud2a approached the pot of nectar, and
<>Vis4vakarma1 who attacked him first was felled to the
<>ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of
<>Garud2a's wings blinded everybody. The Devas and
<>Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up
<>against Garud2a, but he defeated them all, and entered
<>the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept.
<>Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and
<>they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to
<>lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels.
<>Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with
<>glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of
<>fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very [Page282-b+ 65]
<>look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to
<>death. Garud2a blinded those eyes by raising a torrent
<>of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and
<>and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny
<>shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the
<>wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar
<>in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the
<>sun by his outspread wings. Maha1vis2n2u, who became so
<>much pleased with the tremendous achievements of
<>Garud2a asked him to choose any boon. Garud2a
<>requested Vis2n2u that he should be made his (Vis2n2u's)
<>vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting
<>amr2ta. Both the boons were granted.
<NI>8) {%Garud2a and Indra became friends.%} Indra hit with the
<>Vajra (his special weapon) the wings of Garud2a who
<>was returning from Vis2n2u. It did not wound his body,
<>but a feather of his fell in the atmosphere. Everybody
<>who saw the feather acclaimed Garud2a as Suparn2a (he
<>with the good wings). Indra was wonder-struck, and
<>he approached Garud2a and requested that they should
<>be friends in future and the pot of nectar be returned.
<>Garud2a replied that the nectar would be returned if
<>he was granted the power to make na1gas his food, and
<>Indra blessed him that he would live by consuming
<>na1gas. And then Garud2a told Indra thus: “I took this
<>pot of amr2ta not for my own use. The na1gas cheated
<>my mother and made her a slave, and she will be freed
<>if only this pot of nectar is given to them (na1gas). You
<>may snatch off the pot from the na1gas; I shall not
<>object to it.”
<NI>Indra and Garud2a thus became friends and the former
<>followed Garud2a on his way back home.
<NI>9) {%Garud2a handed over the pot of amr2ta to the na1gas and
<>Indra cheated them of it.%} Garud2a handed over the pot of
<>nectar to the na1gas, who on the suggestion of the
<>former placed the pot on darbha grass spread on the
<>ground. Also, in accordance with Garud2a's advice that
<>they should take a purificatory bath before tasting the
<>amr2ta the na1gas went out to have the bath, and in
<>their absence Indra carried off the pot of nectar back
<>to Devaloka. Failing to find the pot of nectar on their
<>return from bath the aggrieved na1gas licked the darbha
<>on which the pot was placed with the result that their
<>tongues were cloven into two. It was from that day
<>onwards that the na1gas became double-tongued
<>(dvijihvas). And, thus Garud2a redeemed his mother
<>from slavery. (A1di Parva, Chapter 34).
<NI>10) {%The fig tree which Garud2a broke with his beaks and
<>Lan3ka1.%} It has been noted above that Garud2a on his
<>way to Devaloka rested on a fig tree. That fig is
<>called Subhadra in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>Ra1van2a saw the fig tree around which sages were sitting
<>and which bore marks made by Garud2a sitting thereon.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 35, Verse
<>26).
<NI>There is some connection between this tree and Lan3ka1.
<>Garud2a had, as directed by Kas4yapa, deposited in the
<>sea the branch of the tree on which the Ba1lakhilyas
<>hung in tapas and with which Garud2a flew hither and
<>thither fearing about the safety of the Ba1lakhilyas. At
<>the spot in the sea where the branch was deposited
<>sprang up an island like the peak of a mountain. It
<>was this island which in after years became reputed as
<>Lan3ka1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 4). [Page283-a+ 65]
<NI>11) {%Garud2a, Saubhari and Ka1liya.%} Garud2a had always
<>entertained great hatred against the na1gas, and now
<>Indra's permission having been obtained by him to eat
<>the na1gas for food, Garud2a decided to launch a regular
<>na1ga-hunting expedition. He began eating the na1gas
<>one by one. Alarmed at this the na1gas planned for their
<>security in a conclave, and approached Garud2a with
<>the proposal that one na1ga would go to him daily
<>to serve as his food instead of his indiscriminate killing
<>of them. Garud2a accepted their proposal. After some
<>time the na1gas proposed to Garud2a that they would
<>conduct a sarpa-bali (sacrifice of serpents) and submit
<>the food got out of the bali to him so that his na1ga-
<>hunting might be stopped for ever. Garud2a agreed to
<>this also. According to the new agreement daily one
<>na1ga began going to Garud2a with the food got
<>out of the bali.
<NI>But Ka1liya alone did not agree to the programme as he
<>did not recognise Garud2a to be superior to him in
<>power. And, Garud2a, who wanted to teach the haughty
<>Ka1liya a lesson challenged him to fight, and the fight
<>took place in river Ka1lindi1, Ka1liya's abode. During
<>the fight the lashing of Garud2a's wings raised the
<>water in Ka1lindi1 up in the sky and it drenched the
<>sage Saubhari all over, who was performing tapas on
<>the banks of Ka1lindi1. Saubhari cursed that the body
<>of Garud2a be shattered into a thousand pieces if ever
<>he entered that area in future, and thenceforth the
<>place became a prohibited area for Garud2a. During
<>after years Ka1liya was put up at this place.
<NI>A kadamba tree alone outlived the eflect of the poison
<>of Ka1liya. The tree could outlive the deadly poison
<>because Garud2a had rested on it on his way back from
<>Devaloka with amr2ta. (Bha1gavata das4ama S4kandha).
<NI>12) {%Relationship of Garud2a with the kings of the solar
<>dynasty.%} King Sagara of the solar dynasty was married
<>to Sumati, the elder sister of Garud2a, and there is a
<>story behind the marriage.
<NI>There was once a king called Suba1hu in the solar
<>dynasty. He married one Ya1davi1, but for many years
<>they had no issues. Ya1davi1 had become old by the
<>time she conceived a child as the result of many
<>yajn5as etc. But, Suba1hu's other wives, viz. co-wives
<>of Ya1davi1, did not like the prospects of Ya1davi1
<>becoming a mother. They administered poison to her
<>with the result that Ya1davi1 did not deliver in time,
<>but continued as a pregnant woman for seven years.
<>The sad couple, for their mental relief went into the
<>forest and lived as disciples of a sage called Aurva. But
<>Suba1hu died rather soon and Ya1davi1 prepared
<>herself to follow him in the funeral pyre. But, the
<>sage Aurva prevented her from self immolation speak-
<>ing to her thus: “You shall not act rashly. The child
<>in your womb will become a famous emperor and rule
<>over the whole world.”
<NI>Ya1davi1 yielded to the sage's advice and did not court
<>death, and soon afterwards she delivered a son, and he
<>was named Sagara, which meant “he who was affected
<>by poison even while he was in the mother's womb. It
<>was this child who, in later years, became reputed as
<>emperor Sagara.
<NI>Sagara married the elder sister of Garud2a when he was
<>living as a boy in Aurva's a1s4rama, and there is a story
<>behind the marriage, a story which related to the time
<>when Garud2a was not born. [Page283-b+ 65]
<NI>Vinata1, mother of Garud2a, while she was working as the
<>slave of Kadru1, one day went into the woods to collect
<>firewood for her mistress. In the terrible rain and
<>storm that ensued, Vinata1 lost her track and wandered
<>in the forest for many days before she could take shelter
<>in the a1s4rama of a Sannya1sin. The pious man felt sorry
<>for poor Vinata1 and blessed her that a son, who would
<>be able to win freedom for her would be born to her.
<>Garud2a was the son thus born to her.
<NI>Before the birth of Garud2a when Kas4yapa and Vinata1
<>were living together with their daughter Sumati the boy
<>sage Upamanyu, son of Sutapas, went to them and told
<>Kas4yapa thus: “While touring round the earth I wor-
<>shipped the pitr2s at Gaya1 and I have been told that they
<>(Pitr2s) would get redemption only in case I married and
<>became a father. I, therefore, request you to please give
<>your daughter Sumati to me as wife. Vinata1 did not
<>relish this proposal. Upamanyu got angry at the re-
<>jection of his offer and cursed Vinata1 saying that if
<>Sumati was given in marriage to any other brahmin boy
<>she (Vinata1) would die with her head broken into
<>pieces.
<NI>It was during this period when Vinata1 was in a fix
<>about the marriage of Sumati that Garud2a was born to
<>her. He also thought over the problem and argued like
<>this: the curse is only against a brahmin boy marrying
<>my sister Sumati; why not Sumati be given in marriage
<>to a Ks2atriya; but where to find an eligible Ks2atriya
<>boy? At this stage Vinata1 asked him to go and meet the
<>Sannya1sin, who had promised her an illustrious son, in
<>the forest and this Sannya1sin directed Garud2a to Aurva,
<>for advice and guidance. When Garud2a met Aurva and
<>sought his advice about the marriage of his sister, the
<>sage thought that the context offered a very good bride
<>to Sagara. And, according to Aurva's advice Sumati
<>was married to Sagara, and thus Garud2a became re-
<>lated to the Kings of the Solar dynasty. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The Sixty thousand
<>sons born to Sagara by Sumati were reduced to ashes in
<>the fire which emanated from the eyes of Kapila. (See
<>Kapila). When Am3s4uma1n, the grandson of Sagara was
<>going around the world to find out these 60,000 sons he
<>met Garud2a on the way, and it was he who advised that
<>the waters of Gan3ga1 should be brought down on earth
<>so that the dead sons of Sagara might get spiritual
<>redemption. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 41).
<NI>13) {%Garud2a's conceit laid low.%} A very beautiful daughter,
<>Gun2akes4i1, was born to Ma1tali, the charioteer of Indra.
<>In the course of his search for a suitable husband for
<>Gun2akes4i1 he came to Pa1ta1laloka in the company of
<>Na1rada, and there Ma1tali selected a noble na1ga called
<>Sumukha as his prospective son-in-law. But a month
<>before Garud2a had eaten Sumukha's father Cikara, and
<>he had also given notice to Sumukha that within a
<>month's time he too would be eaten.
<NI>Na1rada and Ma1tali met Sumukha at the abode of his
<>grandfather A1ryaka, who was very glad to marry his
<>grandson to Ma1tali's daughter. But, the threat of
<>Garud2a that he would eat Sumukha before the month
<>was over stared them all cruelly in their face. So, they
<>appealed to Indra for a solution to the problem, in the
<>presence of Maha1vis2n2u. Indra gave an extension of life
<>to Sumukha and he wedded Gun2akes4i1. The marriage
<>enraged Garud2a so much that he went to Indra's [Page284-a+ 64]
<>assembly and insulted both Indra and Vis2n2u at which
<>Vis2n2u extended his right hand to Garud2a asking him
<>whether he could hold the hand. And, when Garud2a
<>placed Vis2n2u's hand on his head he felt as if the whole
<>weight of the three worlds was put on the head. Garud2a
<>admitted his defeat. Maha1vis2n2u thus laid low the
<>conceit of Garud2a. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<NI>14) {%Garud2a helped Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava was a disciple of
<>Vis4va1mitra. Once Dharmadeva, to test Vis4va1mitra, went
<>to his a1s4rama disguised as Vasis2t2ha and asked for food.
<>As there was no ready-made food at the a1s4rama just
<>then, Vis4va1mitra naturally took some time to cook new
<>food, and he went with it, steaming hot, in a plate to
<>the guest. Saying that he would return within minutes
<>and receive the food, the guest (Dharmadeva) left the
<>place, and Vis4va1mitra stood there with the plate in
<>hand awaiting the return of the guest. He had to
<>remain standing thus for one hundred years, and during
<>this whole period it was Ga1lava who stood there looking
<>after his guru. When hundred years were completed
<>Dharmadeva returned to Vis4va1mitra and accepted his
<>hospitality, and then only could the latter take some
<>rest.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra blessed Ga1lava, and now it was time for him
<>to leave the a1s4rama. Though Vis4va1mitra told that no
<>gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee) was required Ga1lava persist-
<>ed in asking him what fee or present he wanted.
<>Vis4va1mitra lost his temper and told Ga1lava that if he
<>was so very particular about gurudaks2in2a1, eight hun-
<>dred horses all having the colour of moon, and one ear
<>black in colour might be given as daks2in2a1. Ga1lava
<>stood there aghast at the above pronouncement of his
<>preceptor, when Garud2a happened to go over there and
<>hear from Ga1lava about his sad plight. Money was re-
<>quired to purchase horses, but Ga1lava was penniless.
<>At any rate Garud2a with Ga1lava on his back flew east-
<>wards and reached R2s2abhaparvata and they rested on
<>a peak of it. There the Brahma1 woman, S4a1n2d2ili1 was
<>engaged in tapas and she served them with food. After
<>food Garud2a spoke disparagingly about S4a1n2d2ili1. Garud2a
<>and Ga1lava slept that night on the floor, but when they
<>woke up in the morning lo! Garud2a was completely
<>shed of his feathers. Garud2a stood before S4a1n2d2ili1, his
<>head bent in anguish. S4a1n2d2ili1 blessed Garud2a, who
<>then got back his old feathers.
<NI>Continuing their journey Garud2a and Ga1lava reached
<>the palace of the very rich King, Yaya1ti. Garud2a intro-
<>duced Ga1lava to Yaya1ti, who found it difficult to get
<>800 horses for Ga1lava. But, Yaya1ti gave his daughter
<>Ma1dhavi1 to Ga1lava saying that he might give her to
<>any King and get money enough to purchase 800
<>horses. After thus showing the means to get money to
<>Ga1lava, Garud2a returned home.
<NI>Ga1lava gave Ma1dhavi1 first to King Haryas4va of
<>Ayodhya1, then to King Divoda1sa of Ka1s4i1 and next to
<>King Us4i1nara of Bhoja and got from them two hundred
<>horses each, and he submitted the horses and also
<>Ma1dhavi1 in lieu of the balance of two hundred horses
<>to Vis4va1mitra as daks2in2a1. A son called As2t2aka was born
<>to Vis4va1mitra by Ma1dhavi1, who had been granted a
<>boon that she would not lose her youth and beauty even
<>though she lived with any number of people. (Udyoga-
<>Parva Chapter 108).

<>went to Devaloka and plucked the Pa1rija1ta flower from

<>Indra and Kr2s2n2a in which Garud2a also joined. Garud2a
<>directed his main attention on Aira1vata which, at his
<>blows, fainted and fell down. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter 73).
<NI>16) {%Defeated by Va1suki.%} To churn the Milk-Ocean the
<>Devas and Asuras decided to use Mount Mandara as
<>the shaft and Va1suki as the rope to rotate the shaft.
<>The attempts of the Devas, the Asuras and the Bhu1taga-
<>n2as of S4iva failed to uproot and bring with them the
<>mountain, when Garud2a, at the instance of Vis2n2u
<>brought the mountain as easily as a kite carries a frog.
<>Again, when others failed to bring Va1suki from na1ga-
<>loka Garud2a went and asked the na1ga chief to follow
<>him to the ocean of Milk. Va1suki replied that if his
<>presence was so indispensable he must be carried over
<>there. Then Garud2a caught the middle part of Va1suki
<>in his beak and rose in the air. But, even though
<>Garud2a rose beyond the horizon, when he looked down
<>half of Va1suki still remained on the ground. Garud2a
<>then tried to fold Va1suki into two and carry it, but,
<>again to no purpose. Disappointed and humiliated
<>Garud2a returned without Va1suki. Afterwards Va1suki
<>was brought to the ocean of Milk by S4iva's hand stret-
<>ched down into Pa1ta1la. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>17) {%Bhi1ma went in search of the Saugandhika flower on

<>the forest, the Pa1n2d2avas were put up at the a1s4rama of
<>mahars2i A1rs2t2is2en2a, Garud2a picked up from the depths
<>of the sea one day a na1ga called R2ddhima1n, and due to
<>the vibration caused by the lashing of Garud2a's wings
<>Kalha1ra flowers from the garden of Kubera were flown
<>to the feet of Pa1n5ca1li1. She wore the fragrant flowers in
<>her hair saying that if she were to have good flowers,
<>wind had to bring them. Since there was a mild and
<>veiled insinuation in that statement that Bhi1ma was
<>inferior to the wind the former did not appreciate that
<>comment by Pa1n5ca1li1. And so he rushed to Mount
<>Gandhama1dana to collect Kalha1ra flowers. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 106).
<NI>18) {%Garud2a saved Uparicaravasu.%} Once a controversy
<>started between the Devas and the brahmins, the former
<>advocating the use of goat's flesh in performing yajn5as
<>while the brahmins contended that grains were sufficient
<>for the purpose. Uparicaravasu, who arbitrated in the
<>debate spoke in favour of the Devas, which the brahmins
<>did not like, and they cursed Vasu to fall from the sky
<>into the pits of the earth. This curse was countered
<>by the Devas blessing him that as long as Uparicara-
<>vasu remained on earth he would not feel hungry and
<>that he would regain his old form due to the blessings
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Vasu prayed to Vis2n2u, who sent Garud2a
<>to the former, and Garud2a carried Vasu to the sky on
<>his wings. Thus Vasu became again Uparicaravasu.

<NI>2) {%Sons of Gautama.%} The eldest son of Gautama was
<>S4ata1nanda. (S4loka 2, Sarga, 51, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a). Gautama had two sons. S4aradva1n and
<>Ciraka1ri1. S4aradva1n was born with arrows in his hand.
<>(S4loka 2, Chapter 130, A1di Parva). Ciraka1ri1 used to
<>ponder over everything before he acted and so all his
<>actions were delayed. He got his name Ciraka1ri1.
<>(Chapter 266, Sabha1 Parva). S4aradva1n was known as
<>Gautama also. That was why Kr2pa and Kr2pi1, children
<>of S4aradva1n were known as Gautama and Gautami1.
<>(S4loka 2, Chapter 129, A1di Parva). Besides these,
<>Gautama had a daughter of unknown name. There is
<>a reference to this girl in s4loka 11 of Chapter 56 of
<>As4vamedha Parva. It is reported that this daughter
<>wept when Utan3ga a disciple of Gautama came to the

<>and Apara1ji1.
<NI>3) {%An attempt to kill Ahalya1.%} Once when Gautama was
<>away from the a1s4rama Indra came there as a guest.
<>Considering it as her duty to treat a guest of her
<>husband properly during his absence Ahalya1 received
<>him well and gave him fruit to ease his tiredness.
<>Indra went back. Gautama on knowing this on his
<>return suspected the chastity of his wife and calling
<>his son Ciraka1ri1 to his side asked him to cut off her
<>head. After giving the order Gautama went to the
<>forests.
<NI>Ciraka1ri1 had a peculiar nature. He will ponder over
<>things deeply before taking any action. He knew he must
<>obey the orders of his father but killing one's own
<>mother was a greater sin than disobeying a father.
<>Weighing the merits and demerits of the act Ciraka1ri1
<>sat thinking without doing anything.
<NI>Gautama when he reached the forest thought again
<>about Ahalya1 and her crime. After all what has she
<>done? A guest came to the a1s4rama and as duty bound
<>she welcomed him. It was indeed a great sin to have
<>killed her by her own son. Immersed in thoughts of
<>this kind, sad and repentant, Gautama returned to the
<>a1s4rama to find Ciraka1ri1 sitting silently deeply engross-
<>ed in thoughts. On seeing his father Ciraka1ri1 was
<>perplexed and he explained to his father about the good [Page286-a+ 64]
<>and bad effects of his order. Gautama was pleased at
<>this and he blessed him with long life.

<NI>(viii) Gautama was also one of the many sages who
<>visited Bhi1s2ma while he was lying on his bed of
<>arrows.
<NI>(ix) Once Gautama built a hermitage on the top of
<>the mountain Pa1riya1tra and did penance there for

<NI>x) Once Gautama turned the moustache of Indra
<>green by a curse for showing disrespect to him. (S4loka
<>23, Chapter 352, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(xi) When Gautama was born, there was such bri-
<>lliance that the surrounding darkness was removed and
<>so the boy was named Gautama (Gau=light rays,

<HI>GAUTAMA III. An ascetic of great erudition. He had
<>three sons named Ekata, Dvita and Trita. (See under
<>‘Ekata’). (S4loka 79, Chapter 36, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA IV. Another ascetic of great virtue. Once
<>when this Gautama was going through the forest he
<>saw an elephant babe lying wearied. He took it to his
<>a1s4rama and brought it up. When it became a full
<>grown elephant Indra disguised as the emperor
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came to take it away secretly. Gautama
<>found it out and then he was offered thousand cows
<>and much wealth in lieu of the elephant. But Gautama
<>refused to part with the elephant. Pleased with his
<>extreme affection for his dependant, Indra took both
<>Gautama and the elephant to heaven. (Chapter 102,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA. V. An ungrateful brahmin. He was born
<>in Madhyades4a. He left his parents and after travelling
<>in many lands he came to a country of foresters. The
<>foresters received him with respect and he lived in a
<>hut of the foresters and married a lady from among
<>them.
<NI>Gautama abandoned his brahminhood and accepted
<>the duties of foresters. He was living like this when
<>another brahmin boy came to that village. He searched
<>in vain for a brahmin house to stay for the night and
<>then knowing that a man born a brahmin but made
<>a forester by his duties was living there he went to his
<>house. Gautama also came there carrying the animals
<>and birds he had hunted down that day. His body
<>was bathed in blood. The brahmin guest felt com-
<>passion for Gautama and advised him to leave his
<>trade and go to his house in his country.
<NI>In the morning the brahmin guest went away without
<>taking any food. The advice of his guest kept him
<>thinking. He decided to abandon his life as a hunter
<>and so leaving everything behind he went to the sea-
<>shore. He met some merchants on the way and while
<>they were travelling together a wild elephant attacked
<>them. Many were killed and Gautama escaping ran
<>swiftly and came to the base of a big banyan tree.
<>He was tired and slept there for a while.
<NI>A big vulture named Na1d2i1jam3gha lived on the top of
<>that banyan tree. He used to go out to worship Brahma1
<>at dusk and when he returned to his abode that day
<>he saw a man lying wearied down below. Gautama
<>attempted to catch the vulture and eat it but the
<>vulture playing a benign host placed before Gautama
<>food for him and made enquiries about him and asked
<>him the purpose of his travels. Gautama told him that
<>he was very poor and that he wanted to acquire some
<>wealth somehow.
<NI>Na1d2i1jam3gha then said that he would get for him enough
<>wealth from the demon-King Viru1pa1ks2a who was an
<>intimate friend of his. Gautama was pleased. The
<>vulture fanned him and sent him to sleep. Next morn-
<>ing Na1d2i1jam3gha sent Gautama to Viru1pa1ks2a and the
<>demon gave Gautama as much gold as he could carry
<>on his shoulders.
<NI>Gautama took the gold as a head load and came back
<>to the base of the banyan tree. Na1d2i1jam3gha came to him
<>and they talked to each other for some time. Gautama
<>who had become a gluttonous flesh eater looked with
<>greed at the fat body of the vulture and in an instant [Page287-a+ 64]
<>killed it and packed the flesh along with the load of
<>gold and went his way.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a did not see Na1d2i1jam3gha for two days and he
<>was worried. He, therefore, sent his son to the banyan
<>tree to look for Na1d2i1jam3gha. When he reached the
<>base of the tree he found to his grief only the bones
<>and feathers of his father's friend. He knew what had
<>happened and he immediately followed the ungrateful
<>brahmin and capturing him brought him to his father
<>bound hand and foot. Viru1pa1ks2a without any mercy
<>cut him into pieces and threw them for the crows to
<>eat. But even the crows would not eat the flesh of such
<>an ungrateful man.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a burnt the remains of Na1d2i1jam3gha in a
<>funeral pyre. Devas assembled in the skies to watch
<>the funeral. Then Surabhi sprinkled milk on the
<>funeral pyre and brought back Na1d2i1jam3gha to life.
<>The reborn vulture felt sorry for Gautama and request-
<>ed Surabhi to restore to life the wretched Gautama
<>also. Gautama also was brought back to life and he
<>embraced Na1d2i1jam3gha. Gautama then went away with
<>his load of gold.
<NI>Gautama returned to S4abara1laya and there married a
<>S4u1dra lady and begot evil sons. The devas were
<>offended at this and cursing him condemned him to
<>hell. (Chapters 168 to 173, S4a1nti Parva).

<HI>GAVIJA1TA. (S4R2N3GI1). The son of a sage named
<>Na1gabhu1s2an2a, Gavija1ta cursed that King Pari1ks2it
<>should die of snake-bite. The curse was made under
<>the following circumstances.
<NI>King Pari1ks2it went hunting one day in the forest and
<>he who had chased a deer in hot haste for some dis-
<>tance felt naturally very weak and tired, and requested
<>a sage he saw there in the forest for some water.
<>Immersed in meditation the sage did not hear the King,
<>and mistaking him to be a haughty fellow, the King,
<>with his stick, lifted a dead snake and placed it round
<>the neck of the sage. Yet he did not stir. The King
<>returned to his palace. [Page287-b+ 65]
<NI>Gavija1ta, son of the sage and a devotee of Devi1 heard
<>of the insult heaped on his father's head while he was
<>merry-making in the forest with his companions. The
<>companions derided him by saying that though his
<>father was Na1gabhu1s2ana (having snakes as ornament)
<>the na1ga was I feless. Enraged at this and not waiting
<>to study details about the incident he pronounced the
<>following curse. “Whoever might be the person who
<>threw a dead snake about my father's neck, he will be
<>bitten to death by Taks2aka within seven days from
<>today.” Only after the curse was pronounced did he
<>understand that it was King Pari1ks2it who had become
<>the object of the curse. And, he despatched his disciple
<>immediately to Pari1ks2it to inform him about the curse.
<>The King's reaction was, “when the time for death
<>comes let me die.” (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Dviti1ya
<>Skandha).

<HI>GAYA1TI1RTHA. The following story is told in the Agni
<>Pura1n2a about the origin of this very reputed sacred
<>place at Gaya1.
<NI>An asura called Gaya was once performing
<>tapas here. As the intensity of his tapas went
<>on increasing, the Devas got nervous and they
<>approached Vis2n2u with the request that he should
<>save them from Gaya1sura. Vis2n2u agreed to oblige
<>them. Meantime the intensity of Gaya's tapas increa-
<>sed daily. Ultimately Vis2n2u appeared to Gaya and as
<>requested by him granted him the boon to the effect
<>that he would become more holy and sanctified than
<>all the ti1rthas in the world.
<NI>Brahma1 and other Devas became afraid of Gaya's
<>power and prowess and they complained about him to
<>Vis2n2u, who advised Brahma1 to request Gaya for his
<>body in order to perform a yajn5a. Brahma1 did so and
<>Gaya lay down on earth so that the Yajn5a might be
<>performed on his body. Brahma1 began the yajn5a on his
<>head, and made an offering when the body of Gaya
<>was not stationary or quiet. When told about this fact
<>Vis2n2u called up Dharmadeva (See Mari1ci, Para 3) and
<>told him thus: “You please hold devas4ila1 (a divine
<>stone) on the body of Gaya, and let all the Devas sit
<>upon it, and I shall be seated on the stone along with
<>the Devas, holding the gada1 (club) in my hands.”
<NI>Dharmadeva did as he was bidden by Vis2n2u. The body
<>of Gaya stopped shaking as soon as Vis2n2u sat upon the
<>stone, and Brahma1 made the full offerings. Thenceforth
<>the place became a holy tirtha under the name Gaya1.
<>After the yajn5a was over Brahma1 gave the Gaya temple
<>20,000 yards (5 Kros4a) in extent with 55 villages
<>attached to it as daks2in2a1 (fee) to the masters of the
<>ceremony. Brahma1 presented the villages to them after
<>creating therein hills purely of gold, rivers flowing
<>with milk and honey, houses built of Gold and silver
<>etc. But the brahmins who got these gifts stayed on
<>there, their avarice only on the increase perhaps.
<>Angry at this Brahma1 cursed the people of Gaya1, and
<>according to it the brahmins became illiterate and evil-
<>minded; rivers flowed with water instead of milk and
<>honey. The brahmins lamenting over their evil fate
<>submitted their grievances before Brahma1, who consol-
<>ed them thus: Well, brahmins of Gaya1, as long as
<>there exist the sun and the moon you will continue
<>to be dependent upon the Gaya1 ti1rtha for your sus-
<>tenance. Whoever comes to Gaya1 and gives offerings
<>to you and performs the due rites for the souls of the
<>departed, the souls of hundred generations of his
<>ancestors will be transfered from hell to heaven where
<>they will attain final beatitude.”
<NI>Thus did Gaya1ti1rtha become famous. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 144).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 I. One of the seven horses of Su1rya. The
<>other horses are Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1, Tris2t2ubh, [Page288-b+ 65]
<>Anus2t2ubh, and Pan3kti. (Chapter 8, Am3s4am 2, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 II.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A glorious Vedic mantra. This
<>mantra has twentyfour letters. There are nineteen
<>categories of movable and immovable things in this world
<>and to this if the five elements are added the number
<>twentyfour is obtained. That is why the Ga1yatri1 has got
<>twentyfour letters. (Chapter 4, Bhi1s2ma Parva). At the
<>time of Tripura dahana S4iva hung this Ga1yatri1 mantra
<>as a string on the top of his chariot (Chapter 34, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>2) {%The glory of Ga1yatri1.%} If one recites Ga1yatri1 once one
<>will be freed from all sins done at that time; if one
<>recites it ten times all the sins done on one day will be
<>washed away. Thus, if one recites it a hundred times
<>the sins of one month; thousand times, the sins of a
<>year; one lakh times, the sins of his life time; ten lakh
<>times, the sins of his previous birth; hundred lakh times,
<>the sins of all his births, will be washed away, If a
<>man recites it ten crore times he becomes a realised
<>soul and attains moks2a. (Navama Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How to recite Ga1yatri1.%} It should be recited sitting
<>still with your head slightly drawn downwards with
<>your right palm open upwards, with the fingers raised
<>and bent to give the shape of the hood of a snake.
<>Starting from the centre of the ring-finger and counting
<>down and going up through the centre of the small
<>finger and touching the top lines on the ring, middle and
<>forefingers, count down to the base of the forefinger,
<>you get number ten. This is how the number of recita-
<>tions is counted. This method is called the Karama1la1
<>(hand rosary) method. This is not the only method
<>that could be used. You can use a rosary made of
<>lotus seeds or glass beads. If you are using lotus seeds
<>you should select white seeds for the rosary. (Navama
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>GA1YATRI1STHA1NA. A sacred place of northern Bha1-
<>rata. If one spends one night here one will get the
<>benefit of giving away as gifts a thousand cows. (S4loka
<>28, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<HI>GERU. A mineral obtained from mountains. (S4loka 95,
<>Chapter 158, Vana Parva).
<HI>GH ({#G#}). This letter has two meanings: (1) Bell (2) a
<>blow or assault; striking or killing. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 348).
<HI>GHANAPA1T2HA. A particular system of Vedic studies.
<>There are four such systems. The system of separating
<>each word from conjunctions and combinations and
<>combining with the word just before and after it is
<>called Jat2a1pa1t2ha. Jat2a1pa1t2ha means joined or combined
<>Pa1t2ha. Ghanapa1t2ha is there to avoid errors in Jat2a1pa1t2ha
<>Ghanapa1t2ha consists of padapa1t2ha and Kramapa1t2ha.
<>In Padapa1t2ha the split words are once more combined
<>and Pra1tis4a1khya lays down the rules to combine words.
<>It is because of this scientific system of reciting that
<>the R2gveda remains to this day pure in text without
<>different readings.
<HI>GHAN2T2A. I. A brahmin born in Vasis2t2ha's family. He
<>spent hundred years worshipping S4iva. Once Ghan2t2a
<>asked sage Devala to give his daughter in marriage to
<>him. But Ghan2t2a's ugliness stood in the way. So he
<>abducted the daughter of the sage and married her.
<>Enraged at this Devala cursed and turned him into an [Page289-a+ 62]
<>owl. He was also given redemption from the curse that
<>he would regain his form the day he helped Indra-
<>dyumna. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>GHAN2T2A II. See under Ghan2t2a1karn2a.
<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A I.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ghan2t2a and Karn2a were two Ra1ks2asa bro-
<>thers who attained salvation by worshipping Vis2n2u.
<>(Bha1gavata, das4ama Skandha). But the elder brother,
<>Ghan2t2a alone is sometimes called by the name Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is a reference in Da1rukavadha (killing
<>of Da1ruka1sura) about the birth of Ghan2t2a1kar2n2a.
<>Da1ruka, after having secured a boon from Brahma1, used
<>to harass the world too much and when his depre-
<>dation hecame unbearable S4iva created Bhadraka1li1
<>from his third eye and she killed the asura. Mandodari1
<>wife of Da1ruka and daughter of Maya was sunk in
<>grief at the death of her husband. She began to do
<>tapas. S4iva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
<>from his body saying that the person on whom she
<>sprinkled the sweat drops would suffer from small-pox
<>and that such patients would worship her (Mandodari1)
<>and supply her necessary food. From that day onwards
<>Mandodari1 became the presiding deity over small-pox.
<>On her way back to the earth with the sweat-drops
<>Mandodari1 met Bhadraka1li1 at whom she threw the sweat-
<>drops to take revenge for her husband's death. Immedi-
<>ately Bhadraka1li1 fell down with an attack of small-pox.
<>Hearing about the mishap S4iva created a terrible
<>Ra1ks2asa called Ghan2t2a1karn2a. According to S4iva's
<>directions Ghan2t2a1karn2a licked off the small-pox from
<>Bhadraka1li1's body. But, when he tried to lick it off from
<>her face she prevented him saying that she and Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a were sister and brother and that it was improper
<>for the brother to lick the face of the sister. And, even
<>to this day the small-pox on Bhadraka1li1's face remains
<>as an ornament to her.
<NI>3) {%The name Ghan2t2a1karn2a.%} This Ra1ks2asa, at first, was
<>an enemy of Vis2n2u, and did not tolerate even the men-
<>tion of Vis2n2u's name. Therefore, he went about always
<>wearing a bell so that the tinkling of it warded off the
<>name of Vis2n2u from entering his ears. Because he wore
<>a ghan2t2a1 (bell) in his Karn2as (ears) he came to be
<>known as Ghan2t2a1karn2a. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 80).
<NI>4) {%Turned out to be a devotee of Vis2n2u.%} Ghan2t2a1karn2a
<>became a servant of Kubera. Once he did tapas for
<>salvation. S4iva appeared and asked him to do tapas to
<>please Vis2n2u as Vis2n2u was greater than himself (S4iva).
<>From that day onwards he removed the bells from his
<>ears and became a devotee of Vis2n2u. (Bhavis2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 80).
<NI>5) {%Attained salvation.%} Handing over charge of govern-
<>ment to Sa1tyaki S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once went to Kaila1sa moun-
<>ted on Garud2a to see S4iva. On his way he dismounted
<>at the Badarya1s4rama, and while sitting deep in medi-
<>tation there he heard the thundering voice of Pis4a1cas
<>(souls of dead people roaming about without attaining
<>salvation). He also heard the barking of dogs, and thus
<>he understood that Pis4a1cas were hunting animals. The
<>hunters came to Kr2s2n2a's presence. They were led by
<>Ghan2t2a1karn2a who was reciting the name of Vis2n2u. S4ri1 [Page289-b+ 64]
<>Kr2s2n2a felt pity for him. Ghan2t2a1karn2a told Kr2s2n2a that
<>his aim and ambition were to see Vis2n2u and that S4iva
<>had blessed that he would realise his ambition at
<>Badarya1s4rama. Pleased at all this, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a revealed
<>his Vis4varu1pa (representing in his person the whole
<>universe), and at once Ghan2t2a1karn2a brought half of the
<>corpse of a brahmin and submitted it as a present
<>before the Lord. He explained to Kr2s2n2a that according
<>to the custom of the Ra1ks2asas that was the best present
<>which could be made. Without accepting the present
<>Kr2s2n2a patted Ghan2t2a1karn2a on his back with the result
<>that he cast off his body and rose up to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Chapters 80-82 and also Bha1gavata,
<>Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>6) {%Ghan2t2a1karn2a Pratis2t2ha1.%} (Installation of his idol in
<>temples). Though Ghan2t2a1karn2a was a Ra1ks2asa, as he
<>attained Vaikun2t2ha due to the blessings of God Al-
<>mighty his idol is still installed in temples and wor-
<>shipped. The installation ceremony is described in
<>Chapter 59 of the Agni Pura1n2a thus: “Ghan2t2a1karn2a
<>should have 18 hands. He cures diseases born as a result
<>of sins. He holds in his right hand Vajra, sword,
<>Cakra, arrow etc. And in his left hand broom, sword, cord
<>bell, pickaxe etc. He also holds the tris4u1la (trident).
<NI>Ghan2t2a1karn2a who turned out to be a Deva is believed
<>to cure small-pox.
<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A II. One of the four attendants pre-
<>sented by Brahma1 to Subrahman2ya. Nandisena, Lohi-
<>ta1ks2a, Ghan2t2a1karn2a and Kumudama1li1 are the four
<>attendants. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verses 23-24).
<HI>GHAN2T2ODARA. An asura, who was a member of
<>Varun2a's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 9, Verse
<>134).
<HI>GHARMA. A King of the An3ga royal dynasty.
<HI>GHAT2A. An urban area in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 63).
<HI>GHAT2A. A notorious thief. He had a friend called
<>Karpara. They were jointly known as Gha1t2akarparas.
<>Once both the friends went to commit theft. Leaving
<>Ghat2a at the door-steps Karpara entered the chamber
<>of the princess who after enjoying sexual pleasures
<>with him gave him some money asking him to repeat
<>such visits in future. Karpara told Ghat2a all that had
<>happened and handed over to him the money which the
<>princess had given him. Karpara went again to the
<>princess. But, owing to the weariness caused by the
<>night's enjoyment both the princess and he slept till late
<>in the morning. Meantime the palace guards found out
<>the secret and took the lovers into custody. Karpara
<>was sentenced to death and led out to be hanged. Ghat2a
<>was present on the spot and Karpara asked him secretly
<>to save the princess. Accordingly Ghat2a, without any-
<>body knowing about it, took the princess over to his
<>house.
<NI>The King ordered enquiries about the absence of the
<>princess. Under the natural presumption that some
<>relation or other of Karpara alone might have carried
<>away his daughter the King ordered the guards of Kar-
<>para's corpse to arrest anybody who approached the
<>corpse and expressed grief. Ghat2a came to know of this
<>secret order of the King. Next day evening Ghat2a posing
<>himself as a drunkard and with a servant disguised as
<F>1. According to certain Pura1nas Ghan2t2a1karn2as are two individuals, Ghan2t2a and Karn2a. The term Ghan2t2a1karn2a--singular number--
<>is used because the brothers were inseparable from each other.</F> [Page290-a+ 65]
<>a woman walking in front and with another servant
<>carrying rice mixed with dhatu1ra1 (a poisonous fruit)
<>following him came to the guards keeping watch over
<>Karpara's body. Ghat2a gave the poisoned rice to the
<>guards who after eating it swooned under the effect.
<>Ghat2a used the opportunity to burn the corpse of
<>Karpara there itself. After that Ghat2a disappeared.
<NI>The King then deputed new guards to watch over the
<>funeral pyre of Karpara as he anticipated some one to
<>come to pick his charred bones from the pyre. But,
<>Ghat2a put the guards into a swoon by a mantra he had
<>learned from a sannya1sin and went away with the bones
<>of his friend.
<NI>Realising now that further stay there was not safe Ghat2a
<>left the place with the princess and the sannya1sin. But,
<>the princess, who had already fallen in love with the
<>sannya1sin poisoned Ghat2a to death.
<HI>GHAT2AJA1NUKA. A sage who was a prominent member
<>in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4).
<>Once, S4ri1 Krs2n2a, on his way to Hastina1pura met this
<>sage. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>GHAT2AKARPARA. One of the nine great poets in
<>Sanskrit reputed as the nine gems in Vikrama1ditya's
<>court.
<NI>“Dhanvantari--Ks2apan2ak A1marasim3ha--S4an3ku--Veta1la-
<>bhat2t2a--Ghat2akarpara--Ka1lida1sa1h2”. A poem of twen-
<>ty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghat2akarpara ka1vya is
<>attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message
<>despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently
<>been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating
<>a word or set of words to convey different meanings at
<>the end of each line). By composing a poem called
<>‘Nalodaya’, Ka1lida1sa answered the challenge posed by
<>Ghat2akarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghat2akarpara
<>answered Ka1lida1sa in the following stanza.
<Poem>Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te
<>nimajjati1ndoriti yo babha1s2e /
<>nu1nam na dr2s2t2am3 kavina1pi tena
<>da1ridryados2o gun2ara1s4ina1s4i1.</Poem>
<>(Ka1lida1sa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kuma1rasam3bhava
<>had written ‘Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te nimajjati1ndoh2
<>kiran2es2viva1n3kah2”. In the above verse by Ghat2akarpara
<>the usage ‘Kavina1pi tena’ may be interpreted in two
<>ways, viz. Kavina1+api+tena and Kavi+na1pitena. By
<>the second combination Ghat2akarpara converted Ka1li-
<>da1sa into a barber (na1pita).
<HI>GHAT2IKA1. A measure of time equal to 24 minutes.
<>Sixty vina1d2ika1s make one Ghat2ika1. (See Ka1lama1na).
<HI>GHAT2OTKACA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ghat2otkaca, son of Bhi1masena played a very
<>important part in the story of Maha1bha1rata. He was,
<>from his very birth, a staunch friend and ally of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He courted a hero's death in the great war.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} On the burning of the ‘lac Palace’ the
<>Pa1n2d2avas escaped through a tunnel and reached a forest.
<>While they were sleeping on the ground, Hid2im3ba the
<>Ra1ks2asa chief in the forest saw the Pa1n2d2avas from the
<>top of a tree, and he deputed his sister Hid2imbi1 to
<>bring over the Pa1n2d2avas to him for food.
<NI>Hid2im3bi1 approached the Pa1n2d2avas in the guise of a
<>beautiful woman. She was attracted towards Bhi1ma
<>and she prayed for the return of his love, which Bhi1ma
<>refused. Impatient at the delay Hid2im3ba rushed to-
<>wards the Pa1n2d2avas, and in the duel that ensued
<>between him and Bhi1ma, he was killed by Bhi1ma. [Page290-b+ 65]
<NI>Then Hid2im3bi1 approached Kunti1 and requested her to
<>ask Bhi1ma to marry her. The Pa1n2d2avas agreed to the
<>proposal on condition that Bhi1ma and Hid2im3bi1 should
<>enjoy their honeymoon in the forest and on mountains,
<>but Bhi1ma should return to them at dusk everyday.
<>Ghat2otkaca was the son born to Bhi1ma and Hid2imbi1,

<NI>Ghat2otkaca grew up to become a good friend of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. When Hid2im3bi1 and Ghat2otkaca took leave of
<>them Kunti1 said to Ghat2otkaca: “You are the eldest
<>son to the Pa1n2d2avas. You should be ever a support to
<>them.” To this Ghat2otkaca answered that he would
<>return to them whenever any need arose for it.
<NI>3) {%Carried the Pa1n2d2avas on shoulders.%} During their exile
<>in the forest the Pa1n2d2avas became too tired to walk any
<>further when Bhi1ma remembered Ghat2otkaca, who
<>promptly appeared before the Pa1n2d2avas, and at the
<>instance of Bhi1ma got down a number of Ra1ks2asas also.
<>Ghat2otkaca carrying Pa1n5ca1li1 on his shoulders, and the
<>Ra1ks2asas carrying the Pa1n2d2ava brothers on their
<>shoulders went by air to Badarika1s4rama where
<>Narana1ra1yan2as were doing tapas, landed them there,
<>and then they (Ghat2otkaca and his companions) took
<>leave of the Pa1n2d2avas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 145).
<NI>4) {%Ghat2otkaca in the great war.%} (1) In the first day's
<>fighting he fought against Alambus2a, Duryodhana and
<>Bhagadatta. Frightened at the terrible course of the
<>fight the Kauravas purposely postponed that day's
<>fighting. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapters, 45, 57, 58).

<NI>(14) Karn2a clashed with Ghat2otkaca and failing to
<>kill him by any means he (Karn2a) used Vaijayanti1
<>S4akti as the last resort. This S4akti had been given to
<>him by Indra in exchange for his head-gear and ear-
<>rings, and Karn2a had been keeping the S4akti in res-
<>erve to kill Arjuna. At any rate Karn2a used it against [Page291-a+ 65]
<>Ghat2otkaca and he was killed. After killing Ghat2ot-
<>kaca the S4akti entered the sphere of the stars. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 180).

<HI>GHOS2A1. A tapasvini1 famed in R2gveda. She was the
<>grand-daughter of Dr2gata mahars2i and daughter of sage
<>Kaks2i1va1n. As she contracted leprosy in her very child-
<>hood nobody came forward to marry her. Ultimately
<>she composed a mantra in praise of As4vini1devas. They

<HI>GHR2TA1CI1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} She was an exceptionally beautiful apsara1
<>woman, and she revelled in disturbing the peace of
<>the sages and becoming mother of children by them.
<>Ghr2ta1ci1, who succeeded in breaking the penance of
<>the sages like Kus4ana1bha, Vya1sa and Bharadva1ja
<>occupied a very prominent position among apsara1
<>women.
<NI>2) {%S4uka, the son of Vya1sa.%} Vya1sa longed very much to have
<>a son. Ultimately, after receiving instruction and advice
<>from Na1rada, he reached the peaks of Maha1meru and
<>worshipped Maha1deva and Maha1devi1 for one year
<>with the one-syllabled mantra OM which is the very
<>seed of word. By now the great tejas (effulgence) of
<>Vya1sa lighted up the whole world and Indra got ner-
<>vous and upset. The great Lord S4iva appeared on the
<>scene and blessed Vya1sa that he will have a son who
<>would become a very wise man, very much interested
<>in helping others, and very famous also. Vya1sa returned
<>gratified to his a1s4rama. One day, while in the process
<>of preparing the sticks for producing fire, thoughts [Page291-b+ 64]
<>about a son passed through his mind. Fire is produced by
<>the rubbing of two sticks. But, he thought, how
<>could he who had no wife, become the father of a son?
<>While immersed in such thoughts he saw Ghr2ta1ci1
<>standing near him, herself having come along the sky.
<>Vya1sa did not like the presence of Ghr2ta1ci1. Fearing
<>the curse of Vya1sa she assumed the form of a parrot and
<>flew away.
<NI>The beauty of Ghr2ta1ci1 as also the flight of the parrot
<>kindled erotic feelings in Vya1sa and seminal emission
<>occurred. The semen fell on the stick used for produc-
<>ing fire, and without knowing the fact he went on
<>using the sticks for producing fire. And, then did
<>appear from it a son of divine lustre. That son became
<>reputed in later years as sage S4uka. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Prathama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Two children by Bharadva1ja.%} Once sage Bharadva1ja was
<>taking his bath in the Gan3ga1, Ghr2ta1ci1 also came to
<>bathe. On the banks of the river her clothes caught
<>something and were removed from their position. The
<>sight of it caused seminal emission to the Sage. The
<>semen thus emitted was kept in a Dron2a, (bamboo cup)
<>and when it was due the Dron2a broke and out
<>of it came a child. It was this child which, in later
<>years, became so very famous as the great Dron2a1ca1rya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 149). On another occasion also,
<>the sight of Ghr2ta1ci1 caused emission in Bharadva1ja,
<>and S4ruta1vati1 or S4ruva1vati1 was the noble daughter
<>born out of it. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 63).
<NI>{%Hundred daughters of Kus4ana1bha.%} Kus4ana1bha, son of Kus4a
<>was a saintly king. Once Kus4ana1bha fell in love with

<>hundred girls, but they refused to satisfy his desire. So
<>he cursed them to become crooked or bent down in body.
<>Later on, Brahmadatta, son of the sage Cu1li, straightened
<>their bodies and married them. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Canto 32).
<NI>5) {%Birth of Ruru.%} On another occasion Ghr2ta1ci1 attract-
<>ed and subjugated a King called Pramati. Ruru was the

<>The next morning on finding no river in its place the
<>people were surprised. The news reached the ears of the

<>gave it a hard kick. It created a hole in the mountain
<>and the river flowed through it. But by that time
<>Kola1hala had got a son and a daughter of S4uktimati1.
<>Greatly pleased at the King for setting her free from

<>along with her companions. The very sight of the
<>enchanting Padma1vati1 roused carnal passions in him
<>and the Yaks2a took the form of Ugrasena and started
<>singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padma1vati1
<>went to him because she mistook him for her husband.
<>Embracing her passionately the Yaks2a outraged her
<>modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts
<>in Padma1vati1 and, on being questioned, the Yaks2a told
<>the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOHARAN2APARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of
<>Maha1bha1rata. See under ‘Maha1bha1rata’.

<HI>GOKARN2A1. In the great battle Karn2a sent a serpent-
<>missile against Arjuna. The serpent named As4vasena
<>was the power behind the missile and Gokarn2a1 was the
<>mother of that serpent. (S4loka 42, Chapter 90, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<HI>GOKARN2A. A sacred place of Pura1n2ic importance
<>situated on the extreme north of Kerala.
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} There was once on the banks of the river,
<>Tun3gabhadra1, a village made sacred and prosperous by
<>the brahmins who lived there. In that village lived a
<>noble brahmin named A1tmadeva. His wife was a
<>quarrelsome woman named Dhundhuli1. Even after many
<>years of married life they got no children and
<>A1tmadeva, greatly grief-stricken, left his home and
<>went to the forests. He was sitting on the shore of a
<>lake after quenching his thirst from it when a
<>Sannya1sin came that way. A1tmadeva told him about his
<>domestic life and pleaded that he should suggest a way to
<>get a son for him. The sannya1sin sat in meditation for
<>some time and contemplated on the horoscope of
<>A1tmadeva and regretfully informed him that according
<>to his horoscope he was to have no children for seven
<>successive births. He, therefore, advised A1tmadeva to [Page293-b+ 65]
<>abandon all his worldly pleasures and accept sannya1sa
<>for the rest of his life. But A1tmadeva was not to be
<>discouraged by this prophecy and he urged the
<>sannya1sin to help him somehow to get a child. The
<>sanya1sin then gave him a fruit and asked him to give it
<>to his wife and ask her to observe a life of fasting for a
<>period of one year.
<NI>Greatly pleased with this boon A1tmadeva returned to
<>his house and told his wife all that had happened and
<>gave her the fruit. She liked to eat the fruit but a
<>year's fasting seemed troublesome to her. She was
<>thinking of how to get over this difficulty when her
<>younger sister came to her and suggested a plan. She
<>said “Sister, I am pregnant. I shall give you the
<>child I deliver. You can declare it as your child and
<>make your husband believe so. You can announce in
<>public that you have eaten the fruit and have conse-
<>quently become pregnant. We can, to test its merit,
<>give the fruit to a cow.” Dhundhuli1 liked the plan very
<>much and so did everything like that.
<NI>The news that Dhundhuli1 was pregnant spread in the
<>city. Very soon her sister gave birth to a child and
<>that child was proclaimed as the child of Dhundhuli1. On
<>the pretext that Dhundhuli1 was short of breast-milk her
<>sister started doing the breast-feeding. The child was
<>named Dhundhuka1ri.
<NI>After three months the cow that ate the fruit delivered
<>a child. The ear of the child was like that of a cow
<>and so he was called Gokarn2a. Dhundhuka1ri and
<>Gokarn2a grew together. Dhundhuka1ri became a very
<>evil-natured boy while Gokarn2a grew into a scholarly
<>one. Dhundhuka1ri who was the very seat of everything
<>bad made the life of their parents wretched and the
<>disappointed A1tmadeva renounced all and went to the
<>forests and did penance and attained moks2a. Unable
<>to bear the torture by her son, Dhundhuli1 committed
<>suicide by jumping into a well. Gokarn2a started on a
<>pilgrimage.
<NI>Dhundhuka1ri lived in his own house surrounded by
<>prostitutes. Thieving was his only means of livelihood.
<>Knowing this the servants of the king started to capture
<>Dhundhuka1ri and the prostitutes who lived with him,
<>for their safety, bound Dhundhuka1ri with ropes and put
<>him into fire and killed him. The soul of Dhundhuka1ri
<>became a great phantom. Hearing the news of the
<>death of his brother, Gokarn2a returned home. He
<>conducted a s4ra1ddha at Gaya1 to give peace to the soul
<>of his departed brother. But the phantom of Dhundhu-
<>ka1ri was not pacified. This phantom troubled him
<>always. Gokarn2a was not afraid of it and asked him
<>what he wanted and the phantom pleaded that in some
<>way Gokarn2a should get him absolved of all his sins.
<>Gokarn2a then consulted Pandits to know what method
<>should be adopted to save a soul which could not be
<>saved even by a Gaya1-S4ra1ddha. The Pandits advised
<>him to do penance to propitiate the Sun. The Sun who
<>appeared before Gokarn2a as a result of his penance
<>declared that if he did read the entire Bha1gavata in
<>seven days Dhundhuka1ri would get moks2a. So Gokarn2a
<>performed a Sapta1ha and among those who assembled
<>to hear it was the phantom of Dhundhuka1ri also. The
<>phantom finding no place to sit crept into a seven-
<>layered bamboo and sat there listening to Gokarn2a.
<>When the first day was over the first layer broke and it
<>went on like that every day and on the seventh day the [Page294-a+ 63]
<>seventh layer broke and when Gokarn2a finished
<>the twelfth Skandha the phantom rose from the
<>bamboo to heaven. When it was going to heaven it
<>looked at Gokarn2a and told him that his moks2a was due
<>to the result of his hearing the sapta1ha reading. When
<>Gokarn2a asked him why none of the others who heard
<>it got it he said that it was because none had heard it
<>with such rapt attention as he had done.
<NI>Gokarn2a then conducted another reading of Sapta1ha
<>and the people present heard the same with rapt
<>attention. When the reading was over, a chariot of
<>Vis2n2u from Vaikun2t2ha descended and carried
<>away all those who heard the reading. The place
<>where Gokarn2a sat and read the Sapta1ha became
<>known later as the famous Gokarn2a. (Chapters 1 to 3,
<>Bha1gavata Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>2) {%Mitrasaha and Gokarn2a.%} A King of Ayodhya1 named
<>Mitrasaha who became famous by the name of
<>Kalma1s2apa1da, became a demon by a curse of Vasis2t2ha.
<>He attained moks2a by living and worshipping God in
<>the temple at Gokarn2a. (See under S4ivara1tri for
<>details).
<NI>3) {%Gokarn2a and the origin of Kerala.%} Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>gives a story associating Gokarn2a with the origin of
<>Kerala.
<NI>By the request of Bhagi1ratha the river Gan3ga1 fell on
<>earth and flowing as different brooks emptied its waters
<>in the ocean. The level of the water in the ocean went
<>up and the temple of Gokarn2a and the land of Kerala
<>were submerged in waters. The sages who were in the
<>temple somehow escaped and took refuge on the
<>mountain Sahya. Paras4ura1ma was doing penance there
<>then and the sages went to him and told him of their
<>plight. Paras4ura1ma went and stood in Gokarn2a and
<>threw an axe to the south. All the land from Gokarn2a
<>up to the place where the axe fell rose up from the
<>ocean to form a piece of land which was named Kerala.
<>(Chapter 97 of Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).

<>is found everywhere in R2gveda. The seventyfourth
<>su1kta in the thirteenth anuva1ka of the first man2d2ala of
<>R2gveda is composed by this sage. There are many other
<>su1ktas also in his name. This sage is not the Gautama,
<>husband of Ahalya1, who made Su1kta 58, Anuvaka 11,
<>Man2d2ala 1 of R2gveda.
<NI>Once this Gotama tired of thirst asked the Maruts for

<>Savana, Anagha, Sutapas and S4ukra. These holy men
<>were saptars2is in the third Manvantara. (Chapter 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOVARDHANA. A mountain of Amba1d2i (Gokula).
<>This is believed to be a form of Kr2s2n2a. This is called
<>Girira1ja also. The residents of Amba1d2i from time imme-
<>morial used to worship Indra for getting rains. But
<>after the advent of Kr2s2n2a there came a change in that
<>belief. Kr2s2n2a told them that rains depended on Govar-
<>dhana and it was enough if they worshipped that moun-
<>tain and so the residents of Amba1d2i started worshipping
<>the mountain. Indra got enraged at this and sent heavy
<>rains to Amba1d2i1 intending to submerge it in water. But
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a lifted the mountain over Amba1d2i like an um-
<>brella and saved the city from the wrath of
<>Indra. See under ‘Kr2s2n2a’ for more details. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata)
<HI>GOVA1SANA. A King of the country called S4ivi. The

<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>GOVIKARTA1. The man who puts nose-bands on
<>bullocks. (S4loka 9, Chapter 2, Vira1t2a Parva).
<HI>GOVINDA. A synonym of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a (Maha1vis2n2u). He
<>got this name because he saved the people and cows of

<>using it as an umbrella. (Da1ks2in2a1tya pa1t2ha Chapter
<>38, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>GOVINDADATTA. A brahmin of great fame who
<>resided in Bahusuvarn2aka, a city on the banks of the

<>had five children. Once when both the parents were
<>away from the house a sage called Vais4va1nara came
<>there but the children did not receive him and treat
<>him properly. Knowing this Govindadatta abandoned
<>all his children. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2halam3-

<HI>GOVRAJA. A soldier of Skandadeva. (S4loka 66, Chap-
<>ter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GRAHAS (PLANETS). Indians from very ancient days
<>have maintained certain definite ideas and inferences
<>about the planets. Though those ideas differ somewhat
<>from the results of modern researches, the influence of
<>the ancient ideas is discernible in all the Pura1n2ic texts in
<>India. The main ideas are summarised below.
<NI>Su1rya (Sun), Candra (Moon), S4ukra (Venus), Budha
<>(Mercury), Kuja (Mars), Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani
<>(Saturn), Ra1hu and Ketu are the navagrahas (the nine
<>planets).

<>Ketus4ceti navagraha1h2</Poem> [Page296-a+ 65]
<>Besides the above nine planets, Indian astronomers take
<>into account a starry sphere in the sky called Saptars2is
<>and the star called Dhruva.
<NI>1) {%Su1rya.%} The sun gives light to all the other planets.
<>It has an area of 50 crore yojanas and its distance from
<>the earth is 22 crore yojanas. S4u1rya exists within the
<>universe, and is called also Ma1rtan2d2a as it originated
<>from dead (mr2ta) egg (an2d2a). Su1rya divides the sky,
<>heaven, hell, the earth, east, west, north, south etc.
<>from one another. According to the course of Su1rya
<>three periods of time or ‘seasons’ like uttara1yan2a,
<>daks2in2a1yana and vis2uvat are caused. Five months from
<>May is the uttara1yan2a period, five months from
<>November the daks2in2a1yana period, and the months of
<>April and October are the Vis2uvats. Since during the
<>uttara1yan2a the sun rises up comparatively slowly
<>(mandagati) during this period the day is longer than
<>night. As in daks2in2a1yana the course of the sun is quic-
<>ker in pace (S4i1ghragati) night is longer than day, and
<>during vis2uvat, (samagati) day and night are of equal
<>duration.
<NI>The other planets have three positions called Jaradgava,
<>Aira1vata and Vais4va1nara, the first being the central
<>position, the second the northern position and the
<>third the southern position. Nine stars, As4vini1, Bharan2i1,
<>Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu and
<>Pus2ya occupy the Aira1vata vi1thi1 (northern position
<>or segment). Another nine stars, Magha1, Pu1rva
<>Phalguni1, Uttara Phalguni1, Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti1,
<>Vis4akha1, Anura1dha1 and Jyes2t2ha1 occupy the central
<>position, and the last nine stars, Mu1la, Purva1s2a1d2ha,
<>Uttara1s2a1d2ha, S4ravan2a, S4ravis2t2ha1, S4atabhis2ak, Pu1rva-
<>pros2t2hapada, Uttarapros2t2hapada and Revati1 occupy the
<>southern position.
<NI>To the east, south, west and north of Mount Maha1meru
<>exist Devadha1nika1 (Indrapuri1) Sam3yamani1 (Yamapuri1)
<>N3imlocani1 (Varun2apuri1) and Vibha1vari1 (Kuberapuri1)
<>respectively. When Su1rya appears in Devadha1nika1 it
<>will be dawn, when he has travelled to Sam3yamani1 it
<>will be noon, when he is in Nimlocani1 it will be sunset
<>and when he is in Vibha1vari1 it will be mid-night. This
<>is how S4urya circles the Maha1meru. Within 15 na1d2ika1s
<>(6 hours) the sun travels 2(1/2) crores plus 2(1/2) lakhs of
<>yojanas. Su1rya's chariot has one wheel and twelve
<>spokes. The wheel represents a year and the twelve
<>spokes stand for the twelve months of the year. The
<>chariot has also three na1bhis representing the three
<>ca1turma1syas, and six bands representing the six
<>seasons. The height of the chariot is 36 lakhs yojanas
<>and it has a width of 8 yojanas inside. Arun2adeva is the
<>charioteer, and the seven chandas are the horses. The
<>seven chandas are, Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1,
<>Tris2t2ubh, Anus2t2ubh and Pan3kti).
<NI>Night is called Us2a1 and day Vyus2t2i and the time in
<>between is Sandhya1. When Sandhya1 begins the terrible
<>Ra1ks2asas called Mandehas attempt to consume Su1rya.
<>They have been granted the boon that everyday they
<>will be dying though they may not be losing their
<>bodies. So, everyday there rages a fierce fight between
<>them and Su1rya. When the fight is on, noble brahmins
<>throw up water sanctified by Ga1yatri1 mantra with
<>‘Om’. The water turns into Vajra1yudha and burns the
<>Ra1ks2asas to ashes. The first offering in Agnihotra is
<>made with the recitation of the mantra beginning
<>‘Su1ryo Jyoti’ because of which the sun is able to shine [Page296-b+ 65]
<>with thousands of rays with the result that the Ra1ks2asas
<>are burned to death. The Ba1lakhilyas who number
<>more than 60,000 form Su1rya1's body-guard. (See under
<>Su1rya for Pura1n2i1c stories about him).
<NI>2) {%Candra. (The Moon).%} Candra exists at one lakh
<>yojanas away from Su1rya, and it revolves round the
<>earth. A ca1ndra month of twentyseven days is divided
<>into twelve ra1s4is (houses) viz. Sim3ha (Leo), Kanya1
<>(Virgo) Tula1 (Libra) Vr2s4cika (Scorpio) Dhanus
<>(Sagittarius) Makara (Capricorn) Kum3bha (Aquarius)
<>Mi1na (Pisces) Mes2a (Aries) Vr2s2abha (Taurus)
<>Mithuna (Gemini) and Karkat2aka (Cancer). Every
<>month Candra stays in each of the above houses only
<>for 2(1/4) days.
<NI>The full moon makes Pitr2s happy, divides the month
<>into two halves, Kr2s2n2a Paks2a (the dark fortnight)
<>and S4ukla Paks2a (the bright fortnight) and functions
<>as the very life of all living beings. The twentyseven
<>stars from As4vini1 to Revati1 are the wives of Candra.
<>There is another view that Candra has twentyeight
<>wives including another star called Abhijit. Candra has
<>another name, Sarvamaya. Candra with his pleasing
<>rays, as sweet as Amr2ta (Nectar) bestows happiness on
<>devas, Pitr2s and all other living beings. So he is called
<>Sarvamaya.
<NI>Candra's chariot has three wheels. Ten beautiful horses
<>white as Jasmine flowers draw the chariot. These
<>horses also like those of Su1rya live for a Kalpa era.
<>Because the Devas drink its digits Candra wanes into
<>one digit (Kala1). Then Su1rya makes him wax again
<>with one single ray of his called Sus2umna1. When only
<>two Kala1s of his remain Candra enters the orbit of
<>Su1rya and stays there in the ray called ‘ama1’, and that
<>day, therefore is called ama1va1sya1. And on that day
<>Candra enters waters for the first time, and after that
<>dwells in trees, creepers etc. While Candra is thus in
<>trees etc. those who cut them will be committing the
<>sin of brahmahatya1. (slaughter of a brahmin). When
<>only a little of the 15th kala1 remains on new moon day
<>hordes of Pitr2s gather round the enfeebled Candra to
<>drink him, and they drink the amr2ta kala1, one of the
<>two kala1s still remaining with him. Thus the three
<>classes of Pitr2s, Barhis2adas, Saumyas and Agnis2va1ttas
<>get absolutely satisfied for one month. Thus Candra
<>nurtures Devas in the S4ukla Paks2a and pitr2s in Kr2s2n2a
<>Paks2a, and grows trees, creepers etc. with life-giving
<>water. (For details see under Candra).
<NI>3) {%S4ukra (Venus).%} S4ukra is an auspicious Deva very
<>much interested in doing good to the world and making
<>people happy. His course is also, like that of S4u1rya, of
<>three types, intense (quick), slow and of equal pace.
<>Two-and-a-half yojanas above Su1rya, S4ukra follows a
<>course alternating in front of and behind Su1rya. S4ukra
<>never goes very far away from S4u1rya, and he possesses
<>a big chariot drawn by horses from earth. (For details
<>see under S4ukra).
<NI>4) {%Budha (Mercury).%} Though inherently auspicious
<>Budha, in contact with inauspicious planets takes their
<>character and becomes weak. Budha also has the three
<>paces, quick, slow and medium. Budha moves close to
<>Su1rya and if he moves from Su1rya storms, failure of
<>rain etc. will be the result. He is considered to be the
<>son of Candra. His chariot is made of wind and fire,
<>golden in colour and is drawn by eight horses having
<>the speed of wind. (See under Budha for more details). [Page297-a+ 65]
<NI>5) {%Kuja (Mars).%} Kuja is two lakhs of yojanas above
<>Budha, and remains in every ra1s4i (house) more or less
<>for 45 days. When the position is affected it causes
<>inauspicious experiences to living beings. The chariot
<>of Kuja is made of gold, glittering and of huge size.
<>Eight horses born from Agni draw the chariot.
<NI>6) {%Br2haspati (Jupiter).%} Jupiter travels 2 lakhs of yojanas
<>away from Kuja's sphere. Though it is an auspicious
<>planet its reverse course is productive of evil results.
<>Jupiter travels for twelve months in every ra1s4i (house).
<>His golden chariot is drawn by eight white horses. (See
<>Br2haspati).
<NI>7) {%S4ani (Saturn).%} S4ani is 2 lakhs of yojanas away from
<>Jupiter's sphere, and it stays in every house for twenty
<>months. As it moves only slowly it is called S4anais4cara
<>also. S4ani is considered to be the son of Su1rya. It is an
<>inauspicious planet. His chariot is drawn by multi-
<>coloured horses born in the sky.
<NI>8) {%Ra1hu.%} His ash-coloured chariot is drawn by eight
<>horses as dark as beetles. Once the horses are harness-

<>moon days Ra1hu starts from Su1rya and reaches Candra
<>and returns to Su1rya on new moon days. It is an inaus-
<>picious planet. (For details see under Ra1hu).
<NI>9) {%Ketu.%} His chariot is drawn by eight horses, which
<>have the speed of wind. It is also an inauspicious
<>planet.
<NI>10) {%Saptars2is.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the

<>are incessantly on the move in that sphere, wishing all
<>that is well for the whole world. (See Saptars2is).
<NI>11) {%Dhruva.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<>saptars2iman2d2ala there is a place called Vis2n2upada.
<>Dhruva, son of Utta1napa1da lives there in the company
<>of Indra, Agni, Kas4yapa, Dharma and others. The
<>Dhruvaman2d2ala remains there stationary like the
<>supporting pillar of all the planets ever on the move.

<NI>Astrologers aver that living beings pass through the
<>periods and positions of the following planets, viz. Ketu,
<>S4ukra (Venus) A1ditya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Kuja
<>(Mars), Ra1hu, Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani (Saturn) and
<>Budha (Mercury). The following table shows how
<>people born under different stars pass through the
<>different das4a1s. The order of succession of the das4a1s
<>and the period of each das4a1 can also be seen from this
<>table.
<NI>Stars (Day of birth)
<F>1. To find out your das4a1 at the time of birth, please see the above table. Any one born under any of the stars is considered born
<>in the das4a1 shown in the right hand side against that star; e. g. People born under (As4vayuk) As4vini1, Mr2gas4i1r2s2a and Mu1la are born
<>into the Ketu das4a1. So with the other stars also as shown in the above table. To calculate how long the das4a1 into which a particular person
<>is born will last requires some astrological skill; also the exact time of birth should be known. A star remains dominant for about 24
<>hours. If a man is born under a star when half this period of dominance is over, then that man will get only half the period of the corres-
<>ponding das4a1. The portion of the das4a1 that the man will get is proportionate to the period of dominance of the star. For example,
<>a man is born under the star As4vaini1 (As4vyuk) when the star is in the last quarter of the Ketu das4a1. The total period of this das4a1 is
<>7 years. But the man will get only the last quarter of it, namely about 1(3/4) years. After that he will pass on to the next das4a1--S4ukra-
<>das4a1.</F> <C2>Das4a1 <C3>Years

<HI>GRA1MADEVATA1. India is predominantly a rural
<>country with a number of villages, and the rural folk
<>depend mainly upon agriculture for living. Agricultural
<>land, rain and epidemics which affect them as well as
<>their cattle--these are the main concern of the villagers.
<>Indians, from very ancient days, used to believe that
<>each of the above has its own presiding devata1s. Such
<>devata1s are the gra1madevata1s.
<NI>Devi1 is the chief gra1madevata1 of South India. Devi1 is
<>called Durga1 and Ka1li1 also. But, Devi1 is worshipped in
<>sixtyfour different forms or aspects. The gentle Devi1,
<>viz. in her gentle aspect or attitude has three forms,
<>Kanya1, Ka1ma1ks2i1, and Mu1ka1mbika1. In Kerala Devi1 is
<>called Bhagavati1 also. Valiyan3ga1d2i Bhagavati1 of
<>Calicut is Laks2mi1devi1. Ka1li1 temples in Karn2a1t2aka are
<>called ‘Kot2t2a1puram3 Laks2mi1 Ks2etras’. There are such [Page299-b+ 64]
<>temples in Andhra also. Most of them are Jokula1mbika1
<>temples. In Tamil Nadu there are gra1madevata1s called
<>Mariyamma, Ka1li1yamma, and Draupadi1yamma. Not
<>the Draupadi1 mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata; but the
<>Kan2n2aki1 of Cilappadika1ra is the Devi1 worshipped in
<>Tamil Nadu.
<NI>There are two kinds of Devi1s called Saptama1tr2s and
<>Saptakanya1s. Saptama1tr2s have purus2as (husbands) and
<>saptakanya1s have seven brothers for help and support.
<>Devi1 pu1ja1 is very much prevalent in South India. The
<>custom is supposed to be as old as 5000 B.C. Idols of
<>Devi1 have been unearthed from Mohanjo-daro and
<>Harappa. Even the Buddhists worship the Devi1s called
<>Yaks2i1 and Ha1ri1ti1. When in after years Hinduism was
<>revitalised these gra1madevata1s got promoted as the
<>great Devata1s of the epics and the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ra1ma1yan2a mentions the incident of the Devi1 called
<>Lan3ka1laks2mi1 driving away Hanu1ma1n. There are famous
<>Ka1li1 temples in Ujjayini1 and Calcutta. It is believed
<>that in the temple at Cidambaram also Ka1li1 occupied
<>a prominent place. But, according to legends, S4iva
<>defeated Ka1li1 in a dance competition and ousted her to
<>her present temple at the outskirts of the city. Ca1mun2d2i1
<>is worshipped as the ancestral guardian deity in Mysore.
<>The Ka1ma1ks2i1 temple of Ka1n5ci1, Mi1na1ks2i1 temple of
<>Madura and Mu1ka1mbika1 temple of North Karn2a1t2aka
<>may be cited as examples for the worship of the gentle
<>form of Devi1. Alarmel Man3katta1ya1r temple at
<>Tirucca1nu1r is a very important Devi1 temple. The
<>‘Aditi’ in the Vedas and Kot2t2ravai of Tamil San3gha
<>texts point to the very long past of the Devi1 in India.
<>Ka1lida1sa and Ka1lamegha (a Tamil poet of the
<>fifteenth century have worshipped Ka1li1. S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa and the great modern Tamil poet
<>Bha1rati1 were devotees of Ka1li1.
<NI>There are also gra1madevas worshipped like the gra1ma-
<>devata1s. Muni1s4vara and Karuppan are two prominent
<>gra1madevas. In certain villages Bhairava, Vi1ra Irula,
<>Ka1t2t2eri and Non3gi are worshipped as gra1madevas. In
<>South Karn2a1t2aka a set of Devas called Bhu1tas are
<>worshipped, Pan5curuli being one of them. S4a1sta1 or
<>Ayyappa is another gra1madeva. S4a1sta1 is most popular
<>in Kerala and in Tamil Na1d2u. Buddha also is called
<>S4a1sta1. In certain places idols of S4a1sta1 with two wives,
<>called Pu1rn2a1 and Pus2kala1 are also found. S4abarimala
<>S4a1sta1 is yogamu1rti (in yogic pose).
<NI>In most of the gra1madeva temples idols of the Devas
<>are not found. A pi1t2ha (stool-like seat) is supoosed as
<>the seat of the Deva and it represents the Deva also.
<>But, in some temples weapons like the sword, the club
<>etc. are found. Offerings to the deity in gra1maks2etras
<>and annual festivals are common in such temples. (Na1m
<>van2amgum3 daivam3gal-Tamil).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1. A bhu1tagan2a (set of attendants) of S4iva.
<>Sins of those who worship this gan2a will be removed.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 25).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1YA. One born in the family of the Ks2atriya,
<>who is the governor of village. Nakula defeated the
<>gra1man2i1yas during the conquest of lands in connection
<>with the as4vamedha of Dharmaputra. (Sabha1 Parva;
<>Chapter 32, Verse 9).
<HI>GRANTHIKA. Name assumed by Nakula during his
<>life incognito at the Vira1t2a palace. (Vira1t2a Parva,
<>Chapter 3, Verse 4). [Page300-a+ 65]
<HI>GR2DDHRAKU1T2A. A mountain of northern India. The
<>Lam3s4u1ras gave protection to Br2hadratha at this moun-
<>tain. (S4loka 82, Chapter 49, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRAPATRA. A soldier of Skandadeva, (S4loka
<>74, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRAVAT2A. A mount of the Hima1layas. This
<>mount is the abode of Maha1deva. Those brahmins who
<>visit this place would get moks2a and those of other
<>castes would be absolved of all sins. (S4loka 91, Chapter
<>84, Vana Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRIKA1. A bird. Kas4yapa begot of his wife
<>Ta1mra1, the six birds namely Ka1ki1, S4yeni1, Bha1si1,
<>Gr2ddhrika1, S4uci and Gri1va1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>19)
<HI>GREEK LITERATURE. Greek is one of the most
<>important Indo-European languages. As an indepen-
<>dent branch of the original Indo-European language
<>Greek established itself by about 2000 B.C. Even
<>during its earliest period Greek had four local dialects
<>as a result of the arrival of the Greek-speaking people
<>at different periods of time. Iolic, Ionic-Attic, Arcado
<>Cyprean and western Greek are the four dialects.
<>Iolese was prevalent in the Lesbos region, and this is
<>the dialect mainly used in the poetry of Homer. The
<>Ionic and Attic dialects were prevalent in Ionia and
<>Attica respectively. After Homer, the major portion of
<>Greek literature was written in this dialect. The
<>Arcado-Cyprean dialect was used in Arcadio and
<>Cyprus. The fourth dialect was also called Doric.
<NI>Naval traditions, commerce and political power con-
<>tributed to the growth and development of Greek
<>language and literature. In each dialect, even from the
<>very beginning, literary efforts were made. Each of the
<>four spoken languages very soon developed into a
<>written language. But, in the very initial periods each
<>of the spoken dialects continued its existence in the
<>form of ballads and songs transferred from one man to
<>another. It was Homer who gave those popular ballads
<>an epic form and status and sowed the seeds of the
<>great literature of Greece.
<NI>The golden period of Greek literature was when the
<>city of Athens enjoyed supreme political power.
<>Literature during the period set the model for future
<>generations. It was during this period that Greek
<>achieved the best in different literary forms like tragedy,
<>comedy, lyric, elegy, history, philosophy, oratory etc.
<>Pindar, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Sophocles-Euripides,
<>Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and Demosthenes--
<>these are distinguished names who were responsible for
<>the great development of the literary forms referred to
<>above.
<NI>Greek literature passed the Alexandrian, Roman and
<>Byzantian periods before it arrived at the modern
<>period. It was Solomos and Valoritus and others who
<>gave impetus and inspiration to modern Greek litera-
<>ture.
<NI>GR2HADEVI1. Another name of the demoness Jara1.
<>(See under Jara1).
<HI>GR2HAPATI. A sage. There is a story in S4iva Pura1n2a
<>about this sage.
<NI>Vis4va1nara father of Gr2hapati was living with his wife
<>S4ucis2mati1 in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<>Narmada1. They had no children and S4ucis2mati1, was
<>grieved much on this account. She requested her husband
<>find out ways and means to get a child. Vis4va1nara, [Page300-b+ 64]
<>went to Ka1s4i1 and did penance to propitiate Vis4ves4vara
<>and the God appeared before him and blessed him and
<>said: “You will soon get a son”. Very soon the wife
<>of Vis4va1nara delivered a child and the son was named
<>Gr2hapati. When the child was nine years old Na1rada
<>came there once and warned them against fire. Vis4va1-
<>nara immediately went and did penance to propitiate
<>S4iva and obtained from him for his son the qualities of
<>fire also so that fire would be unable to act on him. It
<>was on account of this that Gr2hapati when he installed
<>an idol of S4iva at Ka1s4i1 gave it the name of Agni1s4vara.

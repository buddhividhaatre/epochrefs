<HI>JALAPRADA1NIKA PARVA A sub section of Stri1
<>Parva, of the Maha1bha1rata. This sub section comprises
<>of Chapters 1 to 15 of Stri1 Parva.
<HI>JALAPRALAYA. In all the Asiatic Pura1n2as, reference
<>to an ancient great flood, with slight changes occurs.
<>According to Hindu Pura1n2as this great flood took place
<>before Maha1vis2n2u took the incarnation of Matsya. In
<>the Holy Bible which is the scripture of the Christians,
<>the story of the great flood is allied to the story of the
<>Noah. (See under Avata1ra). This story occurs in the
<>Babylonian literature also. The book ‘Gilgamish’ which
<>is as old as the R2gveda, is considered to be the oldest
<>in the world. The theme of the Gilgamish is the travel [Page339-a+ 65]
<>of a man named Gilgamish. This story is written in
<>twelve clay-tablets. After 1850, the scientists of England
<>who carried on an archaeological research, found in the
<>library of Ancient Nineveh, the most famous in the
<>ancient world, these twelve tablets along with twenty-
<>thousand other tablets, all of which were in good condi-
<>tion. This library was built by the King As4urba1nipa1l
<>in 7th century B.C., on a very high place on the bank
<>of the river Tigris, in the ancient Nineveh.
<NI>All these clay tablets have been removed to the British
<>Museum. It took several decades to decipher them.
<>When these clay tablets were discovered there was not a
<>single man who could read and understand them, in
<>the world. In spite of hard work, several years passed
<>by without getting even a single tablet deciphered. They
<>were written in ‘Accadean’, which was the language
<>of the court of As4urba1nipa1l and the national and the
<>international language of the time. Another copy of
<>this great work was discovered on the bank of the Eu-
<>phrates, where the capital of the famous King Ha1mu-
<>ra1bi of Ancient Babylon stood. Later discoveries dis-
<>closed that this great work Gilgamish was part and
<>parcel of the famous ancient civilization of the Oriental
<>countries. The Hittites and the Egyptians tried to trans-
<>late this book Gilga1mish into their own languages. In
<>the tablets with letters in the form of arrow heads, found
<>on the bank of the Nile, the portions which were diffi-
<>cult for them to translate, are given red marks.
<NI>It was from a small piece of broken clay tablet that
<>clues to the origin of this famous work were obtained.
<>The world is indebted to the Sumerians, who had their
<>capital in the place where the city Ur stands, for the
<>original work of Gilgamish.
<NI>Mention is made about a great flood in Gilgamish, as
<>follows: Gilgamish set out on an adventurous journey to
<>see his ancestor Utna1pis2t2im to learn from him the means
<>of obtaining eternal life. The gods had told this man
<>about the secret of eternal life. At last Gilgamish reached
<>an island and found out his ancestor and asked him
<>about the secrets of eternal life. Utna1pis2t2im said that
<>he had lived in ‘S4hoorappak’ and that he had been an
<>ardent devotee of ‘Iya’ God. When the gods decided
<>to destroy mankind by a great flood the God Iya called
<>his devotee Utna1pis2t2im and said to him “You, man of
<>shoorappak, the son of U1rba1rtu1tu1: Demolish your house
<>and build a ship. Leave off your wealth and search for
<>your life. Cast away your property and save your life.
<>Bring the seeds of every living thing into the ship. The
<>ship you build should be according to measurements.”
<>The rest of the story is like the story of the “Ark of
<>Noah”. The scientists are of opinion that in pre-historic
<>times the three continents of Asia, Europe and Africa
<>were one continent and that by earthquake or some
<>other reason the south part of Europe had sunk down
<>and water flowed in and thus the mediterranean sea
<>came into existence. At a time when the far off regions
<>of the earth were unknown, the people who escaped
<>the flood imagined that the entire world had been sub-
<>merged by the flood. It could be imagined that this
<>story of the great flood passed on to posterity verbally
<>and after so many generations it appeared in different
<>regions in different languages in different forms.

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order are: Brahma1--Bhr2gu--Cyavana--Aurva--
<>R2ci1ka--Jamadagni.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is an interesting story about the birth
<>of Jamadagni. Ga1dhi was the son of king Kus4a1m3ba. A
<>daughter named Satyavati1 was born to Ga1dhi. The
<>hermit Rci1ka giving a dowry of one thousand horses,
<>each with one black ear, married Satyavati1. Once
<>Satyavati1 told her husband that herself and her mother
<>wanted to get a child each. After the sacrifice of obla-
<>tions to Agni (fire), R2ci1ka took two parts filled with
<>boiled rice and gave them to Satyavati1, with mantras
<>(spells). The radiance of Brahma1 was invoked into
<>one pot and the radiance of Ks2a1tra was invoked into
<>the other. The hermit had asked Satyavati1 to eat the
<>rice into which the radiance of Brahma1 had been in-
<>voked and to give the other pot to her mother. But the
<>daughter and mother changed the pots secretly and
<>Satyavati1 ate the rice in the pot into which Ks2a1tra radi-
<>ance was invoked and gave the pot of rice filled with
<>Bra1hma-radiance to her mother. Both the women con-
<>ceived. As the child grew in the womb the radiance of
<>Brahma1 shone on the face of the mother and Ks2a1tra
<>lustre was seen on the face of Satyavati1, Rci1ka asked
<>Satyavati1 for the reason. She admitted the secret inter-
<>change of the pot.
<NI>Satyavati1 and her mother both delivered at the same
<>time. Satyavati1 got the son Jamadagni, who was the
<>embodiment of Ks2a1tra tejas and the child with Bra1hma
<>tejas born to the mother was Vis4va1mitra. Therefore, in
<>some Pura1n2as Vis4va1mitra is described as the uncle of
<>Jamadagni whereas in some others they are said to be
<>brothers. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 57).
<NI>3) {%A house-holder.%} When Jamadagni grew up he made
<>a tour and visited the holy places one by one and
<>reached the palace of King Prasenajit of the family of
<>Iks2va1ku. He saw Ren2uka1 the beautiful daughter of
<>King Prasenajit and fell in love with her. He requested
<>Prasenajit for the hand of Ren2uka1. The King, without
<>raising any objection gave his daughter Ren2uka1 in
<>marriage to Jamadagni. The couple came to the bank [Page340-a+ 61]
<>of the river Narmada1 and erecting a hermitage began
<>‘tapas’ (penance). Four sons, R2uman2va1n, Suhotra, Vasu
<>and Vis4va1vasu were born to Jamadagni by Ren2uka1.
<>(Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 58).
<NI>4) {%The birth of Parus4u ra1ma.%} Because of the wickedness
<>of the Ks2atriya Kings, the goddess Earth became
<>miserable. She made a representation to Brahma1 who
<>took her to the sea of Milk and told Maha1vis2n2u every-
<>thing. Maha1vis2n2u promised to take an incarnation as
<>the son of Jamadagni and destroy all the wicked Kings.
<>Accordingly Ren2uka1 gave birth to Paras4ura1ma, who
<>was an incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 59).
<NI>5) {%Jamadagni getting the bow of Vis2n2u.%} Once the devas
<>(gods) desired to know who, of S4iva and Vis2n2u was
<>the more powerful. They informed Brahma1 of their
<>desire. Brahma1 asked Vis4vakarma1 to make two tremen-
<>dous bows. He gave one to S4iva and the other to
<>Vis2n2u. The bow which Vis2n2u got was known as Vais2n2a-
<>vaca1pa and that which S4iva got was known as
<>S4aivaca1pa. After this Brahma1 caused enmity between
<>S4iva and Vis2n2u. A terrible battle ensued between S4iva
<>and Vis2n2u. After a while the S4aivaca1pa became
<>less effective. At the request of the devas, the fight was
<>stopped. The devas decided that Vis2n2u was superior to
<>S4iva, in power. S4iva got angry at this decision and
<>gave his bow to Devara1ta Janaka, the King of Videha.
<>It was this bow that S4ri1 Ra1ma broke at the marriage
<>of Si1ta1.
<NI>Seeing that S4iva had given away his ca1pa (bow)
<>Maha1vis2n2u gave his bow to his devotee, the hermit
<>R2ci1ka. That Vais2n2ava ca1pa was given to Jamadagni
<>by R2ci1ka. Thus the famous Vais2n2ava ca1pa arrived at
<>the hermitage of Jamadagni. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 75).
<NI>6) {%Ren2uka1 was killed.%} Paras4ura1ma became fourteen
<>years old. Jamadagni went to the forest to gather
<>fruits, roots etc. After completing the cleansing work
<>of the hermitage, leaving Paras4ura1ma in the forest,
<>Ren2uka1 went to the bank of the river Narmada1 (Reva1)
<>to fetch water. When she reached the river, Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna and his wives were playing in water. She
<>waited for them to go. When they were gone she got
<>into the river. But as the water was muddy because of
<>the play, she walked a little to the east where there
<>was pure water. She saw there Citraratha the King
<>of Sa1lva playing with his wife in the water. How
<>beautiful they were! She had never seen so beautiful a
<>woman or so handsome a man. She stood there looking
<>at them for a while. When she reached the hermitage
<>with water, Jamadagni had already returned a long
<>while ago. He had returned weary and tired of the
<>heat of the midday-sun. He did not see his wife in
<>the hermitage. He had been sitting very angry when
<>Ren2uka1 returned with water. She put the pot down
<>and bowed before her husband and told him the reason
<>for her being late. When he heard the reason his anger
<>blazed. He called his sons one by one and ordered
<>them to kill her. But the four elder sons did not dare
<>to execute his order saying that slaughter of a woman
<>was a great sin. But Paras4ura1ma came forward and [Page340-b+ 64]
<>by a cutting-arrow cut off the head of his mother. The
<>father called the four sons who disobeyed him and
<>cursed them thus:
<NI>“Since you have disobeyed the order of your father,
<>because of your ignorance, you shall become foresters
<>and live in forest.”
<NI>Being overwhelmed with sorrow at the death of his
<>mother, Paras4ura1ma swooned and fell down. When
<>his anger subsided, discretion dawned on Jamadagni.
<>He aroused his son and took him on his lap and asked
<>him what boon he wanted for having accomplished
<>the unaccomplishable task. Paras4ura1ma's request
<>was that his mother should be brought to life again.
<>The hermit was pleased and he brought Ren2uka1 to
<>life again. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 60).

<>under the word Cerippu (Sandals).
<NI>8) {%The temptation of Dharma.%} See under the word
<>‘Dharma’ Para 6.
<NI>9) {%Jamadagni was killed.%} Once Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna, with
<>his minister Candragupta and some attendants had
<>been hunting in the forests on the banks of the river
<>Narmada1. It was noon. The hunters grew tired of
<>hunger and thirst. They came to the hermitage of
<>Jamadagni. The hermit called his divine cow Sus4i1la1
<>and ordered her to give food to the King and his party.
<>Within a few seconds meals were got ready for
<>thousands of people. The King and his attendants had
<>a feast. On their return journey the wonderful cow
<>Sus4i1la1 was the subject of their talk. The King wanted
<>to get the cow which possessed divine power. So he
<>sent his minister Candragupta to the hermitage of
<>Jamadagni with instructions to get the cow Sus4i1la1 in
<>exchange for a crore of cows or even half of the
<>kingdom. But the hermit was not prepared to give
<>the cow. The minister and his men caught the cow
<>by force and went away. The hermit, filled with grief,
<>followed the party a long way through the forest, and
<>requested Candragupta to return the cow. Candra-
<>gupta got angry and struck him to death, and took the
<>cow to the palace, in the capital city of Ma1his2mati1.
<NI>After waiting for a long time, Ren2uka1 started in search
<>of her husband. She saw Jamadagni lying almost dead,
<>in a pool of blood. She fell down and beating her
<>breast cried aloud. Paras4ura1ma with Akr2tavran2a and
<>other disciples came there. When she saw her son
<>Paras4ura1ma, she beat her breast twentyone times
<F>1) Seeing his mother beating her breast twentyone times, Bha1rgava caught hold of her hands and said “Mother, stop
<>afflicting your body. Don't be sorry. I am here to end your sorrow. Since you have beaten your breast twentyone times, I will annihilate
<>the Ks2atriya Kings twentyone times.” Bha1rgava Ra1ma took an oath thus, to his mother.</F>
<>and cried. Paras4ura1ma, took an oath that since his
<>mother beat her breast twentyone times and cried, he
<>would travel around twentyone times and put an end
<>to the Ks2atriya Kings. After that they took the dead
<>body of Jamadagni and placed it on fire, and began to
<>sing the song of Vis2n2u. Then the hermit S4ukra came
<>by that way and with the help of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1
<>brought Jamadagni to life again. The lost cow Sus4i1la1
<>also returned without her calf. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 69; M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 49).
<NI>10) {%Death of Jamadagni.%} Paras4ura1ma and Akr2tavran2a
<>went to the city of Ma1his2mati1 with the intention of
<>bringing the calf of Sus4i1la1 back. They stood at the
<>gate of the city and challenged Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna for a [Page341-a+ 63]
<>fight. Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna came out with his army. In
<>the battle which ensued, Ka1rtavi1rya and his sons and
<>most of his warriors fell dead. Paras4ura1ma and
<>Akr2tavran2a returned with the calf. Jamadagni asked
<>Paras4ura1ma to go to Mahendragiri and do penance in
<>order to mitigate the sin of killing a large number of
<>people. When Paras4ura1ma had gone for penance,
<>S4u1rasena a son of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna came with his men
<>to the hermitage, cut off the head of Jamadagni and
<>took it away. Paras4ura1ma and the disciples of
<>Jamadagni placed the dead body of Jamadagni on the
<>pyre and burnt it. Ren2uka1 jumped into that fire and
<>died. After this Paras4ura1ma began his twentyone
<>tours for the extermination of the Ks2atriya Kings.

<HI>JA1MAGHA. A King of the family of Yaya1ti. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 9).
<HI>JA1MBAVA1N. A monkey of extraordinary might. He
<>was the minister of Sugri1va.
<F>1) It is difficult to ascertain whether Ja1mbava1n was a monkey or a bear. In some of the Indian languages he is descri bed as a
<>monkey. In Malaya1lam3 he was thought of as a monkey from ancient period. In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, which is the original work, Ja1mba-
<>va1n is denoted by the words ‘Kapi’ (monkey) and Rks2a (bear). Ja1mbava1n is called R2ks2apun3gava in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a Ba1laka1n2d2a
<>Sarga 17. From this it is to be assumed that Ja1mbava1n was a bear. In the same chapter it occurs that, it was the aim of Brahma1 to
<>make the gods and the celestial women take birth as monkeys to help Maha1vis2n2u in the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma. So it is not
<>wrong to consider Ja1mbava1n either as a bear or as a monkey.</F>
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} When the troubles and hardships caused by
<>the wickedness of Ra1van2a became unbearable the
<>goddess Earth and the Devas approached Brahma1 for
<>redress. Brahma1 took them to the sea of Milk. Maha1-
<>visn2u heard everything and said that he would incarnate
<>as the son of Das4aratha and would kill Ra1van2a. Brahma1
<>was directed to create monkeys to help him on that
<>occasion. Accordingly Brahma1 created Ja1mbava1n and
<>several other monkeys. [Page341-b+ 59]
<>There are two stories about the birth of Ja1mbava1n in the
<>Pura1n2as.
<NI>(1) Brahma1 sat for a long time thinking about the
<>creation of monkeys. Then he wanted to yawn., for
<>which he opened the mouth and instantly Ja1mbava1n
<>came out from inside Brahma1 through the open mouth.
<>“I have already created Ja1mbaya1n the noble bear, who
<>jumped out of my mouth when I yawned.” (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 17, Stanza 6).
<NI>(2) One day time of Brahma1 ended and the night had
<>advanced two ya1mas (six hours). The Madhukait2abhas
<>born of the ear-wax of Maha1vis2n2u began to create
<>trouble and commotion in the waters of the great flood.
<>They saw a lotus on the surface of water. Seeing Brahma1
<>in it they challenged him for fight. Hearing their shout-
<>ing and the challenge Brahma1 became afraid of the
<>asuras. His middle face began to sweat. The sweat
<>flowed through his cheeks and reached the loins. Ja1mba-
<>va1n came into being from that sweat. So he got the
<>name Ambuja1ta, (born from the water of sweat). As
<>he was the first person who entered the country of
<>Ja1mbu1nada he was called Ja1mbava1n. As he was born
<>when there was no universe or time his age or date
<>of birth could not be ascertained. At the time of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma Ja1mbava1n was six Manvantaras (age of a Manu)
<>and for hundred and sixtyfour Caturyugas (a period of
<>four yugas) old. (The present age is the twentyeighth
<>Caturyuga of the seventh Manu). Ja1mbava1n had wit-
<>nessed all the incarnations from Matsya to S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>(Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a Pu1rva Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Ja1mbava1n and the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma.%} During the
<>time of S4ri1 Ra1ma Ja1mbava1n was the minister of
<>Sugri1va. It is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1
<>Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 41, that Ni1la, the son of Agni, Hanu1ma1n,
<>Ja1mbava1n, Suhotra, Sara1ri, S4aragulma, Gaja, Gava1ks2a,
<>Gavaya, Sus2en2a, R2s2abha, Mainda, Dvivida, Vijaya,
<>Gandhama1dana, Ulka1mukha, Asan3ga, An3gada and
<>others were the ministers of Sugri1va.
<NI>The monkeys who went to the south in search of Si1ta1,
<>reached the sea shore. The question was how to jump
<>over the sea to Lan3ka1. Each of them came forward to
<>show his ability and admitted failure. Finally Ja1mbava1n
<>called Hanu1ma1n to him and advised him to jump over
<>to Lan3ka1. Hanu1ma1n who was not aware of his own
<>powers,
<F>2) For the cause of his forgetting his own powers see under Trn2abindu II.</F> refused. Ja1mbava1n told him about his birth,
<>self-power, attainment of boons etc. Hanu1ma1n became
<>convinced of his powers at the words of Ja1mbava1n and
<>jumped over the sea to Lan3ka1. (Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Ja1mbava1n and the incarnation of Va1mana.%} Ja1mbava1n
<>walked round Maha1vis2n2u, who incarnated as Va1mana
<>to curb the powers of Maha1bali. At that time
<>Ja1mbava1n was immensely strong. But by the time of
<>the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma his strength had decreased
<>much. Hear what he said to the monkeys who as-
<>sembled on the sea shore to go in search of Si1ta1.
<NI>“My abilities in olden times were not what you see
<>now. In the far old days, I had walked round that [Page342-a+ 65]
<>Eternal Being Vis2n2u when he measured three steps at
<>the sacrifice of Maha1bali. Now, I am very old and
<>have not enough strength to jump over the sea.”
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 ka1n2d2a, Sarga 65).
<NI>4) {%Ja1mbava1n and the incarnation of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} The long-
<>living Ja1mbava1n who had witnessed nine out of the
<>ten incarnations of Maha1vis2n2u is seen in connection
<>with the precious stone Syamantaka, in the incarnation
<>of Kr2s2n2a. The Sun-god gave this jewel Syamantaka to
<>King Satra1jit. His younger brother Prasena wore it
<>and went to the forest for hunting. A lion killed him
<>and took the jewel in his mouth and was going along
<>the forest when Ja1mbava1n killed it and took the jewel.
<>It was rumoured that Sri1 Kr2s2n2a had killed Prasena
<>and taken the jewel. So S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went in search of
<>the jewel to the forest, defeated Ja1mbava1n and took the
<>jewel, and returned it to Satra1jit. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a married
<>Ja1mbavati1 the daughter of Ja1mbava1n. (Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10).
<NI>5) {%Ja1mbava1n became old for ever.%} At the time of the
<>incarnation of Va1mana, Ja1mbava1n was very strong
<>and valiant. When Va1mana brought under control the
<>three worlds by measuring three steps Ja1mbava1n
<>travelled throughout the three worlds carrying the news
<>everywhere. Within three moments Ja1mbava1n
<>travelled eighteen times through the three worlds. In
<>this travel of lightning-speed the end of the nail of his
<>toe touched the highest peak of Maha1meru, who
<>considered it as an insult and said “You are arrogant
<>of your speed and youth. Hereafter your body will
<>not reach where your mind reaches and you shall be
<>ever old.” Because of this curse Ja1mbava1n became old
<>and unable to carry out what he wished. (Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>JA1MBAVATI1. Daughter of the famous Ja1mbava1n. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a went in search of the famous precious stone
<>Syamantaka which was lost when Prasena wore it and
<>went to the forest for hunting. Kr2s2n2a found it in the
<>cave of Ja1mbava1n, who fought with him and was
<>defeated. Finally he gave his daughter Ja1mbavati1 to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a as wife, and the jewel Syamantaka as dowry.
<NI>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to his capital Dva1raka1 with his wife
<>Ja1mbavati1. When sons were born to the other wives
<>of Kr2s2n2a she became sad and requested her husband
<>that sons may be born to her also. On hearing this
<>request Kr2s2n2a went to the mountain where the
<>hermit Upamanyu was engaged in penance. With that
<>hermit who was an ardent devotee of S4iva, as his

<>accordance with his (Upamanyu's) advice. The
<>penance, holding yogadan2d2a and Kapa1la (devotee's

<>month penance was performed standing on one leg and
<>drinking only water. In the third month he did
<>penance standing on toes only and using air as food.
<>After six months Paramas4iva appeared and blessed
<>him that his wives would have ten sons each. Accor-
<>dingly Ja1mbavati1 gave birth to her first son who was
<>named Sa1mba. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>JAMBHA. A Daitya (Asura). He was the chief among
<>those who snatched away Amr2ta from the hands of
<>Dhanvantari. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 3).
<NI>In the Pura1n2as several Asuras (demons) bear-
<>ing the name Jambha are mentioned. It is stated in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha, Chapter [Page342-b+ 65]
<>38, that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed an Asura named Jambha.
<>Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 98, Stanza 49 that the teacher S4ukra refused
<>to help a Jambha whom Indra killed later. It occurs
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 102, Stanza
<>24, that Maha1vis2n2u had killed an asura called Jambha.
<>It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 285,
<>Stanza 2, that a group of Jambha1suras, who had
<>undergone training under Ra1van2a, once attacked
<>Hanu1ma1n. Another Jambha1sura had been killed by
<>Arjuna, as stated in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 49. All these Da1navas (Asuras) were sons of
<>Kas4yapa born of his wife Danu.
<HI>JAMBHAKA. A Ks2atriya King. This King was killed
<>in battle by S4ri1 Krs2n2a. He had a son who, later
<>became King but was killed by Sahadeva in his
<>conquest of the countries. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>31, Stanza 7).
<HI>JAMBU1. A tree which stands on the southern side of
<>the mount Maha1meru. This tree bears fruits and
<>flowers throughout the year irrespective of the seasons.
<>This tree is watered by the Siddhaca1ran2as. The
<>branches of this tree reach the realm of heaven. The
<>place in which this tree stands is known as Jambu1-
<>dvi1pa. The ripe fruits as big as elephants fall down and
<>are broken. The juice oozing from them flows as a big
<>stream. This is called the river Jambu1. It flows through
<>the southern part of the country known as Ila1vr2tta.
<>The goddess who lives on the bank of this big river is
<>known as Jambva1dini1. She is very fond of Jambu1 fruit.
<>This goddess who loves everything in the world, is
<>worshipped by the gods, na1gas (snakes), the hermits and
<>sages, Ra1ks2asas (giants) and every body in the world
<>with devotion. Even by the mere thinking of her she
<>could be pleased. She destroys the sins and increases
<>the purity of people. She cures all the diseases and
<>gives people, health, wealth, long life, prosperity and
<>happiness.
<NI>The juice of the Jambu1 fruit when mixed with soil and
<>acted upon by water, air and sun's rays, turns into a
<>kind of gold called Ja1mbu1nada. The devas, Vidya1-
<>dharas etc. use this gold to make ornaments for their
<>women. This gold is superior to other kinds of gold.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>JAMBU1DVI1PA. One of the Pura1n2ically famous
<>Saptadvi1pas (seven continents). These seven continents
<>are embankments separating the seven seas. Jambu1-
<>dvi1pa, Kraun5cadvi1pa, S4a1kadvi1pa and Pus2karadvi1pa are
<>included in the seven islands.
<NI>Jambu1dvi1pa has an area of one lakh of yojanas. The
<>island is round like a lotus flower. There are eight
<>long mountain ranges which divide the island into
<>nine countries, which look like nine petals of the lotus
<>flower. Each of these nine countries has an area of nine
<>thousand yojanas. The two countries of the north and
<>south extremities are bowshaped. Four of the remain-
<>ing seven are longer than the rest. The central country
<>is square. This country is known as lla1vr2tta, at the
<>centre of which there is the mountain Sumeru with
<>a height of one lakh of yojanas. This is called
<>Svarn2aparvata (The mountain of gold). The top of
<>this mountain is a great flat place with an area of
<>thirtythousand yojanas. This great plain is ten thousand
<>yojanas above the ground level. On the northern part
<>of Ila1vr2tta lie the three mountain ranges of Ni1lagiri, [Page343-a+ 65]
<>S4vetagiri and S4r2n3gava1n, and midway between them
<>the three countries called Ramyaka, Hiran2maya and
<>Kuru. On the southern part of lla1vr2tta, there are the
<>three mountains of Nis2adha, Hemaku1t2a and Hima1laya
<>and three countries Harivars2a, Kimpurus2a and
<>Bha1rata. The mountain Ma1lyava1n lies to the west and
<>Gandhama1dana to the east of lla1vr2tta. There are two
<>countries Ketuma1la and Bhadra1s4va having an area of
<>two thousand yojanas each with the two mountains
<>Ni1la and Nis2adha as boundaries. At the foot of the
<>mount Maha1meru, there are the mountains of
<>Mandara, Meru, Supa1rs4vaka, Kumuda and many
<>others. On those mountains big trees like n5a1val
<>(syzygium jambolanum) Ma1kanda (Mango tree)
<>Kat2ambu (Naucka Candamba) banyan etc. grow in
<>plenty. On the top of these mountains there are four
<>lakes, full of milk, honey, juice of sugarcane and sweet
<>water. The devas become prosperous by the touch of
<>the water of these lakes. Besides these parks there are
<>four heavenly parks known as Nandana, Caitraratha,
<>Vaibhra1ja and Sarvabhadraka. The women folk of the
<>devas (gods) and Gandharvas (demi-gods) play in
<>these parks, which are convenient for couples to carry
<>on lustful play. A river is formed there, by the juice
<>oozing from the fallen mango fruits. The river is
<>purple coloured and is called Arun2a1nadi1 (river Arun2a1).
<>The goddess named Arun2a1 lives here. The famous
<>Jambu1 tree is in this Jambu1dvi1pa. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 8).
<HI>JAMBU1KA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 74).
<HI>JAMBUKA. (JAMBUMA1LIKA). A S4u1dra Sage. The
<>child of a brahmin died when S4ri1 Ra1ma, after his twelve
<>years’ exile in forest had returned to Ayodhya1 and was
<>ruling the country in an ideal manner. The brahmin
<>and his wife carried the dead body of their child to the
<>palace with loud lamentations. Everybody felt surprised
<>how there could be child-death in the land when the
<>King was ruling it in the most dha1rmic (righteous)
<>manner. Then did Na1rada, who was present in the
<>assembly, point out that in a corner of Ra1mara1jya a
<>S4u1dra Sage was doing tapas and that it was the reason
<>for the untimely death of the brahmin child. At once
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma set out in search of the S4u1dra Sage after
<>directing S4atrughna to see that no enemy entered the
<>country, and asking Laks2man2a to take care of the dead
<>body of the brahmin child. After a rather detailed
<>search S4ri1 Ra1ma found Jambuka at the mountain called
<>S4ailam doing tapas hanging from the branch of a tree
<>on his legs with head down. He told S4ri1 Ra1ma that he
<>was the S4u1dra Sage called Jambuka and was performing
<>tapas thus so that he might ascend to heaven in his very
<>body. S4ri1 Ra1ma at once cut off the head of the S4u1dra
<>Sage, who attained, as soon as Ra1ma's sword fell on him,
<>moks2a (salvation), and the dead child of the brahmin
<>returned to life again. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>JAMBUKES4VARA. Name of an idol of S4iva (Lin3ga)
<>installed in Mysore. The S4ivalin3ga installed in the Jam-
<>bukes4vara temple in Mysore. Jambu1 is a fruit tree.
<>There is a story about how S4iva happened to come
<>under this tree.
<NI>Once upon a time this place was full of Jambu1 trees,
<>and a recluse performing a penance under a Jambu1
<>tree got a fruit of it. Attracted, so to say, by the sanctity
<>of the fruit the recluse submitted it first as an offering [Page343-b+ 64]
<>to Lord S4iva, and only after that he ate it. As a result of
<>that the fruit germinated in the stomach of the sage
<>grew up into a tree and emerged into light and air
<>bursting his head open. Elated at this the sage danced
<>before God, who asked him to return to the place from
<>where he got the fruit. Accordingly he returned to
<>Tiruva1nakovil and continued his penance. Pleased so
<>much with the Sage S4iva followed him and sat under
<>the tree. From that day onwards S4iva came to be
<>called Jambuna1tha. To this day Jambuna1tha sits under
<>the Jambu1 tree.
<NI>Later, a temple came to be built there under the follow-
<>ing circumstances. A controversy arose between Ma1l-
<>yava1n and Pus2padanta, two of the Bhu1tagan2as of S4iva,
<>as to who cherished more devotion to the Lord. The
<>controversy developed into a quarrel and Pus2padanta
<>cursed Ma1lyava1n into a spider, and Ma1lyava1n cursed
<>Pus2padanta into an elephant. Now, when the mutual
<>curse took effect wisdom dawned on both Ma1lyava1n and
<>Pus2padanta, and they took refuge in the Lord for re-
<>demption from the curse. The Lord sent both of them to
<>the Cola country, and after wandering about in differ-
<>ent parts of the country both of them came to Jambu-
<>kes4vara, and lived there worshipping God. The elephant
<>used to bathe daily in sacred ti1rthas, bring holy water
<>in its trunk and make an offering of it to the Lord. As
<>for the spider it wove a net above the head of the Lord.
<>so that dried leaves did not fall on it. The elephant
<>used to daily sweep off the net above the head of the
<>Lord and make his offering of the water thereon. But,
<>the spider would again weave the net. Thus their quar-
<>rel continued. One day the spider, in great anger, got
<>into the trunk of the elephant and bit it hard. Due to
<>unbearable pain it smashed its trunk on a granite stone
<>and fell down dead. At this God appeared and blessed
<>both of them. The Lord also said that the sacred spot
<>would come to be known as Tiruva1na-Kovil (a1na=
<>elephant; Kovil = temple) in memory of Pus2padanta
<>who had taken the form of the elephant. The spider
<>was told that he would be born in the Cola dynasty
<>and carry on for long years many good acts. Accor-
<>dingly Ma1lyava1n was born as the son of S4ubhadeva, the
<>Cola king and Kamala1vati1, his queen, and ruled the
<>land for many years under the name King Cen3kan2n2a.
<>He it was who built the Jambukes4vara temple. (Tiru-
<>va1nakka1vu Pura1n2a).

<>boons. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 219).
<NI>(2) None of the 100 a1ca1ryas in his court could answer
<>his questions about salvation satisfactorily. But, Pan5ca-

<>Chapter 211).
<HI>JANAKA.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Janaka was descended from Vis2n2u in the
<>following order:--Brahma1,--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Vivas-

<>Hrasvaroman--Si1radhvaja (Janaka).
<NI>2) {%Janaka dynasty.%} Dan2d2a, Vikuks2i and Nimi were the
<>three prominent sons of Iks2va1ku. The dynasty of Viku-
<>ks2i earned reputation as the cradle of such powerful
<>Kings as Vikuks2i, Kratha, Ma1ndhata1. Tris4an3ku. Haris4-
<>candra, Sagara and Bhagi1ratha. S4ri1 Ra1ma also was
<>born in Vikuks2i's dynasty. It was Nimi, the younger
<>brother of Vikuks2i who founded the Videha dynasty.
<>There is a story about that dynasty getting the name,
<>Videha. Nimi decided to conduct a yajn5a and requested
<>Vasis2t2ha to act as high priest at the yajn5a. Vas2is2t2ha,
<>who then was busy with the affairs of another yajn5a
<>asked Nimi to postpone his proposed yajn5a to a later
<>date. To this Nimi made no answer, and Vasis2t2ha went
<>away under the impression that his suggestion had been
<>accepted by Nimi. Accordingly, as soon as he got free
<>from other preoccupations Vasis2t2ha went to Nimi to
<>conduct his yajn5a. But, Nimi had already performed
<>the Yajn5a with Gautama as high priest. Enraged at this
<>Vasis2t2ha cursed Nimi that he should lose his body and
<>become Videha (without body). As the result of the
<>curse Nimi fell down dead. As Nimi had no sons living
<>the R2s2is churned out of his body a child. As the child
<>was got by mathana (churning) he was named Mithi
<>Janaka. After that all kings born in Mithi's dynasty
<>began using the common name Janaka.
<NI>The actual name of Janaka, father of Si1ta1, was S4i1ra-
<>dhvaja. Mithila1 or Mithila1puri1 was the city founded by
<>Mithi. From the time of the curse pronounced on Nimi
<>the Kings of that dynasty also came to be known as
<>Videhas, and the country they ruled Videha. (See
<>Nimi). (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 6th Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Brother of Si1radhvaja.%} Si1radhvaja, the father of Si1ta1
<>had a brother called Kus4adhvaja. While S4i1radhvaja
<>was the King of Mithila1 the King of Sa1m3ka1s4ya called
<>Sudhanvan attacked Mithila1. Si1radhvaja killed Sudhan- [Page344-b+ 65]
<>van in the war and crowned his brother Kus4adhvaja as
<>the King of Sa1m3ka1s4ya. Laks2man2a's wife U1rmila1 was
<>Kus4adhvaja's daughter. Kus4adhvaja had three daugh-
<>ters called Ma1n2d2avi1, U1rmila1 and S4rutaki1rti. Bharata
<>married Ma1n2d2avi1 and S4atrughna married S4rutaki1rti.

<NI>4) {%Birth of Si1ta1%} At a time when Si1radhvaja had no
<>issues a girl emerged from the furrows of the ploughed
<>earth, and Si1radhvaja felt the desire to bring up the
<>child as his own daughter. And, a celestial voice, “Oh!
<>Si1radhvaja! it is your own daughter” clinched the issue
<>for the King. That daughter was Si1ta1. Si1radhvaja--
<>Janaka--accordingly brought up Si1ta1 as his own dau-
<>ghter. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Cantol 18).

<NI>7) {%Janaka and As2t2a1vakra. See%} under As2t2a1vakra.
<NI>8) {%Janaka in Yamaloka.%} King Janaka once, by his yogic
<>powers cast off his physical body. A vima1na (aerial
<>chariot) from Devaloka arrived to carry Janaka's soul
<>there. On his way to Devaloka Janaka approached
<>Ka1lapuri1 where innumerable sinners were being tortur-
<>ed in the various hells. When they breathed the air
<>which had come in contact with Janaka's body, they
<>got much relief from their tortures and the fire of hell
<>now became cool and pleasing to them. When Janaka
<>was about to go away the inmates of hell begged him not
<>to leave them in that condition. He thought to himself
<>thus: “If these beings get some comfort or happiness
<>from my presence I shall surely stay here in Ka1lapuri1,
<>which will be my svarga (heaven).” Thinking thus,
<>Janaka the most righteous of souls stopped there.
<NI>And then Ka1la arrived there to determine suitable
<>punishments to the various kinds of sinners, and seeing
<>Janaka there, asked why he, the most virtuous and the
<>purest of souls, waited there, Janaka explained his reason
<>for standing there and added that he would quit the
<>place only if Ka1la released all those people from hell.
<>On hearing Janaka's answer Ka1la pointed out to him one
<>by one the sinners who were being tortured in hell
<>and explained things as follows:--“Look here, that
<>fellow there had seduced the wife of his most intimate
<>friend, and that is why he is tied to a red hot iron bar
<>for 10,000 years. After those 10,000 years he would be
<>born in a pig's womb, and when he is born among
<>human beings it would be as a eunuch. The other fellow
<>there forcibly kissed another man's wife, and so he has
<>to be roasted in Raurava hell for hundred years. That
<>other fellow is put into this vessel filled with blood and
<>pus with both his hands cut off as he had stolen other
<>people's property. This fellow did not speak even a
<>word of welcome to a tired and hungry man who sought
<>his hospitality at night. That is why he has been thrown
<>into thick darkness, and there, for a hundred years, he
<>must undergo the additional suffering of wasp-bite. As
<>for this man he had in a loud voice found fault with
<>another man, and this other fellow is his friend who
<>listened to those vilifications attentively. And, that is
<>the reason why both of them have been pushed into
<>this unused well. So, all these people have to suffer for
<>their sins. You, King Janaka, who did only righteous
<>acts will please go away from this accursed place.”
<NI>Janaka asked Ka1la how those sinners could be released
<>from hell, and Ka1la answered that if any good act of [Page345-a+ 64]
<>the King was transferred to them they could be set
<>free. One early morning Janaka had, with a pure
<>heart, chanted “Ra1ma, Ra1ma” and that good act was
<>exchanged for the freedom of the sinners.
<NI>After their release had been effected, Janaka asked
<>Ka1la: “You say that only sinners come here. What sin
<>have I committed that I should come here?” Ka1la's
<>reply to the question was as follows:--“Oh! King,
<>no one else in the whole world has so much pun2ya as
<>you have got. But, a small sin you have committed.
<>Once you prevented a cow from eating grass, and,
<>therefore, you had to come up to the gates of hell. Now,
<>that sin has been atoned for. So you may go to svarga.”
<>Janaka saluted Ka1la and in the divine vima1na went to
<>Heaven. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapters 30 and 31).
<NI>9) {%Artificial Janaka.%} While Si1ta1 was a captive in Lan3ka1
<>Ra1van2a, to bring her round, deputed a very clever
<>magician called Marutta to her, disguised as Janaka,
<>her father. And Marutta, in the capacity of her father
<>consoled her and advised her to yield to the wishes of
<>Ra1van2a. But Si1ta1 did not yield, and the artificial Janaka
<>assumed his original form of Marutta and went away.

<NI>2) {%Birth, marriage and accession to throne.%} Janamejaya
<>was the son of Pari1ks2it by his wife Madravati1. Vapu-
<>s2t2ama1, daughter of Suvarn2avarman, King of Ka1s4i1 was
<>Janamejaya's wife. Two sons, S4ata1ni1ka and S4an3ku-
<>karn2a were born to them. Janamejaya had three
<>brothers called S4rutasena, Ugrasena and Bhi1masena.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 2nd Skandha; A1di Parva, Chapters
<>3 and 95).
<NI>3) {%Death of his father.%} Janamejaya's father, Pari1ks2it
<>ruled the country in a very distinguished manner for
<>sixty years. While once hunting in the forest Pari1ks2it
<>became very tired and thirsty. While searching for
<>water he came across a Sage named S4ami1ka and asked
<>him for some water. S4ami1ka being engaged in medita-
<>tion did not hear the King's request. But, the [Page346-a+ 65]
<>King mistaking the sage's silence for haughtiness threw
<>in anger a dead snake round his neck and went away.
<>But, within seven days of the incident Pari1ks2it was
<>bitten to death by Taks2aka, king of the Na1gas accord-
<>ing to the curse pronounced on him by Gavija1ta,
<>son of sage S4ami1ka.
<NI>Janamejaya was only an infant at the time of his
<>father's death. So the obsequies of the late king were
<>performed by his ministers. After that at an auspicious
<>time Janamejaya was crowned King. Within a short
<>time he mastered statecraft. Dhanurvidya1 was taught
<>by Kr2pa1ca1rya. Very soon he earned reputation as an
<>efficient administrator. He got married in due course.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 2nd Skandha).
<NI>4) {%His hatred towards snakes.%} In the course of a talk
<>one day with Janamejaya Uttan3ka the sage detailed to
<>him the circumstances of his father's death. Only
<>then did he understand the actual cause of Pari1ks2it's
<>death, and the information kindled in him intense
<>feelings of revenge not only against serpents but also
<>against the whole serpent dynasty. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>2nd Skandha).
<NI>5) {%Sarpasatra. (Serpent yajn5a).%} Janamejaya sought
<>the advice of priests and R2tviks as to how best revenge
<>could be taken against the serpents, and they advised
<>him to perform the great Yajn5a called Sarpasatra.
<>And, accordingly all necessary arrangements for the
<>Satra were made, and the King began di1ks2a1 (Initiation)
<>for it (to live for a few days under severe routine to
<>prepare the author of the yajn5a for it). But the priest
<>who made the arrangements looked into signs about the
<>successful conclusion of the yajn5a and opined that it
<>would be obstructed by a brahmin, and, the King,
<>therefore, ordered strict steps to be taken against the
<>entry of strangers into the Ya1gas4a1la1.
<NI>And, the Sarpasatra began. High priests wore black
<>clothes, and chanting mantras they made offerings in
<>the sacred fire, and this created a burning sensation in
<>the hearts of serpents. They began, one after another
<>to come and fall into the fire. All varieties of serpents
<>got consumed by the fire thus.
<NI>Sages like Uttan3ka, Can2d2abha1rgava, S4a1rn3garava, Vya1sa,
<>Udda1laka, A1treya, Pramataka, S4vetaketu, Na1rada,
<>Devala, Ka1laghat2a, S4rutas4ravas, Kohala, Devas4arman,
<>Maudgalya and Samasaurabha acted as R2tviks at the
<>Satra. Though almost all the serpents courted death in
<>the fire, Taks2aka alone did not come. Fear-stricken he
<>had taken refuge with Indra.
<NI>As the chanting of mantras increased in intensity and
<>volume Va1suki began to feel the burning sensation. He
<>requested his sister Jaratka1ru to find out some means
<>of escape from the Satra, and at the instance of Jarat-
<>ka1ru her son A1sti1ka set out for the palace of Janame-
<>jaya to obstruct the Yajn5a.
<NI>Though the R2tviks invoked for a long time Taks2aka did
<>not appear. Enraged at his absence, Uttan3ka searched
<>for Taks2aka with his divine eyes and found him seated
<>on the throne of Indra along with him, who had given
<>him (Taks2aka) asylum. This challenge of Indra kindled
<>the wrath of Uttan3ka all the more, and he invoked
<>Indra, Taks2aka and Indra's throne too so that all of
<>them might together come and fall into the fire. And,
<>lo! there came the whole lot of them. Only two minutes
<>more and all of them would be reduced to ashes.
<NI>By now A1sti1ka, the son of Jaratka1ru had arrived at the [Page346-b+ 64]
<>Yajn5a s4a1la1. Janamejaya received the young Sage with
<>all respect and promised to grant his desire what-
<>ever that be. A1sti1ka's demand was that the Sarpa Satra
<>should be stopped. Though Janamejaya was not for
<>stopping the yajn5a, he was reminded of his promise to
<>grant any desire of A1sti1ka and the latter insisted on the
<>stopping of the Satra. Janamejaya stopped it. A1sti1ka
<>blessed that the serpents which had died at the Satra
<>would attain salvation. (A1di Parva, Chapters 52-58;
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, 2nd Skandha).
<NI>6) {%Listens to the Bha1rata story.%} While the Sarpa S4atra
<>was being conducted Vya1sa came over there and related
<>the whole story of the Maha1bha1rata at the request of
<>Janamejaya. (A1di Parva, Chapter 60).
<NI>7) {%Sarama1's curse.%} Janamejaya along with his brother
<>once performed a yajn5a of long duration at Kuruks2etra.
<>While the yajn5a was going on, a dog (son of Sarama1
<>the bitch of the Devas) came there. The three brothers
<>of Janamejaya beat the dog which returned to its
<>mother, Sarama1, crying. The mother asked him whe-
<>ther he had done anything to deserve the beathing, and
<>he answered thus: “No, mother, I had done nothing
<>wrong. I did not lick the havis, nor did I even look at
<>it.” Hearing her son's reply Sarama1 in deep anguish,
<>went to Kuruks2etra and questioned Janamejaya as to
<>why her innocent son was beaten by his brothers. Nei-
<>ther he nor his brothers replied to Sarama1, and she
<>cursed Janamejaya that he would be subjected to
<>adr2s2t2aphala (unforeseen results). This curse upset
<>Janamejaya so much that after the Sarpa Satra was
<>over and on his return to Hastina1pura he made a search
<>for a Purohita (priest) competent enough to redeem
<>him from his sins, and at last he invited Somas4ravas,
<>son of the great sage S4rutas4ravas to be his Purohita, and
<>thus did Somas4ravas become the priest of Janamejaya
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>8) {%Successors of Janamejaya.%} Janamejaya had two sons,
<>Candra1pi1d2a and Surya1pi1d2a by his wife Ka1s4ya1. Hundred
<>sons, experts in archery, were born to Candra1pi1d2a. The
<>eldest of them, Satyakarn2a, ruled the country after Jana-
<>mejaya. Satyakarn2a had a son called S4vetakarn2a to
<>whom was born a son called Ajapa1rs4va by his wife
<>Ya1davi1, the daughter of Suca1ru. (Bhavis2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 1).
<NI>9) {%Other Information%}
<NI>(1) Janamejaya defeated the King of Taks2as4ila1 and sub-
<>jugated the country. A1di Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 20).
<NI>(2) The Sage called Veda was the preceptor of Jana-
<>mejaya. (A1di Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 82).
<NI>(3) After the Sarpa Satra, Janamejaya performed an
<>As4vamedha yajn5a at which Vya1sa delivered a lengthy
<>discourse on life and salvation. As Janamejaya said
<>that if he were to believe the words of Vya1sa his dead
<>father Pari1ks2it should be shown to him. Vya1sa brought
<>Pari1ks2it down from Svarga and showed him to his son.
<>On the occasion were also present sage S4ami1ka and
<>his son S4r2n3gi1. (A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 35)
<NI>10) {%Life time of Janamejaya.%} The great war at Kuru-
<>ks2etra was fought in 3138 B.C. (See under Maha1bha1rata)
<>After the war was over the Pa1n2d2avas ruled the country
<>for 36 years. Vya1sa took three years to compose the
<>Maha1bha1rata. According to the Maha1prastha1nika Parva
<>the Pa1n2d2avas set out for the forest after handing over
<>the government to Pari1ks2it, who ruled the country for [Page347-a+ 65]
<>sixty years. From the above facts it becomes evident
<>that Janamejaya became king in 3042 B.C.

<>been forsaken by his subjects. So he had to take to
<>the forest. His search for means to get rid of the sin
<>took him at last to sage Indrota, who made him per-
<>form As4vamedha yajn5a. Thus, he got redemption from
<>the sin and he became Indrota's disciple also. (S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapters 150-153).
<HI>JANAMEJAYA VI. A son of King Kuru by his wife,

<HI>JANA1RDANA II. See under D2ibaka.
<HI>JANASTHA1NA. This is a part of the forest Dan2d2aka, which

<>tried to attract S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, and her nose
<>etc, were cut off, in this forest. It was in this place
<>that S4ri1 Ra1ma cut off the head of a Ra1ks2asa (demon)
<>and threw it away. That head fell in the lap of a hermit
<>called Mahodara. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 39).

<>It is mentioned in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 278, that he
<>was the son of the King Somaka and father of the King
<>Vr2s2atanu.
<NI>2) {%Jantu born again.%} Somaka had hundred wives. But
<>only one of them gave birth to a child. That child was
<>Jantu. He was a pet of all the hundred wives. Once
<>Jantu was bitten by an ant. All the hundred queens
<>began crying and shouting and all ran to him. Hearing
<>the tumult in the women's apartment of the palace,
<>the King and the minister ran to that place. When
<>the tumult was over the King began to think. “It is
<>better to have no sons at all, than to have only one
<>son. There are hundred queens. But none of them
<>bears a child. Is there a solution for this?”
<NI>At last the King summoned his family-priests and
<>consulted them. The decision of the priests was that
<>if the King should sacrifice his only son, then all his
<>wives would become pregnant and all would give
<>birth to children, and that among the sons thus born,
<>Jantu also would be reborn. The mother of Jantu did
<>not look at this project with favour. “How can we be
<>sure that Jantu also will be there among the sons to be
<>born, after his death?” She was worried by this
<>thought. The priests consoled her and said that there
<>will be a golden mole on the left flank of Jantu.
<>Finally the mother agreed to their plan. Sacrificial
<>dais was arranged. Sacrificial fire for holy offerings was
<>prepared. The priests tore the child into pieces and
<>offered them as oblation in the fire. When the sacrifice
<>was finished, all the hundred queens became pregnant.
<>Each of them gave birth to a child. As the priests had
<>predicted, there was a golden mole on the left flank
<>of the child delivered by the mother of Jantu. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapters 127 and 128).
<HI>JA1NUJAN3GHA. A King who is fit to be remembered
<>every morning and evening. Mention is made about
<>this King in Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>165, Stanza 69. [Page348-a+ 65]
<HI>JAPA(S). A group of Gods (devas) of the third
<>Manvantara (age of Manu). In that Manvantara the
<>Manu was Uttama, Indra was Sus4a1nti, and the
<>Devagan2as (groups of gods) were Sudharmas, Satyas,
<>Japas, Pratardanas, and Vas4avartins, the five groups,
<>each consisting of twelve members. (See under
<>Manvantara).
<HI>JA1PAKA. A Bra1hman2a who was constantly engaged in
<>uttering Ga1yatri1. Ja1paka was ordered to go to hell
<>because certain mistakes were detected in the uttering
<>of Ga1yatri1. But Devi1 Sa1vitri1 intervened. She appeared
<>before him and gave him heaven. This Ja1paka was a
<>contemporary of Iks2va1ku. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, 3
<>Chapters from 197).
<HI>JARA. A forester. It was this forester who shot an
<>arrow at S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and killed him mistaking him for
<>an animal. (See under S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a).
<HI>JARA1. A harpy (Ra1ks2asi1). Though she was a harpy
<>she loved human beings. It is believed that if the
<>picture of Jara1 and her children is placed in the
<>house and venerated, there will be no haunting of any
<>other kinds of demons.
<NI>The figure of Jara1 was sculptured on the wall of the
<>Palace of Br2hadratha, the King of Magadha, and was
<>being worshipped. Because the King worshipped her,
<>she had been looking forward to an opportunity to
<>reward the King. Br2hadratha had married two
<>daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1. They were twin sisters.
<>For a long time they remained childless. The King
<>was very sorry, and went to the forest with his wives.
<>He saw the hermit Kaks2i1va1n or Can2d2akaus4ika, the son
<>of Gautama and requested that a son should be born
<>to him. The hermit was sitting in meditation under a
<>mango tree and a mango fell on his lap. The hermit
<>took it and by prayer and meditation he invoked
<>divine power into it and gave it to the King. The King
<>divided it into two and gave it to his wives. The queens
<>became pregnant and the three returned joyously.
<NI>In due course both delivered. But each of them gave
<>birth to only half of a child. The horrified queens took
<>the uncouth figures outside the palace and left them
<>there. Jara1 was watching this. She ran to the spot
<>and placed the two portions together. Instantly it
<>became a child of proper form. Hearing the cry of the
<>child the mothers came out. Jara1 appeared there and
<>placed the child before the King Br2hadratha. As desired
<>by Jara1 the child was named Jara1sandha because he
<>was joined together by Jara1. This child grew up and
<>became the notorious King Jara1sandha of Magadha.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, 3 Chapters from 17).
<NI>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>182, Stanza 12 that when Arjuna fought with Jara1-
<>sandha this harpy had been staying in the weapon of
<>Jara1sandha and was killed in that fight.
<HI>JARATKA1RU I. A hermit who is Pura1n2ically famous.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} This hermit was born in a Bra1hman2a dy-
<>nasty known as Ya1ya1varas. He was the only son of
<>Ya1ya1varas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 13).
<NI>2) {%The name Jaratka1ru.%} The meaning of the name
<>Jaratka1ru is given in Bha1s2a1bha1rata, A1di1 Parva, Chapter
<>40, as follows:--
<NI>“Jara1 is consumption, Ka1ru is da1run2a (awful). By and
<>by his body became hard and awful and by penance
<>he made his body to wear out, and so he got the name
<>‘Jaratka1ru’.” [Page348-b+ 65]
<>By means of penance he made his body lean and worn
<>out and so got the name Jaratka1ru.
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} The calm and abstemious Jaratka1ru
<>remained unmarried for a long time. One day he
<>happened to meet with his Manes. They were holding
<>on to a grass and were about to fall into hell, and a
<>rat was cutting the root of the grass which was their
<>only hold. The moment the root is severed all the
<>Manes would fall into the deep ravine of hell. It was
<>at this juncture that Jaratka1ru, met his Manes. The
<>moment they saw him they said, “See Jaratka1ru, we
<>are your Manes. We have to obtain, heaven, life, con-
<>tentment and happiness by the good deeds of your
<>son. So go and get married quickly.”
<NI>At first he did not like the talk about marriage. Still,
<>in order to procure heaven for his ancestors he agreed
<>to get married. But he made a condition that the name
<>of the bride also should be Jaratka1ru and she should
<>be given to him as alms. Saying these words, he
<>walked away along the forest.
<NI>News reached the ears of Va1suki, the King of the
<>Na1gas (serpents) that the hermit Jaratka1ru was
<>wandering through the forests calling out that somebody
<>should give him as alms a damsel named Jaratka1ru.
<>Va1suki had a sister. Jaratka1ru was her name. Va1suki
<>decided to give her to the hermit Jaratka1ru. She was
<>adorned with costly garments and ornaments and was
<>taken to the hermit Jaratka1ru. Jaratka1ru said:--
<NI>“Hear my condition, I will not cherish her if she
<>causes displeasure to me. If she does so I will send
<>her away instantly.”
<NI>On condition that if she did anything displeasing to
<>him he would leave her at once, the hermit Jaratka1ru
<>married Jaratka1ru the sister of Va1suki. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 2; Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapters 13 and 47).
<NI>4) {%Leaves his wife.%} Jaratka1ru lived in the hermitage
<>with her husband looking after him with love and
<>loyalty. One day the hermit was sleeping with his head
<>on the lap of his wife. Though it was sunset the hermit
<>slept on. It was time for the evening worship
<>of the hermit. If he is aroused he will get angry. The
<>wife was in a difficult situation. Anyhow she aroused
<>her husband. The hermit got up full of anger and
<>shouted, “You have hindered my sleep, you wicked
<>woman and teased me. So from today you are not my
<>wife. I am going away.”
<NI>She begged him for pardon with tears. But without
<>paying any heed to the entreaties of his pregnant wife,
<>he left her.
<NI>The helpless Jaratka1ru gave birth to a son named
<>A1sti1ka who later stopped the famous sacrifice, Sarpa
<>Satra meant for killing the serpents. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 47). See under Jaratka1ru II.
<HI>JARATKA1RU II.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} It occurs in Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9, about Jaratka1ru, the sister of Va1suki and
<>the wife of hermit Jaratka1ru as follows. This devi1
<>(goddess) is the daughter of Praja1pati Kas4yapa, born
<>from his mind. So she got the name Manasa1devi1
<>(goddess born from mind). Some think that she got
<>the name Manasa1devi1 because she is the deity of mind.
<>There are some who imagine that she got the name
<>Manasa1devi1 because she held S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Parama1tman
<>(the Supreme Spirit) firmly in her mind. This devi1 [Page349-a+ 65]
<>had been meditating upon S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Parama1tma1 for
<>three yugas (world-ages) She is known by twelve
<>names.
<NI>(1) {%Jaratka1ru.%} Manasa1devi1 had been performing
<>penance, and meditating upon S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Parama1tman
<>for three complete yugas and her garments and body
<>were worn out. So Kr2s2n2a gave her the name Jaratka1ru.
<NI>(2) {%Jagadgauri1.%} Because she was comely and beautiful
<>and of fair complexion and was worshipped all over
<>the world, she got the name Jagadgauri1.
<NI>(3) {%Manasa1.%} Because she was born from the mind of
<>Kas4yapa, the name “Manasa1” was given to her.
<NI>(4) {%Siddhayogini1.%} As the fruits of her Tapas (penance),
<>she got the attainments of Yoga (meditation, devotion,
<>contemplation and other ways of union with the
<>Universal Soul) and so she was given the name Siddha-
<>yogini1.
<NI>(5) {%Vais2n2avi1.%} Because she had constant devotion to
<>Maha1vis2n2u she was called Vais2n2avi1.
<NI>(6) {%Na1gabhagini1.%} Because she was the sister of Va1suki
<>the King of the Na1gas, she got the name Na1gabhagini1.
<>(Sister of Na1ga).
<NI>(7) {%S4aivi1.%} As she was a disciple of S4iva she got the
<>name S4aivi1.
<NI>(8) {%Na1ges4vari.%} Because she saved the Na1gas (serpents)

<NI>(12) {%Maha1jn5a1navati1.%} Since she had the attainments of
<>vast knowledge, yoga and the power of bringing the
<>dead to life, she was given the name Maha1jn5a1navati1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Once the serpents became a plague to the
<>men of the earth and they all went to Praja1pati
<>Kas4yapa and made their complaints. Kas4yapa and
<>Brahma1 consulted each other and at the instruction of
<>Brahma1 Kas4yapa created several Mantras (spells and
<>incantations) and Manasa1devi1 from his mind as the
<>deity of these spells.
<NI>3) {%Power of her tapas (penance).%} When she was very
<>young she went to Kaila1sa and performed penance to
<>Paramas4iva for a thousand years. At last S4iva appeared
<>before her and gave her the divine knowledge, and
<>taught her the Sa1maveda. He gave her the divine S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a mantra (a spell) called ‘As2t2a1ks2ari1’ and the
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Kavaca (the armour of Kr2s2n2a) called
<>Trailokyaman3gala’ and taught her how to use them in
<>worship. Wearing this armour and using the spell she
<>performed penance in Pus2kara, meditating upon S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a Parama1tma1, for three yugas (world ages). At
<>the end of this period S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Parama1tma1 appeared
<>before her and gave her all the boons she wanted. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a said that all over the world she would be worshipp-
<>ed and that she had power to give boons to her
<>worshippers.
<NI>4) {%Marriage and rejection.%} Kas4yapa gave his daughter
<>Manasa1devi1 in marriage to Jaratka1ru, a hermit. As they
<>were living in the hermitage, once the hermit slept
<>with his head on the lap of his wife. Seeing the setting
<>sun she aroused her husband. The hermit became [Page349-b+ 65]
<>angry and decided to reject her. She thought of the
<>Devas, who instantly arrived. Brahma1 argued that it
<>was not meet and right to reject his wife before a
<>child was born to her. The hermit touched the groin of
<>his wife and prayed and with the power of yoga (medi-
<>tation, contemplation etc.) she became pregnant. The
<>son born to her is the famous hermit A1sti1ka.
<NI>After giving birth to A1sti1ka she went to Kaila1sa, where
<>Parames4vara and Pa1rvati1 received her.
<NI>5) {%The mantra (incantation) of worship.%} To get the
<>attainment of Manasa1devi1 one has to utter the spell
<>(mantra) “Om3 Hri1m3-S4ri1m-Kli1m3-Aim3-Manasa1devyai
<>sva1ha1” five lakh times. He who has got the attainment
<>of this mantra as given above will be equal to Dhan-
<>vantari (the physician of the Gods) and to him poison
<>will be Amr2ta (ambrosia). This goddess could be
<>invoked into a secluded room on the day of San3kra1nti
<>(Transit of the Sun). If offerings of oblations and
<>worship are carried on, he would be blessed with
<>children, wealth and fame.
<HI>JARA1SANDHA I. A terrible King of Magadha.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following

<>Cyavana-Kr2ti-Vasu-Br2hadratha-Jara1sandha.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Jara1sandha was created by joining together
<>two halves of a child, by a giantess called Jara1, and so
<>this child got the name Jara1sandha. (For detailed story
<>see under Jara1).
<NI>3) {%The first battle with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Asti and Pra1pti, the
<>two wives of Kam3sa, were daughters of Jara1sandha.
<>When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Kam3sa, the two daughters
<>went to their father and shed tears before him. Jara1-
<>sandha became angry and with a mighty army sur-
<>rounded the city of Mathura1. A fierce battle was
<>fought between Jara1sandha and Kr2s2n2a. At last Bala-
<>bhadrara1ma caught hold of Jara1sandha and was
<>about to kill him, when an ethereal voice said that
<>Balabhadrara1ma was not the person to kill Jara1sandha.
<>Accordingly Ra1ma and Kr2s2n2a set Jara1sandha free.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>4) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) It is mentioned in Bha1gavata, Skandha 10, that

<NI>(2) Jara1sandha had four sons, Soma, Sahadeva, Tu1rya
<>and Sruta1s4ru of whom Sahadeva became King of
<>Magadha, after the death of Jara1sandha.
<NI>(3) Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 185, that Jara1sandha had been present at the
<>Svayam3vara (marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>(4) Once there arose a battle between Jara1sandha
<>and Kar2n2a, in which Jara1sandha was defeated and so
<>he made a treaty with Karn2a. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanza 6).
<NI>5) {%The death of Jara1sandha.%} The enmity between S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and Jara1sandha was life-long. These two mighty
<>powers confronted each other eighteen times. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>decided to kill Jara1sandha, the King of Magadha,
<>in a duel. Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a with Arjuna and Bhi1ma,
<>reached the city of Magadha in the guise of Bra1h-
<>man2as. They started from the kingdom of Kuru [Page350-a+ 64]
<>travelled through Kuruja1n3gala and passed by
<>Padmasaras and Ka1laku1t2a, visited the holy. places of
<>Gan2d2aki1, Maha1s4on2a1, Sada1ni1ra1 and such others, crossed
<>the river Sarayu1 and reached the opposite bank. Then
<>they travelled through the countries of East Kosala
<>and Mithila1. Touring through the countries they
<>crossed the rivers Carman2vati1, Gan3ga1 and S4on2a. Wear-
<>ing matted hair and barks of trees they reached Giri-
<>vraja, the capital city of Magadha. There were three
<>big drums, which were used only on special occasions.
<>The hide of elephant was used for making them.
<F>1. See under Br2hadratha IV to know about the sound of this big drum.</F> Seeing
<>all these sights they reached the presence of Jara1sandha,
<>who welcomed them with necessary formalities and
<>talked with them. But they kept silence. At last S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a told him that his two friends were having the
<>vow of silence, which would terminate only at mid-
<>night. So the King left them in the sacrificial hall and
<>went to the palace. He came to them at midnight and
<>asked them who they were. S4ri1 Kr2s2ha revealed to him
<>that they were Kr2s2n2a, Bhi1ma and Arjuna, who had
<>come to fight a duel with Jara1sandha, who had unrea-
<>sonably put many innocent Kings in dungeon, and
<>challenged him to select any one of them for duel. Jara1-
<>sandha, trembling with fury, selected Bhi1ma. In that
<>duel Jara1sandha was killed. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>3 Chapters from 20).
<NI>6) {%Names given to Jara1sandha.%} Ba1rhadratha, Ma1gadha,
<>Magadha1dhipa and Jara1putra are some of the names
<>used in the Maha1bha1rata by Vya1sa as synonyms of
<>Jara1sandha.
<HI>JARA1SANDHA II. (S4atrusaha). One of the hundred

<HI>JA1TAKARMA1DISAM3SKA1RA(S). In the ancient days
<>the people of Bha1rata observed certain social and
<>customary rites immediately after the birth of a child.
<>They were known as Ja1takarmans. Each caste had its
<>own ja1takarmans. They are given below:
<NI>If it is a male child ja1takarman should be done before
<>cutting the umbilical cord. At that time gold is to be
<>rubbed in ghee and honey and the tongue of the child
<>should be touched with it, uttering mantras (spells)
<>(Colloquial name of this rite is giving gold and honey).
<>The child should be named on the tenth or twelfth day
<>after birth, selecting suitable lunar day, good star and
<>auspicious moment. The name should imply prosperity
<>to Bra1hmans, might to Ks2atriyas, wealth to Vais4yas
<>and humility to S4u1dras. That is, the word ‘S4arman’
<>in the case of Bra1hman2a, ‘Varman’ for Ks2atriyas,
<>‘Gupta’ for Vais4yas and ‘Da1sa’ for S4u1dras, should be
<>added to the name. The names given to girls should
<>be of easy utterance, having clear meaning but not
<>cruel, very beautiful, charming, and propitious
<>avoiding long letters as far as possible. Four months
<>after delivery, the child should be taken out of the
<>room of confinement to see the Sun. On the sixth
<>month the rite of ‘Annapra1s4a’ (feeding with rice)
<>should be performed. In accordance with hereditary
<>customs the two rites mentioned above may be per-
<>formed at any time after the third month. For
<>Bra1hman2as and Ks2atriyas the ceremony of ‘Caula’
<>(tonsure) may be performed at the time of birth or at
<>the age of three. The ceremony of Upanayana (Investi-
<>ture with the Bra1hma string) should be conducted at
<>the age of eight from pregnancy for Bra1hman2as, at the
<>age of eleven from pregnancy for Ks2atriyas and at the
<>age of twelve for Vais4yas. But Upanayana could be
<>performed at the age of five for Bra1hman2as who desire
<>Bra1hma-radiance, at the age of six for Ks2atriyas who
<>desire might and at the age of eight for Vais4yas who
<>desire wealth. There is another opinion that Upana-
<>yana could be performed up to the age of sixteen for
<>Bra1hman2as and twentytwo for Ks2atriyas. Even after
<>the attainment of this age, if this ceremony is not
<>performed, that boy will be considered an out-cast from
<>the mantra (spell) of Ga1yatri1, and will have no
<>admittance to the rituals and ceremonies performed by
<>Bra1hman2as and will be known by the name Vra1tya
<>(an outcast, uninvested Bra1hman2a). These Vra1tyas
<>could not be taught Vedas or be given women as
<>wives.
<NI>Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya and Vais4ya brahmaca1ris (celibates)
<>could use the hides of black antelope, spotted deer or
<>goat as upper garment and clothes made of silk thread,
<>flax or wool of sheep or red leopard. To tie round the
<>waist, Bra1hman2as have to make belts out of Mun5ja
<>(grass), Ks2atriyas, out of Mu1rva (grass) and Vais4yas
<>out of flax. When these are not available, Bra1hman2as
<>may use Kus4a grass, Ks2atriyas n5a1nal grass and Vais4yas
<>Darbha grass called balbaja to make belts of customary
<>three darns or five darns with a knot. A celibate should
<>have a stick. For Bra1hman2as the stick should be made
<>of Bilva (Aegle marmelos) or “pala1s4a” (butea frondosa)
<>and for Ks2atriyas, of banyan or blackwood. (Mimosa
<>catechu) and for Vais4yas, of Dillenia speciosa (Uka
<>tree) or fig tree. For Bra1hman2as the stick should [Page351-a+ 65]
<>reach up to the top of the head, for Ks2atriyas up to the
<>forehead and for Vais4yas up to the nose. Before going
<>for alms, the celibate should take his stick, bow before
<>the sun, go round the fire and only then set out. The
<>alms received should be offered to the teacher as
<>oblation, then he should turn to the east and wash hands
<>and mouth and eat it. Bra1hman2as should wear
<>the upper garment or their sacred thread (Yajn5a-
<>su1tra) on the left shoulder and under the right arm and
<>then it is called ‘Upavi1ta’; if it is on the right shoulder
<>and under the left arm it is called “Pra1ci1na1vi1ta” and
<>if it is round the neck it is called “Nivi1ta”.
<NI>These Ja1takarmans may be done for the female child
<>also at the stipulated times by tantras, without reciting
<>mantras, for the purification of the body. The rituals
<>performed without reciting Vedamantras (spells) are
<>called tantras. For women marriage is to be considered
<>as Upanayana, looking after the needs of husband to be
<>considered as learning at the house of the teacher, and
<>housekeeping as samida1dha1na (gathering fuel of Butea
<>frondosa). (Manusmr2ti, Chapter 2).

<>as and when he got an opportunity for it. One day
<>taking advantage of Arjuna's absence Bhi1ma was
<>out ahunting) Jat2a1sura caught hold of the others as
<>also the arrows and ran away with them. Sahadeva
<>alone managed to slip away from his clutches. Dharma-
<>putra pledged his word that Jat2a1sura would be killed
<>before the sunset. Hearing all the hubbub (Bhi1ma
<>hurried to the scene, killed the Asura and saved his
<>brothers and Pa1n5ca1li1 from difficulties and danger.
<>(Vana Parva, Chapter 157).
<HI>JAT2A1SURA III. This Jat2a1sura had a son called Alam-

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u as follows,
<>Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Arun2a--Jat2a1yu.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Two sons called Sampa1ti and Jat2a1yu were

<>as Maha1s4veta1.
<NI>3) {%Jat2a1yu flies towards Su1rya.%} Sampa1ti and Jat2a1yu,
<>once under a bet flew up towards the sun. Jat2a1yu
<>outflew Sampa1ti, and in the exuberance of youth
<>entered Su1rya's orbit at noon time with the result that,
<>due to the excessive heat his wings were scorched. At
<>this Sampa1ti, to save his brother, flew up higher than
<>Jat2a1yu and spread out his wings like an umbrella over
<>Jat2a1yu with the result that Sampa1ti's wings were burnt,
<>and he fell down somewhere on the Vindhya mountains.
<>He spent the rest of his life under the protection of a
<>sage called Nis4a1kara who was performing penance on
<>the mountains. After their tragic meeting in Su1rya-
<>man2d2ala Sampa1ti and Jat2a1yu never again met in their
<>life. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Chapter
<>58; Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Fought with Ra1van2a.%} Jat2a1yu clashed with Ra1van2a,
<>who was carrying away Si1ta1devi1 in his vima1na, and in
<>the fierce fight that they fought in the air, Ra1van2a cut
<>off Jat2a1yu's wings and thus felled him on the earth,
<>almost dead. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a,

<HI>JA1TISMARAKI1T2A. A worm which got emancipation
<>through the advice of Vya1sa. Once while Vya1sa was
<>roaming about in the country, by chance he saw this
<>worm. It was running through the road, seeing a cart
<>coming very fast. Vya1sa stopped it and asked, “What
<>are you running from?” The worm replied that he
<>was running in fear that the wheel of the cart coming
<>from behind might crush him. In the previous birth
<>this worm was a S4u1dra. Jealousy, resentment, arrogance,
<>selfishness etc. were the traits of his character in his
<>previous life. Only twice in his life had he done good [Page352-a+ 65]
<>deeds. Once he honoured his mother and on another
<>occasion he respected a Bra1hman2a. Because of these
<>two good deeds, in his present life as worm he had
<>the remembrance of his previous life. Vya1sa gave the
<>worm necessary advice. Instantly the worm was crushed
<>under the wheel of the cart.

<>Parva, Chapter 149, Stanza 67).
<HI>JAYA XI. (JAYAVIJAYAS). They were gate-keepers of
<>Vaikun2t2ha. As these two sons of devas were engaged
<>in the service of Maha1vis2n2u guarding the gate, the
<>hermits Sanaka and others came to see Maha1vis2n2u to
<>pay him homage. Jaya and Vijaya stopped them at the
<>gate. Sanaka got angry and cursed them to take three
<>births on the earth as Asuras (demons). The sorrow-
<>ful Jaya and Vijaya requested for absolution from the
<>curse. The hermit said that they had to take three
<>births as Asuras and that they would be redeemed by the
<>weapon of Maha1vis2n2u. Accordingly Jaya and Vijaya
<>were born in the earth as Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2yaka-
<>s4ipu. They were killed by Maha1vis2n2u. In the second
<>birth they were Ra1van2a and Kum3bhakarn2a. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u incarnated as S4ri1 Ra1ma killed them. In the third
<>birth they were S4is4upa1la and Dantavaktra. They were
<>killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, an incarnation of Bhagava1n Vis2n2u.
<>For further details see under Hiran2ya1ks2a. Hiran2yaka-
<>s4ipu, Ra1van2a; Kum3bhakarn2a, S4is4upa1la and Dantavak-
<>tra. After three births Jaya and Vijaya returned to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<HI>JAYA XII. Father of the Ra1ks2asa (giant) Vira1dha, who
<>was killed by S4ri1 Ra1ma at the forest Dan2d2aka. Vira1-
<>dha was born to the giant Jaya by his wife S4atahrada1.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 3).
<HI>JAYA XIII. The original name of the Maha1bha1rata writ-
<>ten by Vya1sa, Many of the scholars are of opinion that
<>Vya1sa was not the author of the whole of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata that we see in its present form now. They say
<>that the Bha1rata written by Vya1sa consisted only of
<>eight thousand and eight hundred stanzas. That work was
<>named Jaya. To those eight thousand and eight hund-
<>red stanzas Vais4ampa1yana added fifteen thousand, two
<>hundred stanzas and this great book was given the
<>name Bha1rata or Bha1rata sam3hita1 (Bha1rata collection).
<>When Su1ta recited this book to other hermits in Naimi-
<>s4a1ran2ya the book had a lakh of stanzas. Henceforward
<>the book was called Maha1bha1rata, (History of classical
<>Sanskrit Literature; Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>62, Stanza 20).
<HI>JAYA1. I. A daughter of the hermit Gautama. Gautama
<>had two daughters by his wife Ahalya1 named Jayanti1
<>and Apara1jita1 besides Jaya1. While Daks2a was perform-
<>ing a ya1ga, (sacrifice) this Jaya1 informed Pa1rvati1 of
<>it. Pa1rvati1 fell down when she heard that Daks2a had
<>not invited S4iva to the sacrifice. S4iva got angry at
<>Daks2a's negligence and from his wrath the Bhu1tagan2as
<>such as Vi1rabhadra and others (attendants of S4iva)
<>arose. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 4).
<HI>JAYA1. II. Wife of Pus2padanta, a gan2a (attendant of
<>S4iva). See under Pus2padanta.
<HI>JAYA1. III. Another name of Pa1rvati1. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 6, Stanza 16).
<HI>JAYA1 IV. A daughter of Daks2a. Two daughters named
<>Jaya1 and Suprabha1 were born to Daks2a. To Suprabha1
<>and Jaya1 fifty sons each were born. These hundred sons [Page353-a+ 64]
<>wore various kinds of arrows and such other weapons.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 21).
<HI>JAYA1 V. A maid of Pa1rvati1. It is seen in Skanda Pura1n2a
<>that this Jaya1 was the daughter of Praja1pati Kr2s4a1s4va.
<HI>JA1YA1. Wife. The husband enters the wife in the form of
<>semen and takes birth as the foetus and then is born
<>from her as son and so the wife is called Ja1ya1.

<HI>JAYADEVA I. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 13th cen-
<>tury A.D. He is the author of the play ‘Prasannara1gha-
<>vam’. As far as the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma is concerned,
<>some changes have been made in this play from that
<>given by Bhavabhu1ti in his ‘Maha1vi1racarita’. Accord-
<>ing to this play S4ri1 Ra1ma and Ba1n2a1sura both were
<>lovers of Si1ta1. The famous work ‘Candra1loka’, a trea-
<>tise on rhetorical figures, was written by this poet Jaya-
<>deva. His most important work is ‘Gi1tagovinda’, the
<>theme of which is the early life of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, especially
<>the love between S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Ra1dha1, which is very
<>touchingly described. This book consists of 12 sargas
<>and each sarga contains 24 octaves. This poet was a
<>devotee of Kr2s2n2a. He used to sing lyrics before the
<>image of Kr2s2n2a while his wife danced according to the
<>beat.
<HI>JAYADEVA II. See under Dus4s4a1sana II.
<HI>JAYADHVAJA. The fifth of the hundred sons of Ka1rta-

<>ks2atra was the only famous and mighty emperor. Really speaking Jayadratha was the grandson of Br2hatks2atra. The statement that Jayad-
<>ratha was the son of Br2hatks2atra only means that he was a descendant of that king.</F>
<NI>2) {%Birth and attainment of Boon.%} Jayadratha was born as
<>a result of severe fasts and vows taken by his father.
<>There was an ethereal voice at the birth of Jayadratha,
<>“This child would become a very famous King.
<>The head of him, who puts down the head of this child
<>on the earth would break into a hundred pieces within a
<>moment” His father was filled with joy when he heard
<>this ethereal voice, and so he made Jayadratha King at [Page353-b+ 62]
<>a very young age and went to Samantapan5caka to per-
<>form penance. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 146).
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 116, Stanza 17, that Jayadratha married
<>the princess Duss4ala1.
<NI>4) {%Jayadratha and Pa1n5ca1li1.%} From the very beginning
<>Jayadratha was a bitter enemy of the Pa1n2d2avas. It is
<>not difficult to find out the root of this enmity. It is
<>stated in A1di Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 21 that Jayad-
<>ratha was present at the svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1. The
<>fact that he did not get Pa1n5ca1li1, might have laid the
<>foundation of this enmity.
<NI>From this moment Jayadratha was looking forward to a
<>chance to carry off Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>The forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas began. They wandered
<>through many forests and finally reached the forest,
<>Ka1myaka. Once the Pa1n2d2avas left Pa1n5ca1li1 alone in the
<>hut and went to the forest for hunting. Jayadratha
<>came to know of this. He came with his men to the
<>place where the hut stood. At the very first sight of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1, he fell in love with her. He sent Kot2ika1sya,
<>the King of Trigarta, who was the son of Suratha as a
<>messenger to Pa1n5ca1li1. Kot2ika1sya told Pa1n5ca1li1 about the
<>superior qualities of Jayadratha and requested her to
<>accept Jayadratha, leaving the Pa1n2d2avas. But she
<>rejected his request. The messenger returned to Jayad-
<>ratha and told him what had happened. Jayadratha
<>himself came in a chariot and tried to entice her.
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 did not yield. Jayadratha caught her by force
<>and took her away in his chariot. Dhaumya the priest
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas followed them with tears. Shortly after-
<>wards, the Pa1n2d2avas returned to the hut. They searched
<>for Pa1n5ca1li1 here and there. They heard everything
<>from a maid, and instantly followed Jayadratha, whose
<>army confronted the Pa1n2d2avas. The heads of almost all
<>the warriors of Jayadratha fell on the ground. Jayad-
<>ratha fled from the battlefield. The Pa1n2d2avas followed
<>him and caught him and scourged him. Bhi1ma shaved
<>his head letting only five hairs to stand on the head.
<>They took him as a prisoner before Dharmaputra.
<>Finally at the instruction of Yudhis2t2hira and Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>he was released. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 264 to
<>272).
<NI>5) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) In the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya (imperial consecration)
<>performed by Yudhis2t2hira, Jayadratha took part as a
<>tributary King. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34,
<>Stanza 8).
<NI>(2) Jayadratha was present at the game of dice between
<>Duryodhana and Yudhis2t2hira. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>58, Stanza 28).
<NI>(3) It was while going to Sa1lva to marry a damsel that
<>Jayadratha attacked Pa1n5ca1li1 at the forest of Ka1myaka.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 264).
<NI>(4) Feeling ashamed at the result of his attempt to
<>carry off Pa1n5ca1li1, Jayadratha went direct to Gan3ga1-
<>dva1ra and pleased S4iva by penance. S4iva gave him the
<>boon that he would be able to defeat all the Pa1n2d2avas
<>except Arjuna. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 272).
<NI>6) {%Jayadratha in the battle of Bha1rata.%}
<>In the battle of Bha1rata, which lasted for eighteen days
<>between the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas, Jayadratha [Page354-a+ 65]
<>took the side of the Kauravas and fought against the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. The part played by him in the battle is given
<>below:--
<NI>On the first day there was a combat between Jayad-
<>ratha and Drupada. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter
<>45, Stanzas 55 to 57).
<NI>(2) Attacked Bhi1masena. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chap-

<>to 12).
<NI>(8) He began to combat with Arjuna. (M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter, 145).
<NI>7) {%The death of Jayadratha.%} When a fierce fight began
<>between Arjuna and Jayadratha, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to
<>Arjuna and said, “Arjuna, there was an ethereal voice
<>at the birth of Jayadratha. The head of the person who
<>puts down the head of Jayadratha on the earth, would
<>be broken into a hundred pieces. So send an arrow in
<>such a way that his head falls on the lap of his father.”
<>Hearing this, Arjuna sent an arrow which cut off the
<>head of Jayadratha and the head fell in the lap of Jayad-
<>ratha's father who had been sitting in deep penance
<>and meditation in Samantapan5caka. Instantly the father
<>awoke from meditation and stood up and the head of
<>his beloved son, with ear-rings on both ears fell on the
<>earth and the head of the father was broken into a
<>hundred pieces and he died. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>146, Stanzas 104 to 130).

<HI>JAYA1NI1KA II. A brother of the King of Vira1t2a. (M.B.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 158, Stanza 42).
<HI>JAYANTA I. Son of Indra.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order: Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Indra--Jayanta.
<>Jayanta was the son born to Indra by his wife S4aci1-
<>devi1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 112, Stanzas 3 and 4).
<NI>2) {%Jayanta lost one eye.%} During his forest life, S4ri1 Ra1ma [Page354-b+ 65]
<>lived with Si1ta1 and Laks2man2a on the mountain Citra-
<>ku1t2a for some days. Once S4ri1 Ra1ma, being very tired
<>of walking in the forest fell asleep with his head in the
<>lap of Si1ta1. Taking this chance Jayanta came in the
<>shape of a crow and scratched the breast of Si1ta1 with
<>his claws. Si1ta1 cried and S4ri1 Ra1ma woke up and saw
<>Jayanta in the shape of a crow. Ra1ma got angry and
<>shot the Brahma1stra (a divine arrow) against Jayanta.
<>Fear of life made him fly throughout the whole of the
<>three worlds. Even Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara
<>were unable to protect him, All the while the divine
<>arrow followed him. Finally having no go he came and
<>fell at the feet of S4ri1 Ra1ma. S4ri1 Ra1ma said that the
<>Brahma1stra could never become futile and so the arrow
<>must hit his right eye. Accordingly the arrow struck at
<>his right eye and thus Jayanta lost his right eye. In
<>Adhya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a this story is stated with some
<>slight changes. According to Adhya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>this incident took place when Si1ta1 had been drying raw
<>flesh. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 38).
<NI>3) {%Jayanta hidden in the ocean.%} After getting the boons
<>Ra1van2a became arrogant and with a big army went to
<>the realm of the gods. Ra1van2a engaged Indra in a
<>fierce battle. In that fight Meghana1da the son of
<>Ra1van2a attacked Jayanta, who swooned and fell down.
<>Immediately Puloma1, the father of S4aci1devi1, gathered
<>Jayanta in his hands unseen by anybody and hid him
<>in the sea. After the disappearance of Jayanta the battle
<>entered the second stage. Thinking that his son Jayanta
<>had been killed, Indra began to fight with Ra1van2a
<>with more vigour than before. In the battle which
<>followed Meghana1da subdued Indra and made him a
<>captive. Taking Indra and the celestial maids as
<>captives, Ra1van2a and his men went to Lan3ka1. (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%Jayanta became Bamboo.%} Once Agastya came to
<>Indra's durbar. Indra arranged for the dance of
<>Urvas4i1 in honour of Agastya's visit. In the midst of
<>the dance Urvas4i1 saw Jayanta before her and she fell
<>in love with him. Consequently her steps went out of
<>beat. Na1rada who was playing his lute called Mahati1
<>went wrong. Agastya got angry and cursed Jayanta
<>and changed him to a bamboo. Urvas4i1 was cursed to
<>become a woman with the name Ma1dhavi1. Agastya
<>cursed Na1rada that his lute Mahati1 would become the
<>lute of the people of the world. (Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) In the stealing of the Pa1rija1tapus2pa (the flower of

<>bathe in this ti1rtha would obtain the fruits of the
<>sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya. (Imperial consecration).
<HI>JAYANTI1 II. Daughter of Indra and sister of Jayanta.
<>In Bha1gavata, Skandha 4, there is a story stating
<>how Jayanti1 was the wife of S4ukra for ten years.
<NI>S4ukra1ca1rya was the teacher-priest of the Asuras
<>(demons). Once the devas (gods) had completely de-
<>feated the Asuras. With the intention of procuring
<>new powers from S4ri1 Parames4vara, S4ukra1ca1rya went to
<>Kaila1sa. When the penance of S4ukra became more
<>and more severe the gods and Indra began to be
<>flurried. Indra told his daughter Jayanti1 to become the
<>servant of S4ukra and to break his penance somehow or
<>other. Jayanti1 did not like this procedure of her father.
<>Still she did not like to disobey her father. So she
<>went to Kaila1sa and became the attendant of S4ukra
<>and stayed with him. She served him dutifully and
<>with chastity. She would fan him with plantain leaf.
<>She would prepare cold and fragrant water for him
<>to drink. When the Sun became hotter she would hold
<>her upper garment as an umbrella so that he should
<>be in the shade. She would gather fully ripened good
<>fruits for him to eat. She would gather good variety
<>of darbha grass, cut them into the length of a span and
<>with good flowers she would give them to the hermit
<>for his morning oblations. She would gather soft
<>sprouts and make bed for him and would stand near
<>him fanning till he slept. She would get water ready
<>for him to rinse his mouth when he woke up. Thus she
<>did the work of a dutiful disciple. She did not, in any
<>way by speech or action, try to entice him so that his
<>vow of penance might be broken. She spoke only words
<>which would be pleasing and helpful to him. This
<>continued for thousand years and then Paramas4iva
<>appeared before him and gave the boons he requested
<>for. After that S4ukra1ca1rya talked with her. In accor-
<>dance with her request the hermit S4ukra allowed her to
<>live with him for ten years as his wife. He gave her a
<>boon that during that period of ten years they both
<>would be invisible to the world. Thus S4ukra1ca1rya
<>married Jayanti1 and they lived in the house very happily
<>for ten years.
<HI>JAYANTI1 III. The queen of the King R2s2abha who was
<>born in the dynasty of King Agni1dhra. Hundred
<>children were born to R2s2abha of Jayanti1 (See under
<>R2s2abha II).
<HI>JAYAPRIYA1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 12).
<HI>JAYARA1TA. A warrior who fought on the side of the
<>Kauravas. Bhi1masena killed this warrior, who was a
<>prince of Kalin3ga, in the battle of Bha1rata. (M.B.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 155, Stanza 28).
<HI>JAYARATHA. A Sanskrit poet who lived in Ka1s4mi1ra in
<>the 12th century. He was a S4aivite. His important work
<>is Haracaritacinta1man2i’. (History of classical Sanskrit
<>literature). [Page355-b+ 65]
<HI>JAYAS4ARMAN. A Bra1hman2a who became wealthy by
<>taking the vow of Kamala1 (Kamala1vrata). Kamala1 is
<>the eleventh day of ‘Adhima1sa’.
<NI>It is believed that this day is better than other days. If
<>a man fasts on that day Goddess Kamala1 will be pleased
<>with him.
<NI>The devotee should awake in the Bra1hma muhu1rta
<>(fortyeight minutes before sunrise) and take bath
<>thinking of Purus2ottama and begin the fast. If the
<>prayer and meditation is conducted at the house he
<>will get double the fruits. If it is at a river it will
<>yield four times the fruits. If it is at a cow-shed the
<>fruits will be thousandfold and if it is conducted at
<>a fireshed or S4aivite temple, at a holy bath or in the
<>presence of God the fruits will be a thousand and one
<>hundredfold and if it is near a tulasi1 (holy basil) the
<>fruits will be a lakhfold and if it is done in the
<>presence of Vis2n2u the fruits obtained will be un-
<>limited.
<NI>This Jayas4arman who took the fast was the son of a
<>noble Bra1hman2a named S4ivas4arman of Avanti1. He was
<>the youngest of five sons. He became a wicked man. So
<>he was avoided by his relatives. Being driven away
<>from home, he went to a distant forest and lived there.
<>Once, by luck, he happened to reach the holy place of
<>Triven2i1 Maha1ti1rtha. He was very tired of hunger and
<>thirst. So he bathed in the ti1rtha and searched for some
<>hermitage. By chance he saw the hermitage of Harimitra
<>As it was the month of Purus2ottama many people had
<>gathered there. Bra1hman2as were telling stories of miti-
<>gation of sins. He heard the story of the vow called
<>Kamala1vrata and its fruits. So Jayas4arman stayed in that
<>hermitage with them and took the vow of Kamala1vrata.
<>That night Devi1 appeared before him and said: “I have
<>come from Vaikun2t2ha, because I am greatly pleased with
<>you. Since you have taken the vow of Kamala1vrata on
<>the eleventh day of the dark lunar fortnight called
<>Kamala1 of the month of Purus2ottama I will grant you
<>boons. Because you have taken the vow at Triven2i1, I am
<>immensely pleased with you. The noble Bra1hman2as of
<>your future generations also will be blessed by me”.
<>Saying these words the Devi1 gave him boons and dis-

<>Pa1n2d2avas. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, A1di [Page356-a+ 63]
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 8, that Jayatsena was
<>present at the svayam3vara (marriage) of Draupadi1.
<>Towards the end of the battle of Bha1rata, the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas sent a letter of invitation to this King and accord-
<>ingly he came to the help of the Pa1n2d2avas with an aks2au-
<>hin2i1 of army (21870 Chariots, 21870 elephants, 65610

<>to be Jara1sandhas. But it is said that after the death of the famovs Jara1sandha his son Sahadeva became king. This Sahadeva, with his
<>brother Jayatsena took the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and fought against the Kauravas. Hence the King Jayatsena mentioned here must be the
<>son of some other Jara1sandha of the Kingdom of Magadha.</F>
<HI>JAYATSENA V. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 69, that this

<NI>When summer season began Pa1rvati1 told her husband
<>S4iva: “My Lord, Summer has set in. What are we to
<>do without a house to protect us from the hot sun and
<>the strong wind?” S4iva replied. “Dear! It is because
<>I have no house that I walk about in the forest
<>always.”
<NI>Because S4iva said so, the loyal wife Sati1devi1 spent the
<>summer with her husband in the shade of trees. When
<>the summer was over rainy season began. People stopp-
<>ed walking about. The sky became black with clouds.
<>The roaring sound of thunder was heard everywhere.
<>Seeing that the rainy season had begun Pa1rvati1 again
<>request her husband to erect a house. Hearing her
<>request S4iva replied. “I have no wealth at all to build
<>a house. You see that I am wearing the hide of a leo-
<>pard. The serpent S4es2a is my Bra1hma-string. Padma
<>and Pin3gala are my ear-rings. One of my bracelets for
<>the upper arm is Kambala and the other one is the
<>na1ga (serpent) Dhanan5jaya. My bracelet on the right
<>hand is As4vatara and on the left hand is Taks2aka. The
<>string that I wear round my waist is Ni1la, as black as
<>antimony. So let us go above the clouds and spend the
<>rainy season there. Then rain will not fall on your
<>body.”
<NI>Saying thus, S4iva got into a lofty cloud with Pa1rvati1
<>and sat there. That cloud looked like the flag of S4iva.
<>Thenceforward S4iva came to be known by the name
<>Ji1mu1taketu. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter).
<HI>JI1MU1TAKETU II. See under Ji1mu1tava1hana.
<HI>JI1MU1TAVA1HANA. A Vidya1dhara. (demi-god). He was
<>the son of Ji1mu1taketu, who was the ruler of a city
<>named Ka1n5canapura in a valley of the Hima1layas. Be-
<>ing childless he had been sad for a long time. At last
<>he approached the divine tree Kalpaka (a heavenly tree
<>that yields every wish) that stood in his garden and
<>requested it to bless him with a child. Thus a son was
<>born to him. The famous Ji1mu1tava1hana was that son.
<>When Ji1mu1tava1hana came to know of the divine powers
<>of the Kalpaka tree, from the ministers, with the per-
<>mission of his father he went to the Kalpaka tree,
<>bowed before it and said to it, “Oh noble tree! You have [Page357-a+ 65]
<>granted all the wishes of my forefathers. But I have one
<>wish. No body should be miserable in the world. So I
<>wish to give you to the world with that purpose in
<>view”. Instantly an ethereal voice said from the tree.
<>“If you are forsaking me I am going away. But I will
<>fulfil your wish.” Thus according to the wish of Ji1mu1-
<>tava1hana the Kalpaka tree shed gold everywhere in the
<>world and then went to heaven and disappeared. The
<>earth became wealthy and prosperous. The fame of
<>Ji1mu1tava1hana spread throughout the three worlds, and
<>all the Vidya1dharas grew jealous of him. As the heavenly
<>tree Kalpaka, which yielded all the wishes, had return-
<>ed to heaven, they thought it the most propitious time
<>and arrayed their army against Ji1mu1tava1hana. His
<>father Ji1mu1taketu had completed all preparations to
<>meet the enemy. But Ji1mu1tava1hana approached his
<>father and said, “Father ! I am perfectly sure that no
<>body could defeat you in battle. But see how mean
<>it is to destroy so many lives and win the country mere-
<>ly for the pleasures of this fragile body. So let us go
<>away from here. Leave the kingdom to them.”
<NI>Ji1mu1taketu, who was pleased at this generous nature
<>of his son, respected his wish and went with his family
<>to the Malaya mountain and lived there. Mitra1vasu,
<>the son of Vis4va1vasu, the King of the Siddhas and
<>Ji1mu1tava1hana became close friends. One day Ji1mu1ta-
<>va1hana was wandering about in the forest when he saw
<>in the middle of a garden a temple dedicated to Devi1
<>and a young woman of exquisite beauty, surrounded by
<>her maids, singing hymns and worshipping Devi1. Ji1mu1-
<>tava1hana was attracted by her extra-ordinary beauty.
<>Love budded in her heart also. On enquiry it was
<>understood that she was Malayavati1, the sister of Mit-
<>ra1vasu. After that both of them engaged in a little talk
<>of love-making. Hearing her mother calling, Malaya-
<>vati1 instantly went home. Being fallen head-long in
<>love, Ji1mu1tava1hana spent the night somehow or other
<>and at dawn reached the temple with a hermit boy.
<>While the hermit boy was consoling Ji1mu1tava1hana
<>Malayavati1 also came there. Ji1mu1tava1hana and his
<>friend hid behind a tree. She was alone, and since she
<>could not bear separation from her lover she decided
<>to commit suicide and standing at the steps, she said
<>“Devi ! If it is impossible to get that Ji1mu1tava1hana as
<>my husband in this birth, let it be so. But bless me that
<>I may have my wish granted in the next birth at least”.
<>Saying this she tied one end of her upper garment on
<>the tree and tried to commit suicide. Instantly there
<>was an ethereal voice which said, “Daughter, don't do
<>such rash things. Ji1mu1tava1hana will become your hus-
<>band. He will become the emperor of the Vidya1dharas
<>also.” Ji1mu1tava1hana-came and untied the knot of the
<>upper garment with his own hands and saved her from
<>death. Her maid appeared and said with delight.
<>“Friend! you are very lucky. Today I heard what prince
<>Mitra1vasu said to his father Vis4va1vasu. Thus he said
<>‘Father! Ji1mu1tava1hana who gave away his own Kal-
<>paka tree for the welfare of others has come to this place.
<>It will bring prosperity to us, if we show our hospitality
<>to this noble guest by giving our Malayavati1 to him. It
<>is very difficult to get such a noble man for my sister
<>anywhere else.” The father consented. The prince ins-
<>tantly went to the abode of this gentleman. I think the
<>marriage will take place today. So come, let us go
<>home.” [Page357-b+ 65]
<NI>With his heart overflowing with joy, Ji1mu1tava1hana
<>went to his house. Mitra1vasu was there. He revealed
<>the purpose of his coming. Ji1mu1tava1hana, who had the
<>remembrance of his previous births told Mitra1vasu that
<>in the previous birth also they had been friends and
<>that Malayavati1 had been his wife. Thus their marriage
<>took place. Delightful days of the married life passed
<>one by one. One day Ji1mu1tava1hana and Mitra1vasu
<>went for a walk. They reached a forest on the seashore.
<>Seeing some bones there Ji1mu1tava1hana asked Mitra1-
<>vasu about them. Mitra1vasu said: “In ancient days
<>Kadru1, the mother of Na1gas (serpents) made Vinata1,
<>the mother of Garud2a, her slave by some trick. Garud2a
<>liberated his mother from slavery. But the hatred
<>increased day by day and Garud2a began to eat serpents,
<>the children of Kadru1. Seeing this, Va1suki the King
<>of Na1gas entered into a contract with Garud2a, so as to
<>prevent the na1gas from being destroyed altogether. The
<>arrangement was that Va1suki would send a serpent
<>everyday to Garud2a. Garud2a ate all those serpents
<>sent by Va1suki in this place. These are the bones of
<>those poor snakes.”
<NI>When Ji1mu1tava1hana heard this story his heart was
<>filled with pity. He decided to save the life of at least
<>one serpent by giving his body instead. But the
<>presence of Mitra1vasu was an obstacle to carry out
<>his wish. At that particular moment a minister of
<>Vis4va1vasu appeared there and took away Mitra1vasu
<>saying that he was wanted by his father. Left alone,
<>Ji1mu1tava1hana stood there when he saw a young man
<>coming with an old woman who was crying bitterly.
<>On enquiry Jtmu1tava1hana learned that in accordance
<>with the agreement with Garud2a, the old woman was
<>bringing her only son S4an3khacu1d2a to give him as food
<>to Garud2a. Ji1mu1tava1hana told them that he would
<>take the place of S4an3khacu1d2a that day. The mother
<>and the son reluctantly agreed to his desire. The old
<>woman went away crying and S4an3khacu1d2a went to the
<>temple.
<NI>Hearing the sound of Garud2a's wings Ji1mu1tava1hana
<>laid himself on a stone and Garud2a taking him in his
<>beaks flew to the top of the Malaya Mountain. On the
<>way the jewel of Ji1mu1tava1hana known as ‘Cu1d2a1ratna’,
<>which was soaked in blood fell down, in front of
<>Malayavati1. Knowing that it was the jewel of her
<>husband, with a terrible cry she ran to her father.
<>Because of his knowledge of arts and sciences,
<>Ji1mu1taketu also knew everything and with his wife and
<>daughter he went to the top of the Malaya mountain.
<NI>In the meanwhile, S4an3khacu1d2a, having done obeisance
<>to ‘Gokarn2ana1tha’ (God), came back to the stone
<>where he had left Ji1mu1tava1hana and seeing a pool of
<>fresh blood, became sad and silent. Then determining
<>that he would save Ji1mu1tava1hana at any cost, he
<>went up the mountain following the track of the blood
<>drops.
<NI>Garud2a took Ji1mu1tava1hana to the peak of the mountain
<>and began to peck at him. Ji1mu1tava1hana grew more
<>and more delightful as the pecking became harder.
<>Garud2a looked at him with wonder and thought,
<>“Surely, this is not a na1ga. It must be a Gandharva or
<>somebody else.” Not knowing what to do he sat looking
<>at his prey, who invited him to finish off his meal. By
<>this time S4an3khacu1d2a had reached the spot. Soon
<>Ji1mu1taketu with his wife and Malayavati1 also arrived. [Page358-a+ 64]
<>They all cried aloud. Garud2a was in great confusion.
<>When he knew that he was about to eat the famous
<>Ji1mu1tava1hana, who had given away even the Kalpaka
<>tree for the good of others, Garud2a was filled with
<>remorse. Instantly Ji1mu1tava1hana died. The parents
<>and S4an3khacu1d2a cried beating their breasts. Malayavati1
<>fell on the ground and cried. Then looking up she
<>called out with tears. “Ha ! Devi ! Jagadambika1 ! you
<>have told me that my husband would become the
<>emperor of the Vidya1dharas. Has your boon become
<>futile because of my misfortune?” Devi1 appeared and
<>said “Daughter ! My words will not become futile.”
<>Then Devi1 sprinkled Amr2ta (ambrosia) on Ji1mu1ta-
<>va1hana and brought him to life. He sprang up more
<>radiant than before, and was anointed as emperor
<>of the Vidya1dharas by Devi1. When Devi1 disappeared
<>Garud2a who was much pleased, told Ji1mu1tava1hana
<>to ask for any boon.
<NI>Ji1mu1tava1hana requested for the boon that Garud2a
<>should stop eating the Na1gas and that all the serpents
<>who had been reduced to bones should be brought to
<>life again. Garud2a granted him that boon. All the
<>serpents which had been killed by Garud2a came to
<>life again. All the gods and hermits came there with
<>joy. After all had gone, Ji1mu1tava1hana went with his
<>relatives to the Hima1layas as the emperor of Vidya1-
<>dharas.
<F>1) This story is told to the king Trivikramasena by Veta1la. See under Trivikramasena.</F> (Katha1saritsa1gara, Sas4a1n3kavati1 Lambaka,
<>Taran3ga 23).
<HI>JI1RN2ODDHA1RA. Erection and consecration of images
<>fixed in temples which have fallen into dilapidation, is
<>called Ji1rn2oddha1ra. Mention is made in Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 67, about the principles of Ji1rn2oddha1ra, as
<>follows:
<NI>The priest should adorn the image with ornaments and
<>perform ‘Stavana’. If the idol is very badly ruined by
<>age it must be abandoned. Broken image and that
<>with any part of the body severed or disfigured should
<>also be abandoned, even if it is made of stone or any
<>other material. When the image is renovated the
<>priest should make burnt offerings thousand times with
<>Narasim3hamantra (spell or incantation). If the ruined
<>image is made of wood it should be burned. If it is
<>made of stone it should be placed at the bottom of
<>deep water, either in the sea or anywhere else. If it is
<>made of metals or jewels, it must be put into water.
<>The ruined image should be placed in a carriage and
<>covered with a cloth. With instrumental music and
<>so forth the image should be taken to water in a pro-
<>cession and then submerged in water. After this the
<>priest must be given a gift. Only after this should the
<>new image be erected and consecrated. On a good day
<>in an auspicious moment a new image of the same
<>material and measurement as of the old image should
<>be erected and consecrated by the priest.
<HI>JITA1RI. Son of Avi1ks2it born of the family of Pu1ru.
<>Avi1ks2it was the son of King Kuru. Mention is made
<>about Jita1ri in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 94,
<>S4tanza1 53.
<HI>JITA1TMA1. A Vis4vadeva (A class of gods) concerned
<>with S4ra1ddha (offerings to the Manes). (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 91, Stanza 31).
<HI>JITAVATI1. A daughter of King Us4i1nara. She was the
<>most beautiful woman in the world. She was the friend [Page358-b+ 64]
<>of the wife of a Vasu named Dyau. It was because of
<>the words of this Jitavati1 that the As2t2avasus (the eight
<>Vasus) stole the cow Nandini1 of Vasis2t2ha, and by the
<>curse of Vasis2t2ha had to take birth in the womb of
<>women on earth. (See under Gan3ga1, Para 7).
<HI>JIS2N2U I. A name of Arjuna. (See under Arjuna).
<HI>JIS2N2U II. A synonym of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. As S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a had
<>won all the battles he fought, he got the name Jis2n2u.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 70, Stanza 13).
<HI>JIS2N2U III. A warrior who fought on the side of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas against the Kauravas. This warrior who was
<>a native of Cedi, was killed by Karn2a (M.B. Karn2a

<>ya1. Nala who had been living there under the name
<>Ba1huka had accepted Ji1vala as his friend. (See under
<>Nala).
<HI>JI1VA1TMAN {%(The induvidual life or soul).%} The Apara-
<>brahman (which is next to the highest Brahman) that
<>is so minute and subtle is called Ji1va1tman. Parabrahman
<>is God almighty. It is mentioned in Taittiri1yopanis2ad
<>about this aparabrahman as follows :
<NI>“Tasma1d va1 etasma1da1tmana a1ka1s4ah2 sambhu1tah2,
<>a1ka1s4a1d va1yuh2 va1yoragnih2, agnera1pah2 adbhyah2 pr2thvi1

<NI>‘From this A1tman came into existence ether possessing the
<>quality of sound. From ether air, possessing the qualities
<>of sound and touch, came into existence. Fire with the
<>qualities of sound, touch and colour came into being
<>from air. From fire, water having the qualities of sound
<>touch, colour and taste came into being. From water earth
<>with the qualities of sound, touch, colour, taste and smell
<>came into existence. Vegetation grew from earth, and
<>from vegetation food, from food semen, and from semen
<>Purus2a came into existence. The materialized form of
<>aparabrahman is the body. Its subtle form is the soul.
<>Ji1va1tma1 or the individual soul is the subtle form of soul
<>dwelling in the materialized form of the aparabrahman.
<>This soul sits in the miniature lotus of heart in the
<>miniature either. The body which is made of the five
<>elements is the dwelling place of this Ji1va1tma1. The

<>originated from food is the outer covering of the Ji1va1t-
<>ma1. This materialized body is also called Annamaya-
<>kos4a (the cask of food). Inside this annamayakos4a there
<>is the Pra1n2amayakos4a (the chest of the life breaths). It is

<>of Vijn5a1namayakos4a that the Ji1va1tma1 feels its indivi-

<>ma1tma1 (the soul of the universe). As the shadow
<>pervades the body of a man this Ji1va1tma1 overshadows
<>this body.” S4ri1 S4an3kara1ca1rya expounds it in another
<>way; he says that the Ji1va1tma1 is tied to the body by
<>the imagination or desires of the mind.
<HI>JN5A1NAPA1VANATI1RTHA. An ancient holy bath. Men-
<>tion is made in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter,
<>84, Stanza 3 that those who visit this holy place will
<>attain the fruits of performing the sacrifice of Agni-
<>s2t2oma.
<HI>JR2MBHA1DEVI1. See under Kot2t2uva1 (Gape).
<HI>JR2MBHIKA1. Yawning or gaping. For the Pura1n2ic
<>story of how gape came into existence in the world, see
<>under Kot2t2uva1 (Gape).
<HI>JUHU. A King of the family of Yaya1ti. (Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).
<HI>JVA1LA1 I. A daughter of Taks2aka. The King R2ks2a mar-
<>ried her. Matina1ra was the son born to the couple.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 95. Stanza 25).
<HI>JVA1LA1 II. The wife of Ni1ladhvaja. There is a story about
<>this Jva1la1 in the “Jaimini As4vamedha Parva”, Chapter
<>15, as follows:
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas began the sacrifice of As4vamedha. Arjuna
<>led the sacrificial horse. He continued his victorious
<>march defeating all Kings and reached the city of Ni1la-
<>dhvaja. Ni1ladhvaja was not prepared for a fight. Seeing
<>this his wife Jva1la1 tried various ways to push her
<>husband to war. Seeing them to be futile she approa-
<>ched her brother Unmu1ka and asked him to fight with
<>Arjuna. He also was not prepared to fight with Arjuna.
<>Jva1la1 became very angry and walked to the bank of the
<>Ganges. When the Ganges-water touched her feet
<>she stopped and said, “Dear me ! I am become sinful [Page359-b+ 62]
<>by the touch of Ganges-water.” The amazed Gan3ga1
<>took the form of Suman3gala1devi1 and stood before Jva1la1
<>and aked her the reason for saying so. Jva1la1 said “Gan3-
<>ga1devi1 submerged her seven sons and killed them. After
<>that she took the eighth son from S4antanu. That son
<>too was killed by Arjuna in the Bha1rata-battle. Thus
<>Gan3ga1 is childless and sinful.” Hearing this Gan3ga1
<>Devi1 cursed Arjuna “Let his head be cut off in six
<>months’ time.” Jva1la1 was satisfied. (For the result of
<>the curse see under Arjuna, Para 28).
<HI>JVA1LA1JIHVA I. One of the two attendants given to
<>Subrahman2ya by Agnideva. (Fire god). Jyoti was the
<>other attendant. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza
<>33).
<HI>JVA1LA1JIHVA II. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 61).
<HI>JVA1LES4VARA. See under Tripura.
<HI>JVARA. (Jvaram) (Fever).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A fearful being. It is stated in the
<>Pura1n2as that living beings catch fever owing to the
<>activities of this monster.
<NI>2) {%The origin of jvara.%} Once S4iva and Pa1rvati1 were
<>talking with each other in the Holy Bath called Jyotis2-
<>kam on mount Maha1meru. On that day Daks2a had
<>performed a sacrifice at Gan3ga1dva1ra. S4iva alone was
<>not invited. Seeing the Gods Brahma1 and the others
<>going to that place through the sky, Pa1rvati1 asked S4iva
<>what the matter was. S4iva explained everything to
<>Pa1rvati1, who became very sorry because her husband
<>had not been invited. S4iva grew uneasy at the sorrow
<>of his wife. A drop of sweat fell down from his third
<>eye. A fearful monster with the lustre of fire arose
<>from that drop of sweat. That figure is described as
<>follows:
<NI>“A terrible monster, with dwarfish figure, staring eyes,
<>green moustaches, hair standing erect on head and
<>body covered with hair all over, looking like a combi-
<>nation of hawk and owl, with jet-black colour, wearing
<>a blood-coloured cloth.” (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chap-
<>ter 283).
<NI>“With three legs, three heads, six hands and nine eyes,
<>comes Jvara the terrible monster, as fierce as Yama
<>the god of death and fearful like a thousand clouds with
<>thunderbolt, gaping and sighing, with tight body and
<>horrible face, rendered so by many eyes.” (M.B. Vis2n2u
<>Parva, Chapter 122).
<NI>To this uncouth figure S4iva gave the name Jvara, who
<>dashed away and entered into all devas (gods). Brahma1
<>and the others caught fever and were laid up. At last
<>they all came to S4iva. Hearing their request S4iva
<>divided Jvara into several parts and separated them from
<>devas and entered them into other living beings, and
<>ordered that, headache for elephants, green coverings
<>for water, shedding of skin for snakes, hoof-rot for cows,
<>sore-throat for horses, feather-sprouting for peacocks,
<>sore-eye for cuckoo, hiccough for parrot, weariness
<>for tigers and fever for men will be caused by Jvara.
<NI>It was the time of the terrorization of Vr2tra1sura. Jvara
<>caught hold of that Asura also. It was at this time
<>that Indra used his thunderbolt and killed Vr2tra1sura.
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 283; M.B. Vis2n2u Parva,
<>Chapter 122). [Page360-a+ 65]
<HI>JYA1MAGHA. A King born in the dynasty of Iks2va1ku.
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 36).
<NI>Five sons, who were equal to gods, named Sahasrada,
<>Payoda, Kros2t2a1, Ni1la and A1jika were born to Yadu of
<>the family of Iks2va1ku. Several noble persons were born
<>in the family of Kros2t2a1. A noble and broadminded son
<>named Vr2jini1va1n was born to Kros2t2a1. S4va1hi was born
<>to Vr2jini1va1n, Rus4eku to S4va1hi, Citraratha to Rus4eku
<>and S4as4abindu to Citraratha. Thousand sons were born
<>to S4as4abindu who was an emperor. Important among
<>those thousand who were blessed with radiance, fame,
<>wealth and beauty, were Pr2thus4ravas, Pr2thuyas4as,
<>Pr2thutejas, Pr2thubhava, Pr2thuki1rti and Pr2thumati.
<>Us4anas was the son of Pr2thus4ravas, S4ineyu was the son
<>of Us4anas and Rukmakavaca the son of S4ineyu. Ruk-
<>makavaca killed all the archers and conquered the
<>countries and performing as4vamedha (horse sacrifice)
<>gave away all the countries he conquered, as gift to
<>Bra1hman2as. Five sons were born to Rukmakavaca. Jya1-
<>magha was one of them. His brothers were Rukmes2u,
<>Pr2thurukma, Parigha and Hari. Of them Parigha and
<>Hari were made Kings of foreign countries. Rukmes2u
<>was given the country ruled by his father. Pr2thurukma
<>served Rukmes2u. They drove Jya1magha away from the
<>country.
<NI>Jya1magha went to the forest and erected a hermitage
<>for him. Then according to the advice of a Brahmin, he
<>who was an old man took bow and arrow and got into
<>a chariot flying a flag and went to the bank of the
<>river Narmada1. He had neither wealth nor attendants.
<>He stayed on the mountain R2ks2ava1n eating fruits and
<>roots. His wife S4aibya1 also had become old. They had
<>no children. Still Jya1magha did not marry anybody
<>else. Once Jya1magha came out victorious in a fight in
<>which he got a girl. Jya1magha took the girl to his wife
<>and told her, “This girl shall be the wife of your son.”
<>She asked him how that could be when she had no
<>son. He said, “She will become the wife of the son who
<>is going to be born to you.” As a result of severe
<>penance a son named Vidarbha was born to S4aibya1.
<>The damsel who became the wife of Vidarbha gave
<>birth to two sons named Kratha and Kais4ika. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 13).
<HI>JYES2T2HA1 I. A deity of inauspicious things. In Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, it is observed that Jyes2t2ha1
<>was a goddess obtained by churning the Sea of Milk.
<>As soon as she came up from the sea of Milk, the
<>Trimu1rtis (Vis2n2u, Brahma1 and S4iva) found her and
<>sent her away ordering her to sit in inauspicious places.
<>The Goddess Jyes2t2ha1 came out of the Milk-Sea before
<>the goddess Laks2mi1. So this deity is considered the
<>elder sister of Laks2mi1. As she is the elder she is also
<>called Mu1dhevi1 (Mu1devi1). The mode of worshipping
<>this goddess is given in Bodha1yana Su1tra. Tondirat2ipoti-
<>a1lva1r, who was a Vais2n2ava A1lva1r, who lived in 7th
<>century A.D. said that it was useless to worship this
<>Goddess. Ancient images of this Goddess have been
<>found. But worship of Jyes2t2ha1 was completely disconti-
<>nued after the 10th century.
<NI>In S4aiva Pura1n2as it is mentioned that this Goddess
<>is one of the eight portions of Para1s4akti. It was believed
<>that the powers of this Goddess regulated human lives
<>in various ways.
<HI>JYES2T2HA1 II. A star. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 64, Stanza 24 that if Bra1h- [Page360-b+ 65]
<>man2as are given greens on the day of this star it will
<>bring good to the giver.
<HI>JYES2T2HA. A hermit who was well-versed in the Sa1ma-
<>Veda. This ancient hermit once received valuable advice
<>from the Sa1tvatas called Barhis2ads. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 348, Stanza 46).
<HI>JYES2T2HAPUS2KARA. A holy place. Those who visit this
<>holy place will get the fruits of performing the sacrifice
<>of Agnis2t2oma. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 200,
<>Stanza 66).
<HI>JYES2T2HASA1MA. A Sa1ma meditated upon by the
<>hermit Jyes2t2ha. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 348,
<>Stanza 46).
<HI>JYES2T2HILA1. A river. This river stays in the palace of
<>Varun2a worshipping him. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>9, Stanza 21).
<HI>JYES2T2HILA. A holy place. He who stays in this
<>holy place for a night will get the fruits of giving a
<>thousand cows as gift. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 84,
<>Stanza 164).
<HI>JYOTI I. Son of the Vasu named Aha. Mention is made
<>about him in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Stanza 23.
<HI>JYOTI II. One of the two attendants given to Subrah-
<>man2ya by the God Agni (fire). The second one was
<>Jva1la1jihva. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 33).
<HI>JYOTIKA. A famous serpent. This serpent was born to
<>Kas4yapa by his wife Kadru1. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Stanza 13).
<HI>JYOTIRATHA1. A famous river. The people of India
<>used to drink water from this river. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 26).
<HI>JYOTIRATHYA1. A river. He who bathes in this river
<>in the particular place where it merges with the river
<>S4on2abhadra1, would obtain the fruits of performing the
<>sacrifice of Agnis2t2oma. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 8).
<HI>JYOTIRVASU. A King born in the family of Puru1ra-
<>vas. He was the son of Sumati and the father of Prati1ka.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 9).
<HI>JYOTIS2A(M). (Astronomy and astrology). Jyotis2a is
<>the science about the stars and heavenly bodies. The
<>heavenly bodies are the sun, the moon, the other
<>planets and the stars etc. From the very ancient days
<>men believed that these planets and stars in the sky
<>played an important part in controlling the growth
<>and activities of all the living and non-living things
<>in the world.
<NI>Astrology has been a recognized science in Egypt, China
<>and India from very ancient days. History tells us that
<>3000 years before Christ there were astronomers in
<>Babylon. But even before that time astronomy had fully
<>expanded and grown in Bha1rata.
<NI>The Vedas are supposed to have six An3gas (ancillaries)
<>They are S4iks2a1 (Phonetics), Kalpa (ritual), Vya1karan2a
<>(Grammar), Jyotis2a (astronomy) Chandas (metrics),
<>and Nirukta (etymology). From this it can be said that
<>the Indians had acknowledged Astronomy as an anci-
<>llary of the Vedas. The expounders of the Vedas say
<>that Astronomy is the eye of the Vedas.
<NI>Astronomy has two sides, the doctrinal side (Prama1n2a-
<>bha1ga) and the result-side (Phalabha1ga). The Calendar
<>is reckoned in accordance with the Prama1n2a-bha1ga.
<>Prediction and casting horoscopes of living beings is the
<>Phala-bha1ga. [Page361-a+ 52]
<NI>The astronomers have divided the sky that surrounds
<>the earth into twelve parts called ra1s4 is (zodiacs). All
<>the stars of the first zodiac appear in the shape of a goat
<>(Mes2a) so that zodiac was called Mes2a. Thus the
<>zodiac in which the stars took the shape of an ox was
<>called R2s2abha (ox). In the zodiac Mithuna the stars
<>took the shape of a young couple. Karkat2aka means
<>crab. In that zodiac the stars appear in the shape of
<>a crab. In the same way Sim3ha means lion and Kanya1
<>means a damsel. Tula1 means balance and Vr2s4cika
<>means scorpion; Dhanus means bow and Makara means
<>Makara matsya (horned shark). Kumbha is a water
<>pot and Mi1na means fish. The name of the zodiac is
<>according to the sign of the zodiac. That is, in what
<>shape the stars in that particular zodiac appear to the
<>people of the earth. The figure of the twelve zodiacs
<>with the earth as centre is given below:--
<C1>Mi1na <C2>Mes2a <C3>R2s2abha <C4>Mithuna
<C1>Kumbha <C2>Karkat2aka
<C1>Makara <C2>Sim3ha
<C1>Dhanus <C2>Vr2s4cika <C3>Tula1 <C4>Kanya1
<NI>In Kerala and some other places the zodiacs are marked
<>to the right in order beginning with Mes2a, whereas it is
<>marked to the left in the same order in some of the
<>other parts of India.
<NI>The earth completes one rotation in 60 Na1d2ika1s (24
<>minutes) i.e. 24 hours. In each rotation these twelve
<>zodiacs face the earth. For a man standing at a parti-
<>cular point on the earth it will take 60% 12 i.e. 5
<>na1d2ika1s (two hours) on an average, for a zodiac to pass
<>him. But it may vary in different places according to
<>the difference of the shape of the earth. A month is the
<>time the sun remains in a zodiac. The planet Jupiter
<>takes a year and Saturn two years and a half on an
<>average to pass a zodiac. The calendar shows which
<>are the planets standing in each zodiac and how far
<>they have travelled at a particular time in that parti-
<>cular zodiac. When a particular zodiac is in a parti-
<>cular region of the earth, a man born in that region is
<>said to be born in that zodiac. When a particular
<>place faces the zodiac of Mes2a the child which takes
<>birth in that place is said to be born in the zodiac of
<>Mes2a. The zodiac of birth is given the name Lagna by
<>astronomers. Those who are well-versed in the result-
<>side of astronomy are of opinion that the life,
<>fortune etc. of living beings depend upon the position
<>of the planets in relation to their lagnas.
<HI>JYOTIS2KA. A famous serpent born to Kas4yapa by his
<>wife Kadru1. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 203,
<>Stanza 15).
<HI>JYOTIS2KA(M). A peak of mount Sumeru. (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 283, Stanza 5). [Page361-b+ 65]
<HI>JYOTIS2MA1N. An ancient King of Kus4advi1pa. This
<>King had seven sons, called Udbhida, Ven2uma1n,
<>Vairatha, Lambana, Dhr2ti, Prabha1kara and Kapila.
<>Each division of that country is given the name of each
<>of these sons. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 4).
<HI>JYOTSNA1KA1LI1. The second daughter of Candra. In
<>Maha1 Bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 98, Stanza 13,
<>it is mentioned that this daughter was extremely beauti-
<>ful and that the Sun married her.
<H>K
<HI>KA. This letter has the following meanings:
<NI>(i) Praja1pati. (S4loka 32, Chapter 1, A1di Parva, M.B.)
<NI>(ii) A name of Daks2apraja1pati. (S4loka 7, Chapter 208,
<>S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(iii) A name of Vis2n2u. (S4loka 91, Chapter 149, Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, M.B.)
<NI>(iv) Brahma1 (Vis2n2u, Mahes4vara). (Chapter 348, Agni
<>Pura1n2a, M.B.).
<HI>KABALABARHIS2A. A King of Vr2s2n2ivam3s4a. (See under
<>VR2S2N2IVAM3S4A).
<HI>KABANDHA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The demon who attacked Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a while they were wandering in Dan2d2a-
<>ka1ran2ya after the abduction of Si1ta1 by Ra1van2a.
<NI>2) {%Previous history of Kabandha.%} There was a King of Gan-
<>dharvas called S4ri1. He had a son named Danu. Danu
<>was known as Vis4va1vasu also. Vis4va1vasu once per-
<>formed a penance to propitiate Brahma1 for long life
<>and Brahma1 appeared before him and blessed him with
<>immortality. Arrogant of this acquisition he roamed
<>about as he pleased.
<NI>One day he attacked Indra and the latter furious at his
<>impudence used the Vajra1yudha on him and the head
<>and thighs of Vis4va1vasu were squeezed into his body.
<>Vis4va1vasu pleaded that he should be given some way
<>to take his food. Indra then granted him two very long
<>hands and a mouth on his belly. Then Vis4va1vasu spent
<>his days in a forest near the Matan3ga1s4rama in Kraun5-
<>ca1ran2ya bearing the name Kabandha (Headless trunk).
<>Indra added that he would attain his real form when
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a cut his hands.
<F>1) “I am the son of S4ri1 named Danu” says Kabandha to Laks2man2a in S4loka 8, Chapter 71, of the Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. In S4loka 42, Chapter 279 of Aran2ya Ka1n2da, Kabandha says, “I am a gandharva, Vis4va1vasu and came to be born in a demonaic
<>womb by the curse of a brahmin.”</F>
<NI>A favourite pastime of Kabandha was to frighten the
<>sages. One day he attacked a sage called Sthu1las4iras
<>and that sage cursed him saying that he would retain
<>his ugly figure for ever. The demon pleaded for relief
<>and the sage said that he would regain his original
<>figure when Ra1ma cut his hands and left him in the
<>desolate forest. From that day onwards Kabandha
<>lived there waiting for S4ri1 Ra1ma. (Sarga 70, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3). {%Kabandha meets Ra1ma and Laks2man2a.%} Jat2a1yu was
<>lying half dead by a blow from the sword of Ra1van2a
<>and Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went to him and talked to
<>him. He gave them some information regarding Si1ta1
<>before he died. After burning the body of Jat2a1yu in a
<>funeral pyre Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went westwards.
<>They entered the Kraun5ca1ran2ya and reached Matan3ga-
<>vana. There they saw a great cave. A huge demoness
<>attacked them near that cave and seeing the beautiful
<>form of Laks2man2a she invited him for amorous plays.
<>Laks2man2a cut off her ear, nose and breasts. Then they
<>entered deep into the forests. Bad omens greeted them. [Page362-a+ 65]
<>Before long they saw Kabandha rushing towards them.
<>He is described thus in the Maha1bha1rata:
<NI>“He was as big as a mountain, dark as a black cloud,
<>with pointed hairs all over his body and looked fierce
<>with a voice as loud as thunder. He had an eye on his
<>stomach, round and yellow, emitting a glare like a
<>fire-flame. Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out
<>of his huge mouth licking the sides.”
<NI>The demon stretched out his big hands and caught
<>hold of S4ri1 Ra1ma in his right hand and Laks2man2a in
<>his left hand. Finding themselves helpless in his hands
<>Laks2man2a implored Ra1ma to flee away from the
<>demon leaving him alone. S4ri1 Ra1ma cut off Kabandha's
<>right hand and Laks2man2a cut off the left hand.
<>Kabandha then asked them who they were. Kabandha
<>told Ra1ma and Laks2man2a his previous story and then
<>fell dead. Ra1ma and Laks2man2a burnt the dead body in
<>a funeral pyre. He rose up in the air as the Gandharva
<>King of old and advised S4ri1 Ra1ma to go to Sugri1va for
<>knowing more about Si1ta1. (Sargas 70 to 72, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>KACA. The first son of Br2haspati. That extremely
<>beautiful boy was a great favourite of the devas.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u--
<>Brahma1--An3giras--Br2haspati--Kaca.
<NI>2) {%How he studied the secret of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1.%} The
<>Devas and Asuras always quarrelled with each other.
<>Devas accepted Br2haspati as their guru and the asuras
<>made S4ukra1ca1rya their guru. S4ukra1ca1rya knew an art
<>which Br2haspati did not know, the secret of Mr2tasan5-
<>ji1vani1. When the devas cut the Asuras to pieces,
<>S4ukra1ca1rya used to bring them back to life by his
<>knowledge of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1. Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 is the art of
<>reviving the dead.
<NI>Devas were at a loss to know what to do. They wanted
<>to learn the secret of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 from S4ukra1ca1rya
<>somehow. It was imperative that they should learn it.
<>Then they found out a way. They sent Kaca, son of
<>Br2haspati, to S4ukra1ca1rya.
<NI>Kaca went to S4ukra1ca1rya and told him that he was
<>the son of Br2haspati and had come to him to be his
<>disciple for a period of a thousand years doing service
<>to him. The modesty of the boy appealed to S4ukra1ca1rya
<>and he accepted Kaca as his disciple.
<NI>Devaya1ni1, daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya, fell in love with
<>Kaca. They were always together as an inseparable
<>couple. Asuras did not like the advent of Kaca to the
<>A1s4rama of S4ukra1ca1rya. They knew that he had come
<>to study the secrets of the Asuras. Once Kaca went
<>alone to look after the cows and the Asuras followed
<>him stealthily. When Kaca entered deep into the
<>forest the Asuras killed him and gave him to the
<>wolves.
<NI>It became dusk. The cows returned to the A1s4rama
<>without the cowherd. Devaya1ni1 waited for a long
<>time for Kaca to come. Not seeing him Devaya1ni1 went
<>weeping to her father and said, “Oh, father, the sun
<>has set. You have performed your nightly fire sacrifice.
<>The cattle have come back by themselves and still
<>Kaca has not returned home. I fear he is dead or has
<>been killed. I cannot live without him.”
<NI>The affectionate S4ukra1ca1rya could not bear the sight
<>of his dear daughter weeping and so he went to the
<>forest with Devaya1ni1 and employing the art of
<>San5ji1vani1 he invoked the dead youth to appear. At [Page362-b+ 65]
<>once Kaca came back to life and stood before them.
<>All the three then returned to the a1s4rama happily.
<NI>The anger of the Asuras against Kaca knew no bounds.
<>On another occasion the Asuras seized him and after
<>killing him pounded his body into a paste and mixed
<>it up in sea-water. This time also, at the request of
<>Devaya1ni1, S4ukra1ca1rya brought him back to life.
<NI>The third time the Asuras burnt the body of Kaca and
<>mixed the ashes in wine and served it to S4ukra1ca1rya to
<>drink. The disciple thus went inside the belly of the
<>guru. Dusk came, the cattle came and still Kaca did
<>not return and Devaya1ni1 reported the matter to her
<>father. S4ukra1ca1rya sat for some time in meditation and
<>then he knew that Kaca was in his own stomach. If he
<>got Kaca out, he would burst his stomach and S4ukra
<>would die and if he did not get him out his daughter
<>would burst her heart and die. S4ukra1ca1rya was in a fix.
<>He asked Kaca how he got in and he replied that it
<>was through the wine. S4ukra imparted to Kaca the
<>art of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 and Kaca lying within the stomach
<>repeated it. Then S4ukra1ca1rya called Kaca by name
<>and Kaca came out bursting the stomach of his guru.
<>The preceptor lay dead and by employing the art of
<>Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 he had learnt, Kaca brought his guru
<>to life. S4ukra1ca1rya eschewed wine from that day
<>onwards and declared it as a forbidden drink to
<>brahmins. S4ukra1ca1rya said that because Kaca was
<>reborn from his stomach he must be deemed his son.
<NI>3) {%Kaca was cursed.%} Kaca remained for some more
<>time under the tutelage of S4ukra1ca1rya and when his
<>education became complete he took leave of his
<>preceptor and also Devaya1ni1. Devaya1ni1 followed him
<>for a long distance from the hermitage and requested
<>him to marry her. Kaca replied he could not do so
<>because he had become a brother to Devaya1ni1.
<>Devaya1ni1 got angry and cursed him saying that he
<>would not be able to use the art of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 he
<>had learnt from her father. Kaca cursed her back
<>saying that none of the sons of sages would marry her.
<>Kaca however felt relieved that though he would not

<>to do so. He went back to Devaloka and was heartily
<>welcomed by all the Devas. He then imparted the art
<>of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 to the devas. (Chapters 76 and 77,

<HI>KADALIGARBHA1. Daughter of the great sage
<>Man3kan2aka. There is a story about her in Katha1sarit-
<>sa1gara.
<NI>There was once a city called Iks2umati1. It was on the
<>banks of the river Iks2umati1. It was Vis4va1mitra who
<>set up that river and city. In a hermitage in the thick
<>forest on the shores of Iks2umati1 lived a sage, Man3ka-
<>n2aka performing penance. One day the beautiful
<>nymph Menaka1, came there from above. As a wind
<>blew, her upper garment was displaced. Seeing her
<>bare body, Man3kan2aka had emission. The semen of [Page363-a+ 65]
<>the sage fell into a Kadali1 (plantain) tree and from
<>there arose a maiden, extremely beautiful. Because she
<>was born from Kadali1 she was called Kadali1garbha1.
<>Kadali1garbha1 grew up into a beautiful lady and one
<>day a King named Dr2d2havarma1 came that way while
<>hunting and seeing Kadali1garbha1 he fell in love with her
<>and married her with the permission of Man3kan2aka.
<>The Devas advised her to scatter must2ard seeds on the
<>way to her husband's house and in case her husband
<>abandoned her she should be guided by the mustard
<>plants to return home. She did so.
<NI>One day by the evil advice of a barber the King
<>divorced her and she returned to the A1s4rama by
<>following the young mustard plants. But Man3kan2aka
<>took her back to the King. (Taran3ga 6, Madanaman5-
<>juka1lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>KADALI1VANA. This grove is situated on the banks of
<>Kuberapus2karin2i1 which abounded in Saugandhika
<>flowers. There were different kinds of plantain fruits of
<>golden hue in this grove. Hanu1ma1n resided in it.
<>chapter 146, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>KA1DAMBARI1 I. A river flowing westwards in Jambu1dvi1pa.
<>In Bha1gavata 5th Skandha it is said that this river got its
<>name “Ka1dambari1” because it had the hollow trunk
<>of a Kadamba tree as its source.
<HI>KA1DAMBARI1 II. An excellent story book in prose
<>written in Sanskrit by the great Sanskrit poet
<>Ba1n2abhat2t2a. Ka1dambari1 is the heroine of the story.
<HI>KADHMOR. A saintly King. He is worthy of being
<>remembered in the morning. (Chapter 165, Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva).
<HI>KADRU1. Wife of Kas4yapa and daughter of Daks2apraja1-
<>pati.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Vis2n2u--
<>Brahma1--Daks2a--Kadru1.
<NI>2) {%Kadru1--Wife or daughter of Kas4yapa?%} Whether Kadru1
<>was the wife or daughter of Kas4yapa is a question which
<>remains unanswered still in the Pura1n2as. Chapter 65 of
<>Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata states like this.
<NI>The six spiritual sons of Brahma1 are: Mari1ci, An3giras,
<>Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu. Mari1ci got a son
<>named Kas4yapa and he married the thirteen daughters
<>of Daks2a, namely, Aditi, Diti, Kala1, Dana1yus, Danu,
<>Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pradha1, Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1, Muni
<>and Kadru1. So according to this, Kadru1 was the wife of
<>Kas4yapa.
<NI>But the 14th Sarga of Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a states:
<NI>Daks2apraja1pati got sixty illustrious daughters and of
<>these Kas4yapa married--Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1
<>Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Muni and Surasa1. Krodhavas4a1
<>gave birth to eight daughters. They were: Mr2gi1, Mr2ga-
<>manda1, Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, S4veta1;
<>S4urabhi, Surasa1 and Kadru1.
<NI>Ta1mra1 another wife of Kas4yapa gave birth to five
<>daughters, namely, Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1
<>and S4uki1. Kraun5ci1 gave birth to owls, Bha1si1 to Bha1sas,
<>S4yeni1 to eagles and vultures, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 to swans and
<>S4uki1 to Nata1. Nata1 gave birth to Vinata1.
<NI>Thus, according to the Ra1ma1yan2a Kadru1 was the
<>daughter of Kas4yapa born of his wife Krodhavas4a1.
<>Again Vinata1 who is spoken of as the elder sister of
<>Kadru1 in Maha1bha1rata is the daughter of the grand-
<>daughter of Kas4yapa. This means that Kadru1's mother
<>and Vinata1's grand mother's mother were sisters. But [Page363-b+ 64]
<>both of them looked after Kas4yapa as if they were
<>direct sisters.
<NI>3) {%Kadru1, mother of serpents.%} Kadru1 and Vinata1 lived
<>serving Kas4yapa. Kas4yapa was pleased with them and
<>asked them what boon they wanted. Kadru1 asked for a
<>thousand serpents to be born of her and Vinata1 asked
<>for two sons who would be braver and more brilliant
<>than the sons of Kadru1. Kas4yapa granted them what
<>they asked for and when Kadru1 and Vinata1 became
<>pregnant he left for the forest.
<NI>After some time Kadru1 delivered a thousand eggs and
<>Vinata1 two eggs. Both of them kept the eggs in warm
<>jars and after five hundred years the thousand eggs of
<>Kadru1 burst letting out a thousand serpents. Vinata1
<>became impatient and broke open an egg of hers. Out
<>came from it a half developed being and that was
<>Arun2a. Arun2a cursed her for being impatient and said
<>“You let me out half developed because of your over-
<>anxiety and you will, therefore, become a servant of
<>Kadru1. Keep the other egg for another five hundred
<>years. Then a very powerful son will come out of it
<>and that son will relieve you of your servitude to
<>Kadru1”. So saying he rose up in the air and became
<>the charioteer of the sun. After five hundred years the
<>other egg of Vinata1 broke and Garud2a came out.
<>(Chapter 16, A1di Parva, M.B.)

<>prominent serpents. (Chapter 35, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Kadru1 curses her sons.%} Once Kadru1 called Vinata1 to
<>her side and asked her the colour of Uccais4s4ravas, the
<>horse of Indra. It was purely a white horse and Vinata1
<>told so. But Kadru1 said its tail was black. Each stood
<>firm in her statement and then Kadru1 made a bet. She
<>who was defeated in the bet should serve the other as
<>her slave. Vinata1 agreed. Kadru1 wanted to cheat Vinata1
<>and so asked her sons to remain suspended from the
<>tail of the horse in such an artful way that the tail
<>would look black from a distance. Some of her sons re-
<>fused to be a party to this deceit and Kadru1 cursed
<>them saying that they would all be burnt in the Sarpa-
<>sattra of Janamejaya. Kas4yapa did not like the curse.
<>But Brahma1 came there and said that the serpents
<>as a class were injurious to society and as such a curse
<>of that nature was necessary. Brahma1 then taught him
<>Vis2asam3ha1ravidya1 (Treatment of snake-poisoning).
<>(Chapter 20, A1di Parva, M.B.). [Page364-a+ 65]
<>6) {%Kadru1 and children go to Ra1man2i1yaka.%} Once Kadru1
<>told Vinata1. “Vinata1, take me to the island of Ra1ma-
<>n2i1yaka in the middle of the ocean. It is a beautiful place
<>to stay. Let your son, Garud2a, take my sons to that
<>place.” Vinata1 took Kadru1 and Garud2a took her
<>children during the journey. Garud2a rose high up in the
<>air nearing the sun and the serpents began to feel the
<>heat unbearable and began to get charred. Kadru1 then
<>prayed to Indra and the latter then sent a heavy down-
<>pour of rains. This saved the serpents from being burnt
<>to death and they reached the island of Ra1man2i1yaka
<>safe. (Chapters 25 and 26, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>7) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Kadru1 lives in the court of Brahma1 worshipping him.
<>(Chapter 11, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(ii) Kadru1 taking the form of Skanda--graha in an
<>infinitely minute size enters the wombs of women and
<>eats the embryo. (Chapter 230, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>KAHOD2A (KAHOD2AKA--KHAGODAKA). A sage
<>the disciple and son-in-law of Udda1laka. He was
<>the father of the sage As2t2a1vakra.
<NI>Udda1laka had another name “S4vetaketu”. He was a
<>sage who had personally seen and talked to the goddess
<>Sarasvati1. It was at that time that Kahod2aka became
<>his disciple. Kahod2aka who was of a gentle nature
<>served his preceptor for a long time and won his favour.
<>He was immensely pleased and after teaching the
<>necessary things gave his daughter Suja1ta1 in marriage
<>to Kahod2aka. In due course, Suja1ta1 became pregnant.
<>One day, the child in the womb cried out that there
<>was a mistake in his father's recitation of the Vedas.
<>Kahod2aka was displeased at this. He cursed the child
<>that he would be born with a body having eight bends
<>(curves). So the boy was named “As2t2a1vakra” (one
<>who has eight bends). Suja1ta1 who was poor, once sent
<>Kahod2aka to King Janaka for some money. Kahod2aka
<>who was defeated in a disputation was immersed in
<>water. As2t2a1vakra rescued his father. (See under As2t2a1-
<>vakra).
<HI>KAHOLA. An ancient sage who flourished in Indra's
<>assembly. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7).
<HI>KAIKASI1. Mother of Ra1van2a.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} From the wrath of Brahma1 the giant
<>Praheti was born and from Brahma1's hunger the demi-
<>god Heti was born. The son Vidyutkes4a was born to
<>Heti, of Bhaya1 the sister of Ka1la (God of death--Time).
<>Vidyutkes4a married Sa1lakat2an3ka1 the daughter of
<>Sandhya1. A son named Sukes4a was born to them.
<>Sukes4a married Devavati1 daughter of Man2imaya, a
<>Gandharva. Three sons Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1 and Ma1li1
<>were born to them. The three brothers Ma1lyava1n,
<>Suma1li1 and Ma1li1 married Sundari1, Ketumati1 and
<>Vasudha1 respectively, the three daughters of Narmada1,
<>a gandharva woman. To Suma1li1, by his wife Ketumati1,
<>were born the ten sons, Prahasta, Akampana, Vikat2a,
<>Ka1laka1mukha, Dhu1mra1ks2a, Dan2d2a, Supa1rs4va, Sam3-
<>hra1da, Pra1kva1ta and Bha1sakarn2a and four daughters
<>Veka1 (Br2ha1), Pus2potkat2a1, Kaikasi1 and Kumbhi1nasi1.
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} As Suma1li1 was walking through forests
<>with his wives and daughters, he saw so many Yaks2as
<>(demi-gods) going in planes to pay homage to
<>Vais4ravan2a. Suma1li1 understood that Vais4ravan2a
<>became worthy of homage because he was the son of
<>Vis4ravas. So he took his daughter Kaikasi1 and left
<>her in the house of Vis4ravas. After a while, being [Page364-b+ 65]
<>pleased with her services, Vis4ravas took her as his
<>wife. Once she requested her husband for children.
<>Accordingly she got Ra1van2a, Kumbhakarn2a and
<>Vibhi1s2an2a as sons.
<HI>KAIKEYI1 I.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} One of the wives of Das4a-
<>ratha, who had three wives, Kausalya1, Kaikeyi1 and
<>Sumitra1. It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 70, Stanza 28 that Kaikeyi1 was
<>the sister of Yudha1jit, the King of Kekaya. Kekaya
<>was seven days’ journey away from Ayodhya1.
<NI>2) {%Getting boons.%} In days of old there was a battle
<>between the devas and the asuras and Das4aratha went
<>to the world of Devas, with Kaikeyi1, in a chariot to
<>help Indra against the Asuras. The devas were in a
<>sorry plight due to the illusive and sorcerous mode of
<>fighting of S4ambara the Asura and his men. Das4aratha
<>faced the Asuras in ten directions at the same time and
<>fought with them. In this fight his chariot had to be
<>turned to every direction and up and down so swiftly
<>that the bolt of the wheel slipped out and the wheel
<>was about to come off when Kaikeyi1 inserted her thumb
<>in the hole of the bolt and kept the chariot safe and
<>steady. The King was not aware of this bravery on the
<>part of his wife. At last when he came to know of this
<>he promised to give her two boons. The queen said
<>that she would ask for those two boons later as she
<>didn't want anything then. After this the King and
<>the queen returned to their country. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Sarga 9; Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Request for the boons and the forest life of S4ri1 Ra1ma.%} As
<>the celebration of anointing S4ri1 Ra1ma as the Heir
<>apparent in Ayodhya1 was going on, the humpy
<>Manthara1 approached Kaikeyi1 and advised her on the
<>ways of making her son Bharata King and sending S4ri1
<>Ra1ma to forest. At first Kaikeyi1 refused to agree to
<>this, but at last she succumbed to the repeated advice
<>of Manthara1. Das4aratha came to see Kaikeyi1 who was
<>lying in grief. Making use of this opportunity Kaikeyi1
<>requested for the granting of the two boons promised
<>earlier. One boon was that Bharata should be anointed
<>as heir apparent making use of the preparations made
<>for S4ri1 Ra1ma and the other boon was that S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>should live in forest, wearing bark of trees and matted
<>hair for fourteen years. When Das4aratha heard these
<>requests he became unconscious. But he granted her
<>wishes.
<HI>KAIKEYI1 II. Wife of Ajami1d2ha, a King of the Pu1ru
<>dynasty. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Stanza 37).
<HI>KAIKEYI1 III. Sudes2n2a1, the wife of the King of Vira1t2a
<>was known by the name Kaikeyi1 also. She was the
<>daughter of Kekaya, the King of Su1ta, born of his wife
<>Ma1lavi1. As she was the daughter of Kekaya, she got
<>the name Kaikeyi1. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 16).
<>Besides, it is stated in the Pura1n2as that all the princess-
<>es of the kingdom of Kekaya were called by the name
<>Kaikeyi1.
<HI>KAILA1SA (KAILA1SAKA). A serpent belonging to the
<>Kas4yapa family. Mention is made about this serpent
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Stanza
<>11.
<HI>KAILA1SA
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The mount Maha1meru has an

<>eastern side of this mount there are two mountains
<>called Jat2hara and Devaku1t2a. Pavama1na and Pa1riya1tra
<>are the two mountains on the western side. On the
<>south there are the two mountains of Kaila1sa and
<>Karavi1ra. The two mountains on the north are called
<>Tris4r2n3ga and Makaragiri. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapters 109 and 141 that the abodes of
<>S4iva and Kubera are on the mount Kaila1sa. Once, to
<>please S4iva, Maha1vis2n2u performed penance on Kaila1sa.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 222, Stanzas 33 to 40). It
<>is mentioned in Maha1 Bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>3 that the mountain Maina1ka stands to the north of
<>Kaila1sa. Once Vya1sa went to Kaila1sa. (M.B. Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 43, Stanza 17). In Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 106, mention is made that the King Sagara,
<>with his two queens, once went to Kaila1sa for penance.
<>It was on the Kaila1sa that Bhagi1ratha performed
<>penance to propitiate S4iva to bring down Gan3ga1.
<>Kaila1sa is hundred yojanas high. The devas come to
<>this place daily and return. It is mentioned in Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 141, that in the place where Kubera
<>lives on Kaila1sa there live a large number of Yaks2as
<>(demi-gods), Ra1ks2asas (giants) Kinnaras (heavenly
<>musicians), Garud2as (hawks) Ma1tan3gas (elephants)
<>and Gandharvas (semi-gods). The lake of lotus of
<>Kubera which was reached by Bhi1masena once, was in
<>Kaila1sa. In Vana Parva, it is mentioned that the
<>Pa1n2d2avas visited Kaila1sa during their forest life. It
<>could be understood from Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 83 that Ka1madhenu performed penance
<>on the Kaila1sa, once.
<HI>KAIRA1TA PARVA. A sub section of Vana Parva in

<HI>KAIT2ABHA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Kait2abha was the brother of
<>Madhu, an Asura (demon). These two brothers are
<>known in the Pura1n2as as Madhu-Kait2abhas.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} In the Pura1n2as, two stories slightly different
<>from each other, occur about the birth of Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. One story occurs in Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10 and the other in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti
<>Parva. In Devi1 Pura1n2a, Chapter 1, it is stated as
<>follows:--
<NI>In the beginning there was no earth or any other
<>planet. There was only water. Maha1vis2n2u slept on the
<>surface of the water. From the navel of Maha1vis2n2u the
<>stalk of a lotus grew up and there was a lotus flower
<>at the end of the stalk. Brahma1 was born in the lotus
<>flower. Brahma1 stayed in the flower in deep meditation
<>reciting the Vedas. Ear-wax flowed out from both the
<>ears of Maha1vis2n2u. From the ear-wax two Asuras
<>Madhu and Kait2abha were born.
<NI>The following occurs in the Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 348 about the birth of Madhu-
<>Kait2abhas.
<NI>A lotus flower grew up from the navel of Maha1vis2n2u
<>and Brahma1 was born in the flower. In the flower there
<>were two drops of water created by Maha1vis2n2u. One
<>drop was as sweet as honey and from that drop was
<>born the Asura Madhu with the attributes of tamas [Page365-b+ 65]
<>(darkness). The other drop was hard and from it
<>Kait2abha was born with the attribute of Rajas
<>(activity).
<NI>3) {%Madhu-Kait2abhas’ acquiring boons.%} Madhu-Kait2abhas
<>were born in water, grew up in water and walked on
<>the surface of water, haughty and arrogant. They
<>began to think about how the big flood of water came
<>into existence. Then Devi1 appeared before them and
<>taught them the mantra or incantation of Va1gbi1ja
<>(origin of logos). Reciting this mantra, Madhu and
<>Kait2abha worshipped Devi1 for thousand years. Devi1
<>appeared and asked them what they wished. They
<>wanted the boon that death should befall them only as
<>they desired. Devi1 granted them the boon. After this
<>they became haughtier because of the boon, and lived
<>in the water playing with the creatures in water having
<>nobody to confront them (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 1).
<NI>4) {%The theft of the Vedas.%} Madhu Kait2abhas saw
<>Brahma1 lying in the lotus flower reciting the four
<>Vedas which he had created. They caught hold of all
<>the Vedas and went to Pa1ta1la, (the nether world) and
<>hid themselves there. Brahma1 grew sad at the loss of
<>the Vedas and followed Madhu-Kait2abhas, who began
<>to attack Brahma1. At this Brahma1 became terribly
<>afraid of the Asuras and ran to Maha1vis2n2u who was
<>lying in a deep sleep of contemplation. Brahma1 praised
<>him. Maha1vis2n2u woke up. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>10).
<NI>5) {%The death of Madhu and Kait2abha.%} According to the
<>request of Brahma1, Maha1vis2n2u confronted Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. Madhu engaged Vis2n2u in fighting while
<>Kait2abha took rest and when Madhu became tired,
<>Kait2abha engaged Vis2n2u in fighting. Thus the fight
<>went on for a long time and Vis2n2u became tired of
<>continuous fight. Vis2n2u understood that owing to the boon
<>given by Devi1 the Asuras would die only if they wished
<>for death, and that no body could kill them. So Vis2n2u
<>began to meditate on Devi1, who said “It would never
<>be possible for you to kill Madhu and Kait2abha
<>because of my boon. They could be killed only by
<>deceit. So you may kill them deceitfully”.
<NI>Hearing these words Maha1vis2n2u approached the Asuras
<>and said to them. “I am much pleased with you. So
<>you may ask for any boon.” Hearing this they laughed
<>and said that they were more powerful than Vis2n2u
<>and that he might ask of them any boon. Taking that
<>opportunity Maha1vis2n2u said “Oh ! powerful persons.
<>I ask you to grant me this boon. Give me the boon to
<>kill you.” This request shook them. They were willing
<>to be killed at any place except water. They thought
<>that Vis2n2u would not be powerful enough to kill them.
<>Maha1vis2n2u instantly raised his thighs which were
<>enlarged to a great extent over the water as solid earth
<>seeing which the Asuras enlarged their bodies to the
<>extent of a thousand yojanas. But Maha1vis2n2u enlarged
<>his thighs further, caught hold of Madhu and Kait2a-
<>bha, laid them on his thighs and cut off their heads
<>with his discus. All the surface of the sea was covered
<>with the medas (fat) of these Asuras. This medas of
<>Madhu and Kait2abha collected itself into a lump and
<>became the earth. So the earth got the name ‘Medini1’.
<>As the earth was the fat of the Asuras it was not fit for
<>food. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 1).
<NI>6) {%The so of Madhu-Kait2abhas.%} A horrible son named
<>Dhundhu was born to Madhu-Kait2abhas. He lived [Page366-a+ 64]
<>under the sand in a wilderness called Ujja1lakam. A
<>King of the Iks2va1ku family named Kuvalaya1s4va killed
<>Dhundhu. So Kuvalaya1s4va got the name Dhundhu-
<>ma1ra. See under Dhundhu. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana

<>Ka1ki1, Halima1, Brahmika1, Ma1lini1, Pala1la1, A1rya1 and
<>Mitra1. (M.B. Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 228, Verse 10).
<HI>KA1KA (CROW).
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Kas4yapa was the son of Mari1ci, who was
<>the son of Brahma1. Kas4yapa's wife Ta1mra1 had many
<>daughters like Ka1ki1, S4yeni1, Bha1si1, Gr2dhr2ka1, S4uki1 and
<>Gri1va1. From Ka1ki1 were born the crows in the world.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 19).
<NI>2) {%Crows--the symbol of sin.%} There is a reference in
<>S4iva Pura1n2a to this. Long ago the King of Ka1s4i1 had a
<>daughter named Kala1vati1. Even in her youth, she
<>received the “S4aiva pan5ca1ks2ara mantra.” After that,
<>she was married by Da1s4a1rha, King of Mathura1, who
<>was a sinner. When he touched Kala1vati1 who was a
<>holy woman, he experienced unbearable heat. Kala1vati1
<>said that it was because of the King's sin. So she took
<>Da1s4a1rha to the sage Garga, who purified Da1s4a1rha with
<>his mantras (incantations) and made him stand in
<>water. At once the King's sins came out of his body
<>in the shape of crows. Some of them flew away. Many
<>of them fell down with their wings burnt. Seeing this,
<>the sage Garga said that all those crows were the
<>volume of sins accumulated in the course of the innu-
<>merable births through which he had passed. (S4iva
<>Pura1n2a, Pan5ca1ks2ara Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>3) {%The Crow and Rice-offerings.%} In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a
<>there is a story about the crow's right to eat the
<>offering of rice to Pitr2s. Once a King named Marutta
<>performed a Mahes4vara sattra. Indra and other gods
<>attended the sattra. Hearing about this, Ra1van2a came
<>that way. The frightened gods fled away assuming the
<>forms of different birds. Yama escaped in the form of
<>a crow. From that time, Yama was pleased with crows.
<>He gave a blessing that in future, when human beings
<>worship the pit2rs by offering rice to them, the crows
<>will have the right to eat that rice. Thus the right of
<>the crows to eat offerings of rice, originated from that
<>time. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>KAKS2A. A place of habitation of ancient Bha1rata.
<>(S4loka 49, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).

<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Kaks2asena was a member of the court of Yama.
<>(Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) Kaks2asena was considered to be one among the

<>ri1s2a, Janamejaya, Vr2s2a1darbhi, Paras4ura1ma, S4ri1 Ra1ma,
<>Karandhama and Mitrasaha who had attained salva-
<>tion by their charity and righteousness. Maha1bha1rata
<>states that Kaks2asena the saintly king attained
<>salvation by presenting gifts to the great Vasis2t2ha.
<>(S4loka 14, Chapter 137, Anus4a1sana Parva).

<HI>KAKS2I1VA1N I. This was a R2s2i well praised in the
<>R2gveda.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} King Kalin3ga did not have children for a
<>long time. The King, therefore requested the sage
<>Di1rghatamas (Gautama) to get a son for him by his
<>queen. The sage consented. But the queen did not
<>like to sleep with the old sage. She therefore requested
<>her servant maid, Us4i1, to lie with the sage. Kaks2i1va1n
<>was the son born to Di1rghatamas of Us4i1. (Su1kta 125,
<>Anuva1ka 18, Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) He was of the family of An3giras and he lived in a

<>Kan2va are seven Barhis2ads (a set of manes born of
<>Brahma1) who are also gurus of Indra living in the east.

<>a hundred pitchers of liquor by the As4vins. (Su1kta 116,
<>Anuva1ka 17, Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<NI>(vi) Kaks2i1va1n who was returning home from the
<>a1s4rama of the preceptor after completin2g his education
<>spent one night at a place on the way. In the morning
<>when he awoke he saw Svanaya son of King Bha1va-
<>yavya before him. The beautiful boy had strayed to that
<>place by accident while playing with his friends nearby.
<>Kaks2i1va1n was attracted by the enchanting features of
<>the boy and decided to make him the husband of his
<>daughter. Svanaya on knowing the details regarding [Page367-a+ 64]
<>Kaks2i1va1n took him to his father's palace and the King
<>received the sage with respect and gave him many
<>presents. (Su1kta 125, Anuva1ka 18, Man2d2ala 1,
<>R2gveda).
<HI>KAKS2I1VA1N II. A King of ancient India. He was the

<>120, A1di Parva).
<HI>KA1KS2I1VA1N. A son of Mahars2i Gautama. Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 3 states that at the
<>time when Gautama was living in Girivraja, he had
<>connection with a S4u1dra woman of Us4i1nara land and
<>as a result of it Ka1ks2i1va1n was born to her. This
<>Gautama was not the husband of Ahalya1.
<F>1) It is also stated elsewhere that Ka1ks2i1va1n was the son of Di1rghatamas, the father of Gautama. See under Dir2ghatamas.</F>
<>Ka1ks2i1va1n had a son named Can2d2akaus4ika and two
<>daughters named Bhadra1 and Ghos2a1. Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 17 states that Ka1ks2i1va1n
<>flourished in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly.
<HI>KA1KS2I1VATASUTA1. A female sage named Ghos2a1 who
<>was the daughter of the sage Ka1ks2i1va1n. As she was
<>suffering from the disease of leprosy, no one was pre-
<>pared to marry her. She composed a mantra in praise
<>of the As4vini1devas. They cured her of her disease.

<HI>KA1LA I.
<F>2.) Ka1la and Dharma are not the same person. See under Dharma.</F>(YAMA). The god of Death. When the life
<>span of each living being allotted by Brahma1 is at an
<>end Yama sends his agents and takes the soul to Yama-
<>puri1 (the city of Yama). From there, the holy souls
<>are sent to Vaikun2t2ha (Heaven, the abode of Vis2n2u) and
<>the sinful souls to Hell.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth of Yama.%} From Maha1vis2n2u were
<>descended in the following order--Brahma1, Mari1ci,
<>Kas4yapa, Su1rya (Sun), Yama (Ka1la).
<NI>Su1rya married Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1. They
<>had three children, Manu, Yama and Yami1. Of them,
<>Yama has the task of taking away the souls of those
<>whose life-span is at an end. Once Sam3jn5a1 who was
<>unable to bear the dazzling brilliance of Su1rya, ordered
<>her maid Chha1ya1 to attend on him and went to the
<>forest for performing penance. Mistaking her for his
<>wife Sam3jn5a1, Su1rya begot of her three sons namely,
<>S4anis4cara, Manu and Tapati1. Once Chha1ya1 cursed
<>Yama for disobedience. Then Su1rya and Yama under-
<>stood that she was not Sam3jn5a1. After that the As4vini1-
<>kuma1ras, Revanta and Bhaya1 were born to Su1rya and
<>Sam3jn5a1. Thus Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part III, Chapter 2 says
<>that Yama was the brother of Manu, Yami1, the
<>As4vini1 Kuma1ras, Tapati1, S4anais4cara and Bhaya1. Yama's
<>sister Bhaya1 was married by the Asura, Heti. Suni1tha1
<>was the eldest daughter of Yama. Am3ga married her.
<>The famous King Vena was her son. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Part I, Chapter 13).
<NI>2) {%Yama is a Dikpa1laka.%} Once Kubera offered penance
<>to Brahma1 for ten thousand years in water, head down-
<>wards and in the middle of Pan5ca1gni. Brahma1 who was
<>pleased, appeared before him and Kubera prayed to him
<>that he should be made one of the Lokapa1lakas. Accord-
<>ingly Brahma1 ordered that thenceforth, Indra should
<>rule in the East, Yama in the South, Varun2a in the
<>West and Kubera in the North. Yama's city is called
<>Sam3yamini1. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%Curse on Yama.%} Yama was once cursed by the sage
<>An2i Ma1n2d2avya. It was as a result of it that Yama was
<>born as Vidura. (For details see under An2ima1n2d2avya).
<NI>4) {%Yama became Mahars2i.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma who returned after
<>his forest life became king of Ayodhya1. He ruled over [Page368-a+ 65]
<>the country for 11,000 years. Then it was time to recall
<>Maha1vis2n2u who had incarnated as S4ri1 Ra1ma, to Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. Brahma1 sent Yama to the earth to bring back
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma. Yama who assumed the guise of a young
<>Mahars2i, went to Ayodhya1 and visited S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>He said that he was the disciple of the sage Atibala and
<>had come to tell him a secret. So Laks2man2a was posted
<>at the entrance to prevent anyone from entering the
<>room. It was announced that anyone who tried to enter
<>would be slaughtered. After that, while S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>Yama were having their secret talk, Durva1sas, the sage,
<>who was hungry after a fast of 1,000 years, arrived at
<>the door, asking for food. Laks2man2a told him humbly
<>that he could not be allowed to enter just then.
<>Durva1sas, who became furious, was about to curse the
<>whole race of Kings. So Laks2man2a entered the room
<>and informed S4ri1 Ra1ma of the arrival of Durva1sas. At
<>the same time, in fulfilment of the order, he was ready
<>to be slaughtered. Vasis2t2ha suggested that it would be
<>enough if Laks2man2a was banished from the palace.
<>Accordingly he was expelled and he went and drowned
<>himself in the depths of the river Sarayu1. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>who was broken-hearted at his separation from Laks2-
<>man2a went to the same river and drowned himself there
<>shortly after. Yama then took their souls to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>5) {%Yama became crow.%} In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a there is
<>a story that at Marutta's Ya1ga, Yama who was frighten-
<>ed at the sight of Ra1van2a, escaped in the form of a
<>crow. (For details, see under Crow).
<NI>6) {%An Age without Yama.%} In the Pura1n2as there are refe-
<>rences to three periods when there was no Yama.
<NI>(1) One such period was in Kr2tayuga. At that time
<>there was no death on earth which became overcrowded
<>with living beings. Unable to bear their weight, the
<>earth sank down to a depth of 100 yojanas. The goddess
<>of Earth offered tearful prayers to Maha1vis2n2u, who
<>incarnated as Vara1ha (pig) and lifted up the earth 100
<>yojanas. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<NI>(2) When Ma1rkan2d2eya reached the age of sixteen,
<>Yama went to him to take away his life. Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>hid himself behind the idol of S4iva. Yama threw his
<>noose at him but it fell round S4iva's neck. S4iva opened
<>his third eye and glared at Yama who was burnt to
<>ashes in its fire. (See under Ma1rkan2d2eya).
<NI>(3) See under Pa1n5ca1li1, Para 1, Sub Para 2.
<NI>7) {%Yama returned Satyava1n's Life.%} (See under Satyava1n).
<NI>8) {%Yama and King Nr2ga.%} See under Nr2ga.
<NI>9) {%Yamapuri1 (the city of Yama).%} Yamapuri1 is thousand
<>yojanas in extent. There is an entrance on each of the
<>four sides. On one side of the city stands Citragupta's
<>mansion. The fort surrounding the city is made of iron.
<>There are a hundred streets in Yamapuri1. They are all
<>decorated with banners and festoons. There is a group of
<>people in Citragupta's mansion. They are engaged in
<>calculating the life-span of living beings. They take into
<>account the vices and virtues of human beings. To the
<>south of Citragupta's residence is situated “Jvara-
<>mandira” (the abode of diseases). Adjacent to it are
<>the abodes of all kinds of diseases, each disease having
<>its own abode. Yama's home is situated at a distance
<>of twenty yojanas from the abode of Citragupta. It has
<>an area of two hundred yojanas and a height of fifty
<>yojanas. It is supported by one thousand columns. On
<>one side of it there is an extensive assembly hall. It is [Page368-b+ 65]
<>here that those who have led virtuous lives in the world,
<>find their abode after death. They lead a life of eternal
<>heavenly bliss there. (Garud2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 14).
<NI>(10) {%Naraka (Hell).%} There is a world called Pitr2loka in
<>the middle of the three worlds, on their southern side
<>below the earth and above the Atala loka. The Agnis2-
<>va1ttas and other pit2rs stay there in meditative trance
<>for securing prosperity to those who come to pitr2loka.
<>Yama is the ruler of pitr2loka. Since he is scrupulous in
<>imparting justice, Yama is also called Yamadharma.
<>He administers justice with an even hand to all living
<>beings brought there by his agents, according to their
<>virtues and vices during their earthly lives. He has
<>power to assess the virtues and vices of people and to
<>assign suitable punishments to them, but not to alter
<>the laws or methods of punishment. Sinners are sent to
<>the different Narakas by Yamadharma according to the
<>nature and seriousness of their sins. The Pura1n2as refer
<>to twentyeight Narakas in all. They are:--
<NI>(1) {%Ta1misram2.%} Those who rob others of their wealth,
<>wives, children etc, are bound with ropes by Yama's
<>servants and cast into the Naraka known as Ta1misram.
<>There, they are given sound beating until they faint.
<>After they recover their senses, the beating is repeated
<>and those who try to escape are bound hand and foot
<>and pushed again into this hell. This is repeated as long
<>as Fate has ordained.
<NI>(2) {%Andhata1mtsram.%} This hell is intended for the wife
<>who takes food after deceiving the husband or the hus-
<>band who takes food after deceiving his wife. The
<>punishmen there is the same as that of Ta1misram except
<>the beating. But the excruciating pain suffered by the
<>victims on being tied fast with Yama's rope by his
<>servants, makes them fall down senseless.
<NI>(3) {%Rauravam.%} This is the hell into which those who
<>have persecuted other living beings are cast. Those
<>who seize and enjoy another man's property or resour-
<>ces, also come under ‘Persecution’. When such people
<>are thrown into this hell, those whom they had per-
<>secuted or cheated while on earth, assume the shape
<>of “ruru” and torment them severely. “Ruru” is a
<>kind of dreadful serpent. This hell is known as “Raura-
<>vam” because of the abundance of rurus there.
<NI>(4) {%Maha1rauravam.%} Here also there are ruru serpents.
<>Only they are of a fiercer type. Those who deny the
<>legitimate heirs, their inheritance and possess and enjoy
<>others’ property, are squeezed to death by these terrible
<>serpents coiling round them.
<NI>(5) {%Kumbhi1pa1kam.%} This is the hell for the punishment
<>of those who kill and eat birds and animals. Here, oil is
<>kept boiled in huge vessels. Yama's servants plunge
<>sinners into this oil. The period of their torture extends
<>to as many years as there were hairs on the bodies of
<>the birds or animals which they killed and ate.
<NI>(6) {%Ka1lasu1tram (Yamasu1tra).%} This hell is terribly hot. It
<>is here that those who do not respect their father,
<>mother, elders, etc. are cast. They rush about in the
<>unbearable heat of this hell and drop down exhausted,
<>from time to time.
<NI>(7) {%Asi(ta)patram.%} This is the hell in which those sinners
<>who abandon svadharma (one's own duty) and accept
<>Paradharma (others’ duty) are flogged by Yama's
<>servants with whips made of asipatra (sharp-edged
<>sword-shaped leaves). When they run about under
<>the flogging they trip over stones and thorns and fall on [Page369-a+ 64]
<>their faces. Then they are stabbed with knives made of
<>asipatra. They drop down unconscious and when they
<>recover their senses, the same process is repeated.
<NI>(8) {%Su1karamukham.%} Kings who neglect their duties and
<>oppress their subjects by misrule, are punished in this
<>hell. They are crushed to a pulp by beating until they
<>fall down unconscious and when they recover, they
<>are again subjected to the same treatment.
<NI>(9) {%Andhaku1pam.%} This is the hell for punishing those
<>who oppress Bra1hman2as, gods and the poor. In this
<>Ku1pa (well) there are wild beasts like tiger, bear etc.
<>carnivorous birds like eagle, kite etc. venomous crea-
<>tures like snakes and scorpions and insects like bugs,
<>mosquitoes, etc. The sinners have to endure the cons-
<>tant attacks of these creatures, until the expiry of the
<>period of their punishment.
<NI>(10) {%Kr2mibhojanam (Food for worms).%} Depraved Bra1h-
<>man2as who take their food without worshipping gods
<>and honouring guests, are thrown into this “Kr2mi-
<>bhojana” Naraka which is one lakh yojanas in extent.
<>Worms, insects and serpents sting them and eat them up.
<>Once their bodies are completely eaten up by these
<>creatures, they are provided with new bodies, which
<>are also eaten up in the above manner. They have to
<>continue there in this manner, till the end of their term
<>of punishment.
<NI>(11) {%Taptamu1rti.%} Those who plunder or steal other
<>people's gold, jewels, ornaments or money are cast
<>into the furnaces of this Naraka, which is built of iron
<>and always remains red hot with blazing fire.
<NI>(12) {%S4a1lmali.%} This Naraka is intended for men and
<>women who have committed adultery. A figure made of
<>iron, heated red-hot is placed there. The victim is
<>urged to embrace it. Yama's servants flog the victim
<>from behind.
<NI>(13) {%Vajrakan2t2akas4a1li.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<>of those who have unnatural intercourse with cows and
<>other animals. Here, the guilty people are made to
<>embrace iron images full of diamond needles.
<NI>(14) {%Vaitaran2i1.%} This is the Naraka for Kings who have
<>violated all ordinances of S4a1stras and for adulterers. It
<>is the most terrible place of punishment. Vaitaran2i1 is
<>a river filled with human excreta, urine, blood, hair,
<>bones, nails, flesh, fat and all kinds of dirty substances.
<>There are various kinds of ferocious beasts in it. Those
<>who are cast into it are attacked and mauled by these
<>creatures from all sides. The sinners have to spend the
<>term of their punishment, feeding upon the contents of
<>this river.
<NI>(15) {%Pu1yodakam.%} This is a well, filled with excreta,
<>urine, blood, phlegm etc. Bra1hman2as and others who
<>have intercourse with women of low caste against
<>customs, ordinances etc. vagabonds who wander about
<>irresponsibly like animals and birds and other such
<>sinners are cast into this Naraka.
<NI>(16) {%Pra1n2arodham.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<>of Bra1hman2as who keep dogs, asses and other mean
<>animals and constantly hunt and kill animals for food.
<>Here the servants of Yama gather round the sinners and
<>cut them limb by limb with their arrows and subject
<>them to constant insult.
<NI>(17) {%Vis4asanam.%} This Naraka is for the torture of those
<>who perform Ya1ga by killing cows to display their
<>wealth and splendour. They will have to remain there [Page369-b+ 64]
<>during the whole term of their punishment under the
<>constant flogging of Yama's servants.
<NI>(18) {%La1la1bhaks2am.%} This is the Naraka for lustful people.
<>The lascivious fellow who makes his wife swallow
<>semen, is cast into this hell. La1la1bhaks2am is a sea of
<>semen. The sinner lies in it feeding upon semen alone.
<NI>(19) {%Sa1rameya1s4anam.%} Those guilty of unsocial acts
<>like incendiarism, poisoning food, mass slaughter,
<>ruining the country, etc. are cast into the Naraka
<>called Sa1rameya1s4ana. There, nothing but the flesh of
<>dogs is available for food. There are 700 dogs in that
<>Naraka and all of them are as ferocious as leopards.
<>They attack the sinners who come there from all sides
<>and tear their flesh from their bodies with their teeth.
<NI>(20) {%Avi1ci.%} This Naraka is for those guilty of bearing
<>false witness, false swearing or assuming false names.
<>They are hurled into Avi1ci from a mountain which is
<>100 yojanas in height. The whole region of Avi1ci is
<>always shaken like an ocean with turbulent waves. As
<>soon as the sinners fall into it they are utterly smashed
<>into dust. They are again restored to life and the
<>punishment is repeated.
<NI>(21) {%Ayah2pa1nam.%} Those who belong to the first three
<>castes--viz. Bra1hman2as, Ks2atriyas and Vais4yas--who
<>indulge in drinking Soma, Sura1 etc. are bound and
<>thrown into this hell. They are forced to drink melted
<>iron in liquid form.
<NI>(22) {%Ks2ha1rakardamam.%} Braggarts and those who insult
<>people of noble birth are cast into this hell. Here,
<>Yama's servants keep the sinners upside down and
<>torture them in various ways.
<NI>(23) {%Raks2obhaks2am.%} This Naraka is for the punishment
<>of meat-eaters. There are separate compartments in
<>this hell for those who perform human sacrifice, eat
<>human flesh or the flesh of other creatures. All the
<>living beings they had killed before, would have arrived
<>here in advance. They would all join together in
<>attacking, biting and mauling these sinners. Their
<>shrieks and complaints would be of no avail there.
<NI>(24) {%S4u1laprotam.%} People who take the life of others
<>who have done no harm to them, by deceiving them
<>or by treachery, with weapons like the trident, are
<>thrown into the “S4u1laprotam” hell. Yama's servants
<>fix each of the sinners of the above class, on the top
<>of a trident. They are forced to spend the whole term
<>of their punishment in that position, suffering intense
<>thirst and hunger, enduring all the tortures inflicted on
<>them by Yama's servants.
<NI>(25) {%Dandas4u1kam.%} Sinners who persecute fellow
<>creatures like venomous serpents are cast into this
<>Naraka. There are many wild beasts and many hooded
<>serpents here. They eat alive, the sinners who fall into
<>this hell.
<NI>(26) {%Vat2arodham.%} This hell is for those who persecute
<>the creatures living on mountain-peaks, dense forests,
<>hollow trunks of trees, etc. It resembles mountains,
<>caves, forests etc. After throwing them into this hell
<>the sinners are tortured with fire, snake, poison and
<>weapons, just as they had tortured other creatures,
<>while on earth.
<NI>(27) {%Parya1vartanakam.%} One who denies food to a
<>person who happens to come at meal-time and abuses
<>him, is thrown into this Naraka. The moment he falls
<>into it, his eyes are put out by being pierced with the [Page370-a+ 64]
<>beaks of cruel birds like the crow, eagle etc. It is the
<>most painful experience for them.
<NI>(28) {%Su1ci1mukham.%} Proud and miserly people who
<>refuse to spend money even for the bare necessities of
<>life, find their place in this hell. Those who do not
<>repay the money they have borrowed, will also be cast
<>into this hell. Here, their bodies will be continually
<>pricked and pierced with needles. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>8th Skandha; Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 2, Chapter 6).

<NI>13) {%Yama Defeated by Ra1van2a.%} Once the sage Na1rada
<>went to Ra1van2a and expatiated on the glory and splen-
<>dour of Yama. Immediately Ra1van2a set out to Sam3ya-
<>mani1 with the intention of subduing Yama. Accepting
<>Ra1van2a's challenge, Yama came out. After a terrible
<>battle between them, which lasted for seven days neither
<>of them was able to defeat the other. Both of them
<>had received Brahma1's boon. In the night of the
<>seventh day, Yama rushed forth with his staff to beat
<>Ra1van2a to death. Then Ra1van2a took his Brahma1stra.
<>At that critical moment, Brahma1 came to the battle-
<>field and persuaded Yama to withdraw from the fight.
<>Yama retreated to his city and closed the gate.
<>Ra1van2a went back with a triumphant shout. (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>The Devas all joined together and approached Yama
<>with a request to solve the problem. Yama concluded
<>his ya1ga and resumed his duties and death came to
<>the world again. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 199).
<HI>KA1LA II. A Mahars2i. Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 7, Verse 14, refers to this sage as offering
<>worship to Indra, in Indra's assembly.
<HI>KA1LA1. A daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. (See under Ka1lika1).
<HI>KA1LA. See under the word Ka1lama1na.
<HI>KALA (S) A group of Manes. This group lives in the
<>Brahmasabha1. (Chapter 11, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>KA1LABANDHAKA. An adviser of Mahis2a1sura.
<>Ciks2ura was his war-minister, Ta1mra his finance
<>minister, Asiloman, Prime Minister, and Udarka, Chief
<>of the army. Ka1labandhaka, Ba1s2kala and Trinetra
<>were the advisers of Mahis2a1sura. (Devi1 Bha1gavata 5th
<>Skandha).
<HI>KA1LABHI1TI. A devotee of S4iva. As his father Ma1m3t2i
<>performed penance for the sake of a son for a thousand
<>years his wife conceived, but did not deliver. Ma1m3t2i
<>asked the child in his mother's womb why he did not
<>come out to which the latter replied that he did not
<>come out as he feared the Asura called Ka1lama1rga. (As
<>the child feared Ka1lama1rga it came to be called
<>Ka1labhi1ti). As advised by S4iva, Ma1m3t2i created in the
<>child knowledge about dharma, renunciation etc. and
<>thus made him conscious about higher knowledge. The
<>child came out of the mother's womb. In due course of
<>time Ka1labhi1ti took to the worship of S4iva, who blessed
<>him as follows: “Since you have outlived Ka1lama1rga,
<>in future you will become famous as Maha1ka1la.”
<>(Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>KA1LABRA1HMAN2A. A brahmin, who defeated Ka1la.
<>A great effulgence that emanated from his head two
<>hundred years after his continuous Japa (Chanting of
<>mantras) blocked the passage of sky-walkers (Devas)
<>and spread to the three worlds. When Brahma1 and [Page371-a+ 64]
<>others asked him to choose any boon, he said that he
<>wanted nothing but chanting the Lord's name and
<>mantras. Again, Brahma1 insisted on the brahmin's
<>choosing some boon or other, and then he removed
<>himself to the northern planes of the Hima1layas, where
<>also he continued chanting mantras. There too his efful-
<>gence became so powerful that Indra deputed celestial
<>women to obstruct his Japa, but they could do nothing
<>in the matter. Then Indra deputed Ka1la to end the
<>brahmin's life, but he failed in the attempt. Ultimately
<>King Iks2va1ku came to the brahmin and asked for half
<>the power he had earned by his tapas, which the
<>brahmin readily granted. And, Iks2va1ku became thus
<>famous all over the worlds. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Su1rya-
<>prabha1lambaka).
<HI>KA1LADA. An urban region in ancient India.
<>(Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9).
<HI>KA1LADANTAKA (KA1LADANTA). A serpent born in
<>Va1suki's dynasty. It was burnt to death at the ser-
<>pent yajn5a of Janamejaya. (A1di Parva, Chapter 57).
<HI>KA1LADVIJA. A serpent, which attained salvation. The
<>story of this na1ga, which was at first a S4u1dra is told in
<>chapter 16 of the Padma Pura1n2a as follows:--
<NI>Once upon a time there lived in Karavi1rapura a very
<>selfish S4u1dra called Ka1ladvija, who was sentenced by
<>Ka1la to live in hell for four Manvantaras. After living
<>in hell the whole of the period, he was born as a na1ga
<>and suffered much in the crevices of a stone. While
<>living thus, on an A1s4vina pu1rn2ima1 (Full moon day in
<>the month of A1s4vina), it threw out some fried paddy
<>and Kaud2i1 (shells) which fell before Vis2n2u. At once the
<>Lord redeemed it from all its sins, and on its death,
<>in due course, the attendants of Vis2n2u took him in a
<>divine chariot to the Lord.
<HI>KA1LAGHAT2A. A brahmin scholar in the Vedas. He was
<>a member of the assembly at the serpent yajn5a conducted
<>by Janamejaya. (A1di Parva, Chapter 53).
<HI>KALAHA1. Wife of a bra1hman2a named Bhiks2u who was
<>an inhabitant of the city of Saura1s2t2ra. This woman
<>used to do only just the opposite of what her husband
<>asked her to do and so Bhiks2u kept it a rule to ask her
<>to do the opposite of what he wanted her to do. But
<>one day he asked her to float the s4ra1ddha pin2d2a in the
<>river Gan3ga1, and she threw it in S4aucyaku1pa. As a
<>result of that she was born in a demoniac womb. But
<>Dharmadatta got her purified by the Dva1das4a1ks2ari1
<>mantra and giving her half the virtue accrued by him.
<>By virtue of this they were reborn as Das4aratha and
<>Kausalya1. (A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a, Sa1raka1n2d2a; Uttara-
<>khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a). See also under Dharmadatta.
<HI>KA1LAJN5A(S). A synonym of the Ka1lakeyas. (See
<>under Ka1lakeya).
<HI>KA1LAKA1 (KA1LIKA1). One of the daughters of Daks2a.
<>Kas4yapa married her. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 183 states that Ka1lakeya and Naraka1sura were
<>born to Ka1laka1 by Kas4yapa. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 14). In Maha1bha1rata Aran2ya
<>Parva, Chapter 174 we find that Ka1laka1 once received
<>from Brahma1, a boon that her sons would never be
<>killed.
<HI>KA1LAKA. An Asura born to Ka1lika1 by Kas4yapa.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 14).
<HI>KA1LAKAKS2A. A warrior of Skanda deva. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 69). [Page371-b+ 64]
<HI>KA1LAKA1KS2A. An Asura. He was killed by Garud2a.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<HI>KA1LAKA1MUKHA (KA1LAKA1MMUKA). A Ra1ks2asa.
<>He was the brother of Prahasta, Ra1van2a's Minister. (For
<>Genealogy, see under Prahasta). During S4ri1 Ra1ma's
<>life in the forest Ka1laka1mukha was also among Khara,
<>Du1s2an2a and others. The other eleven members of that
<>group were--S4yenaga1mi1, Pr2thugri1va, Yajn5as4atru, Vihan3-
<>gama, Durjaya, Karavi1ra1ks2a, Parus2a, Meghama1li1,
<>Maha1ma1li1, Sarpa1sya and Rudhira1s4ana. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, 26th Sarga).
<HI>KA1LAKANYA1. Daughter of Ka1la (Yama). (See under
<>Puran5jana).
<HI>KA1LAKAVR2KS2I1YA. An ancient Saint. During the
<>reign of the King Ks2emadars4in in the country of
<>Kosala, his subjects were put to great sufferings under
<>the misrule and corruption of his courtiers. At that time,
<>Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya who was a friend of Ks2emadars4in and a
<>reputed sage, came to Kosala with a caged crow. The
<>sage went about the country claiming to know Ka1ka-
<>vidya1” (Va1yasi1 vidya1) by which a crow could be made
<>to tell past events. Actually, the sage was going round
<>the country in order to gather first-hand information
<>about the corrupt practices of the King's men. After
<>acquiring knowledge of the exact state of affairs in the
<>country, Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya reached the palace. Under the
<>cloak of the crow's words he exposed some of the impro-
<>prieties of the King's Minister. Naturally, the Minister
<>was furious and by his secret instructions his servants
<>shot the crow to death that same night. On the next
<>day, the sage himself went to the King and convinced
<>him of the Minister's guilt. The King accepted the
<>sage's suggestions and brought about a thorough over-
<>haul of the administration by punishing or dismissing
<>the culprits. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 82).
<NI>In Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 106 we find
<>that this sage once advised Drupada to make a treaty
<>with King Ks2emadars4in. Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya was a sage who
<>flourished in Indra's assembly. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 7).
<HI>KA1LAKETU. A renowned Asura Emperor who was the
<>son of Danu, the wife of Kas4yapa. Once he abducted
<>Eka1vali1, the wife of Ekavi1ra and went to Pa1ta1la (under-
<>world). Ekavi1ra fought a fierce battle with Ka1laketu
<>and recovered Eka1vali1. (See under Ekavi1ra).
<HI>KA1LAKEYA(S). (KA1LAKHAN5JAS).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The Asuras who were born to Ka1la1 (Ka1lika1)
<>by Kas4yapa Praja1pati, the son of Mari1ci and Brahma1's
<>grandson.
<NI>2) {%General.%} “Ka1lakeya” is not the proper name of
<>a particular Asura. The sons of Ka1la1 (Ka1lika1) are all
<>collectively called Ka1lakeyas. They number about
<>60,000. Sometimes they fought under the leadership of
<>Vr2tra1sura and at other times under other Asura
<>leaders.
<NI>3) {%Agastya and the Ka1lakeyas.%} Once the Ka1lakeyas
<>started a campaign of hatred against Bra1hman2as. At
<>nightfall they used to enter Bra1hman2a premises and
<>commit murders, disturb their ya1gas, etc. The Bra1hman2as
<>complained to the sage Agastya. Agastya set out to
<>capture the Ka1lakeyas, who were alarmed and hid
<>themselves in the ocean. Agastya dried up the ocean by
<>drinking it. But some of the Ka1lakeyas escaped and
<>fled to Pa1ta1la. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101). [Page372-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%Arjuna and the Ka1lakeyas.%} The headquarters of the
<>Asuras was Hiran2yapura, situated near Devaloka. Once
<>they allied themselves with thousands of other Asuras
<>called “Niva1takavacas” and launched an attack on
<>Devaloka. Indra sent his charioteer Ma1tali and brought
<>Arjuna to Devaloka. Arjuna defeated the Niva1takavacas
<>and Ka1lakeyas in battle. A large number of Ka1lakeyas
<>were killed in the battle. (M.B. Vana Parva Chapters
<>172-175).
<HI>KA1LAKI1RTI. A Ks2atriya King. Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 67 says that this King was born from
<>the limb of Suparn2a, the younger brother of the Asura,
<>Mayu1ra.
<HI>KA1LAKOT2I. A sacred place in Naimis2a1ran2ya. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 3).
<HI>KA1LAKU1T2A. The virulent poison that came up
<>during the churning of the Ocean of Milk. S4iva swallow-
<>ed and retained it in his throat, and so he came to
<>be called Ni1lakan2t2ha.
<NI>“And Ka1laku1t2a arose like fire burning all the worlds.
<>The smell of it sent the three worlds into a swoon.
<>At the request of Brahma1 S4iva swallowed the poison to
<>save the world from absolute destruction. And, he
<>(S4iva) retained it in his throat”. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 18).

<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 9th Skandha).
<NI>The ‘Ka1lama1na’ according to the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>differs in certain respects from the calculations given
<>above. Chapter 3, Part 1 of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a says:-- [Page372-b+ 65]
<>Fifteen Nimis2as make one Ka1s2t2ha1. Thirty Ka1s2t2ha1s
<>make one Kala1 and thirty Kala1s make one Muhu1rta.
<>Thirty Muhu1rtas make one day (man's) and thirty
<>such days, divided into two fortnights form a Ma1sa
<>(month). Six months form an Ayana; there are two
<>ayanas called Daks2in2a and Uttara. Daks2in2a1yana is
<>night, and Uttara1yan2a is day for the Devas. 12,000
<>Divyavars2as--Deva vars2as--form a Caturyuga consisting
<>of the Kr2ta--Treta1--Dva1para and Kali yugas, con-
<>sisting respectively of 4000, 3000, 2000 and 1000
<>Divyavars2as. Before the commencement and after the
<>end of every one of the above four yugas there is an
<>interval respectively of 400, 300, 200, and 100 years.
<>The interval before the commencement is called
<>Sandhya1 and that at the end is called Sandhya1m3s4a. The
<>period between Sandhya1 and Sandhhya1m3s4a is called Kr2ta
<>yuga etc. One thousand Caturyugas form one day for
<>Brahma1, and it (Brahma1's one day) has 14 Manus.
<NI>Again, Chapter 8, Part 2 of the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a has the
<>following to say about Ka1lama1na.
<NI>Fifteen nimisas make one Ka1s2t2ha1, thirty Ka1s2t2ha1s one
<>Kala1, thirty Kala1s one muhu1rta and thirty muhu1rtas
<>one day and night. Day is long or short according to
<>the length or shortness of parts of the day, like morning,
<>noon and evening. Despite the above variation evening
<>or dusk time is always (2 na1zhika1s) the same. The
<>three muhu1rtas from the sun's ardhodaya (when half
<>of the sun has arisen) is called Pra1tah2ka1la, (morning)
<>and it is (1/5)th of day time. The three muhu1rtas
<>following are known as sam3gava. Madhya1hna (noon)
<>is the three muhu1rtas after sam3gava. The time after
<>madhya1hna is apara1hna (afternoon). Apara1hna lasts
<>for three muhu1rtas. The time after this is dusk. Thus,
<>a day-time of fifteen muhu1rtas is divided into five parts
<>of three muhu1rtas each. On Vis2uvat day the day will
<>have full fifteen muhu1rtas. Then during Uttara1yan2a
<>and Daks2in2a1yana the day will be longer or shorter.
<>During Uttara1yan2a the day will be longer than night,
<>and during Daks2in2a1yana vice versa. Vis2uvat occurs
<>when the sun enters the Tula1 (Libra) and Mes2a (Aries)
<>houses. Daks2in2a1yana is when the sun enters Cancer,
<>and Uttara1yana when it enters Capricorn.
<NI>Fifteen days and nights constitute a Paks2a (fortnight)
<>and two Paks2as one month. Two solar months consti-
<>tute a R2tu (season), three r2tus one ayana and two
<>ayanas one year. Since there are four kinds of months,
<>i.e. Saura, Sa1vana, Ca1ndra and Na1ks2atra, years are
<>considered to be of five different kinds. The first is called
<>Sam3vatsara; the second parivatsara; the third id2vatsara;
<>the fourth, anuvatsara and the fifth, vatsara. This

<>wards Da1s4a1rha, King of Mathura1, married her. The
<>King felt very hot whenever he approached her and
<>he questioned her about it. She said she had received
<>the Pan5ca1ks2ara Mantra even from childhood and
<>sinners would feel the heat if they touched her. The
<>King was greatly disappointed and Kala1vati1 took him
<>to Sage Garga to redeem him from all his sins. The
<>sage dipped the King in the river Ka1lindi1 and when
<>the King rose up all his sins flew away from his body as
<>tiny birds. The King reaching the palace, embraced

<>sis2t2ha, Cyavana and Bharadva1ja. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 102). Devas killed some of the Ka1leyas; the others
<>ran away to Pa1ta1la.
<HI>KALI I. Incarnation of sin, the Sin-god.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapapraja1pati, son of Brahma1, begot of
<>his wife Muni sixteen sons and Kali was the fifteenth

<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Gopati, Suvarcas, Satyava1k, Arkaparn2a,
<>Prayuta, Vis4ruta, Citraratha, S4a1lis4iras, Parjanya and
<>Na1rada. (4 S4lokas from verse 43, Chapter 65, A1di
<>Parva).
<NI>2) {%How Pari1ks2it controlled Kali.%} When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went to
<>Vaikun2t2ha, the Pa1n2d2avas entrusted the administration
<>of the state to Pari1ks2it, son of Abhimanyu and started
<>for the Maha1prastha1na. King Pari1ks2it was travelling
<>the continent conquering places when he saw Kali in
<>the garb of a S4u1dra King teasing a cow and bull
<>couple. Pari1ks2it aimed an arrow at him and then Kali
<>came and bowed down before the King. The King did
<>not kill him. He let him go free but ordered him to go
<>away from his state. Kali was nonplussed because all
<>the land belonged to Pari1ks2it and there was no place
<>for him to go. So Kali begged of the King to give him
<>some space to live. Pari1ks2it then declared that Kali
<>could live in the following five places: Gambling’
<>Drinking, Woman, Murder and Gold. From that day
<>onwards the free movements of Kali were thus restricted
<>(Chapter 17, 1st Skandha, Bha1gavata). [Page374-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Kali, Lord of Kaliyuga.%} There are fourteen Man-
<>vantaras during the life of Brahma1. The life time of a
<>Manu is a Manvantara. This present period is the
<>seventh Manvantara. In each Manvantara there are
<>four yugas, Kr2ta, Treta1, Dva1para and Kali. Kr2tayuga
<>consists of 17,28000 years, Treta1yuga consists of 12,-
<>96000 years, Dva1parayuga 8,64000 years and Kaliyuga
<>4,32,000 years. The christian era started in the Kali
<>era 3102 and after another 4,26926 years Kaliyuga will
<>come to an end and the present universe will enter
<>the eighth Manvantara. From the beginning of the
<>Kaliyuga acts of sin predominate and Kali, sin-god,
<>will lord over the world.
<NI>Kali was born on the day S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a ascended heaven.
<>When Bhagava1n Mukunda abandoned his body and
<>went to his place in Vaikun2t2ha. Kali came into being
<>binding all on earth. (S4loka 66, Chapter 1, Bha1gavata
<>Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>4) {%Kali and Nala.%} Kali and Dva1para were going to
<>the Svayam3vara of Damayanti1 when they met Indra
<>and others returning from the Svayam3vara. They told
<>Kali and Dva1para that Damayanti1 was married to Nala.
<>Kali and Dva1para felt it an outrage that Damayanti1
<>should have married a man of the earth and not a deva.
<>Kali decided that Nala should be sent out of his
<>country and his matrimonial life made most unhappy.
<>Dva1para consented to be his accomplice in this attempt.
<>Kali followed Nala waiting for an opportunity to enter
<>his body. One day, by an oversight Nala, without doing
<>the a1camana after passing urine, performed his sandhya1-
<>vandana. Taking that opportunity Kali entered the
<>body of Nala. Kali went to Pus2kara, brother of Nala in
<>the guise of a bullock and made Nala challenge his bro-
<>ther to a game of dice putting that bullock as a wager.
<>Pus2kara accepted the challenge. Nala wagered and lost
<>all his movable and immovable possessions and went to
<>the forests with Damayanti1. Nala, prompted by Kali,
<>abandoned Damayanti1 in the forests and went his way.
<>Damayanti1 cursed Kali.
<NI>It was at this time that the great serpent Karkot2aka was
<>entrapped in a wild fire. Nala saved him from the fire
<>but in return the cobra bit him turning Nala into one
<>of blue hue and said “Oh Nala, let Kali who cheat-
<>ed you and is now inside your body suffer with the
<>poison I have injected into your body.”
<NI>Nala roamed about and reached Ayodhya1 and there
<>became the charioteer of R2tuparn2a, King of Ayodhya1.
<>When R2tuparn2a went to the second marriage of
<>Damayanti1 to Vidarbha, Nala went with him as his
<>charioteer. On the way Nala taught R2tuparn2a the
<>science of As4vahr2daya and R2tuparn2a in return
<>taught him the science of Aks2ahr2daya. When Nala
<>learnt the secret of Aks2ahr2daya he vomited all the poison
<>inside him and Kali left him. Nala was about to curse
<>Kali but refrained from it at the request of Kali. At
<>once Kali climbed on a Ta1nni tree (Beleric Myro-
<>balan) and went down from the tree when Nala left
<>the place. Ta1nni is from that day onwards considered
<>a cursed tree. (Chapter 58, Vana Parva).
<NI>5) {%The world in Kaliyuga.%} The celebrated sage Ma1r-
<>kan2d2eya had prophesied about the happenings in Kali-
<>yuga thus: In Kaliyuga all will be dishonest. Charity
<>and Sacrifices will be only for a name. Bra1hman2as
<>would do the duties of S4u1dras. S4u1dras will become
<>prosperous. There will be sinners as kings. People will [Page374-b+ 65]
<>be short-lived and the stature of the people also will
<>diminish. Beastly type of men will be on the increase.
<>Taste and smell will vanish. Women will be ‘Mukhe-
<>bhaga1s’. Men will sell rice and bra1hman2as, the Vedas.
<>Women will sell their vaginas. The yield of milk from
<>cows will decrease. Flowers and fruits will become less.
<>Crows will be on the increase. Bra1hman2as would become
<>beggars. Sages will be merchants. Bra1hman2as would
<>without any reason grow hairs and nails. None will
<>observe the four a1s4ramas correctly. Students will defile
<>the bed of their preceptors. Rains will be in and out of
<>season. Trees and plants will refuse to grow in many
<>places. There will be murder of people everywhere.
<>Merchants will be cheats and they will use false mea-
<>sures. Righteous persons will decrease and sinners will
<>increase. Girls of seven or eight years will become
<>pregnant and boys will become fathers. Young men at
<>the age of sixteen would be grey-haired. Old men will
<>continue practising the habits of young men. Wives
<>will lie with their servants. Wives will be prostitutes
<>even while their husbands are alive. People will die in
<>lots of hunger.” (Chapter 188. Vana Parva).
<NI>6) {%Kaliyugati1rtha.%} The greatest ti1rtha of Kaliyuga is
<>the river Gan3ga1. (Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<NI>7) {%Duryodhana was the incarnation of Kali and S4akuni, that%}
<>of Dva1para. (Cha1pter 31, A1s4rama Parva).
<HI>KALI II. A synonym of Su1rya. (Sloka 20, Chapter 3,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>KALI III. A synonym of S4iva. (S4loka 79, Chapter 17,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>KA1LI1 I. A synonym of Satyavati1, mother of Vya1sa. (See
<>under Adrika1 and Satyavati1).
<HI>KA1LI1 II. An aspect or form of Pa1rvati1. (See under
<>Pa1rvati1).
<HI>KA1LIDA1SA. The greatest poet and dramatist in Sans-
<>krit. Some scholars opine that Ka1lida1sa flourished in
<>the 8th Century B.C. while others place his date upto
<>the period 11th Century A.D. At any rate most of the
<>scholars consider the period between 1st Century B.C.
<>and 5th Century A.D. as the most probable date of
<>the great poet. Some of the main theories in this regard
<>are as follows;--
<NI>(1) {%Eighth century B.C.%} Towards the close of Raghu-
<>vam3s4a Maha1ka1vya Ka1lida1sa has referred to the son of
<>King Agnimitra. Therefore the poet must have lived in
<>the 8th Century B.C. This is the view of the scholar
<>Hippolyte Fanche.
<NI>(2) {%Second Century B.C.%} According to Dr. Kun5jan
<>Ra1ja1 Ka1lida1sa lived in the second Century B.C., the
<>reasons for the belief being as follows. The poet was a
<>contemporary of King Agnimitra of the Sun3ga dynasty.
<>This Agnimitra is eulogised in Ka1lida1sa's Ma1lavika1gni-
<>mitra. Agnimitra is referred to in the Bharatava1kya
<>(epilogue) of the drama also.
<NI>(3) {%First Century B.C.%} The traditional belief is that
<>Ka1lida1sa was a member in the assembly of poets and
<>scholars of the court of emperor Vikrama1ditya, who
<>started the Vikrama era in B.C. 56.
<Poem>Dhanvantariks2apan2aka1marasim3ha-S4an3ku--

<>Khyato Vara1hamihiro nr2pateh2 sabha1ya1m3
<>Ratna1ni vai vararucir nava vikramasya.</Poem>
<NI>4) {%Fifth Century A.D.%} According to Dr. Keith, Ka1li-
<>da1sa lived in the fifth Century A.D. One Candra- [Page375-a+ 64]
<>gupta II, who defeated the S4akas in 339 A.D. was
<>King of Ujjain. He was known as Vikrama1ditya also.
<>Dr.Keith thinks that the great poet might have been
<>a member of this King's court. Perhaps Ka1lida1sa had
<>remembered his royal patron Vikrama1ditya in his
<>drama called Vikramorvas4i1ya. Dr. Keith is further of
<>the view that Ka1lida1sa composed Kuma1rasambhava
<>after attending the birth celebrations of Kuma1ragupta,
<>son of King Vikrama1ditya.
<NI>(5) {%Sixth Century A.D.%} Three scholars, Fergusson, Max
<>Muller and Kern have opined that Ka1lida1sa lived in
<>the sixth Century A.D.
<NI>Whichever be the date of Ka1lida1sa it could be known
<>from his works that he spent the major part of his life
<>in Ujjain, and was inextricably indebted to the city in
<>many ways. Raghuvam3s4a and Kuma1rasambhava are
<>his two maha1ka1vyas. He had also written three dramas,
<>Abhijn5a1nas4a1kuntala, Vikramorvas4i1ya and Ma1lavika1gni-
<>mitra and a lyric called R2tusam3ha1ra. He wrote also a
<>world-famous poem called Meghasandes4a.
<HI>KA1LIKA1. A female attendant of Skanda. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 46, Verse 14).
<HI>KA1LIKA. One of the attendants given to Skanda by

<>ter 45, Verse 43).
<HI>KA1LIKA1SAN3GA A holy place. Bathing here is as
<>good as that at Ka1lika1s4rama.
<HI>KA1LIKA1S4RAMA. A holy place. If one bathes and
<>spends three nights here one will be released from the

<>ter 25).
<HI>KA1LIKEYA. A son of King Subala. He was killed by
<>Abhimanyu. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 49).
<HI>KA1LINDI1 (YAMUNA1).
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ka1lindi1 alias Yamuna1 is one of the holy
<>rivers in India. The presiding deity of the river is
<>Ka1lindi1devi1. Ka1lindi1, the daughter of the sun has her
<>source in Kalinda mountain2, and hence the name
<>Ka1lindi1 for the river. Ka1lindi1 joins the Gan3ga1 at
<>Praya1ga, and this confluence of the two rivers is called
<>San3gama, which is a sacred place.
<NI>2) {%Gave way for S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} As soon as Kr2s2n2a was born
<>Vasudeva stealthily removed the child to Amba1d2i. Due
<>to heavy rains the Ka1lindi1 was overflowing, and Vasu-
<>deva begged Ka1lindi1 for a passage, and the river gave

<>stayed in Amba1d2i for two months. One day he was
<>picnicking on the banks of Ka1lindi1 with the Gopi1s.
<>Under the influence of liquor he desired to play with
<>his companions in the waters of Ka1lindi1. He called
<>Ka1lindi1 to his side, but the chaste Ka1lindi1 refused to
<>oblige him. So he dragged her by his plough hooking
<>her to it. In great fear Ka1lindi1 saluted him, and he
<>enjoyed with the gopi1s for some time on its waters.
<>(Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>4) {%Ka1lindi1, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's wife.%} After Maya had built
<>Indraprastha for the Pa1n2d2avas, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a spent a few
<>days there with them. And, one day while Kr2s2n2a and
<>Arjuna were strolling on the banks of Ka1lindi1 the latter
<>saw there a beautiful woman performing penance and
<>he approached her. She told Arjuna that the object
<>of her penance was to get Kr2s2n2a as husband, and when [Page375-b+ 64]
<>Arjuna passed on the information to Kr2s2n2a he took her

<>Jara1sandha and the son of his minister, Ham3sa, being
<>told that his father had been killed, committed suicide
<>by jumping into Ka1lindi1. But, Ham3sa had not been
<>killed, and when he returned from the battlefield and
<>knew about the death of his son, he too jumped into
<>Ka1lindi1 and committed suicide. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 14).
<NI>7). {%Other information.%}

<HI>KA1LIYA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci begot of his wife Kadru1 powerful na1gas like
<>S4es2a, Aira1vata, Taks2aka, Ka1rkot2aka, Ka1liya, Man2i-
<>na1ga, Pura1n2ana1ga etc. and from them were born all
<>kinds of na1gas on earth. (A1di Parva, Chapter 35).
<>Ka1liya possessed one thousand heads. (Bha1gavata,
<>10th Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Ka1liya taok his abode in Ka1lindi1.%} Vinata1 and Kadru1
<>were wives of Kas4yapa. The former was the mother
<>of Garud2a and the latter of the na1gas. In a wager
<>Vinata1 was defeated and had to become the slave of
<>Kadru1. Garud2a brought Amr2ta from Devaloka and
<>redeemed his mother from slavery. Yet Garud2a and
<>the na1gas continued to be enemies, Garud2a killing and
<>eating na1gas whenever he got a chance for it. At last the
<>na1gas entered into an understanding with Garud2a
<>agreeing to give him the havis (offering) which they
<>got on certain days, and thus Garud2a stopped eating
<>the na1gas. But Ka1liya did not subscribe to the above
<>agreement; he treated Garud2a with contempt. But, in
<>an encounter with Garud2a Ka1liya was put to so much
<>of hardships that he, along with his family, shifted his
<>residence to a particular sector in Ka1lindi1.
<NI>3) {%Admission denied to Garud2a.%} Owing to the curse of
<>a sage called Saubhari, who was performing penance on
<>the banks of Ka1lindi1, that Garud2a would die broken-
<>headed if he entered Ka1lindi1, it was a prohibited area
<>to Garud2a.
<NI>4) {%Suppression of Ka1liya.%} Owing to the virulent poison
<>of Ka1liya the waters of Ka1lindi1 became poisonous and
<>the trees on its banks dried up. Once, while Kr2s2n2a
<>and his companions, the Gopa1las came to the banks of
<>the river grazing their cows. The Gopa1las drank water
<>from the river and fell down dead. Then Kr2s2n2a jump-
<>ed into the river from the top of a tree on its bank and
<>danced upon the hoods of Ka1liya who had rushed to [Page376-b+ 65]
<>attack him. Ka1liya vomited blood and saluted Kr2s2n2a.
<>His wives and children also saluted the Lord. Kr2s2n2a
<>sent all of them away to Raman2aka island assuring
<>Ka1liya that Garud2a would not attack him on seeing the
<>marks of his (Kr2s2n2a's) feet on Ka1liya. Thus did
<>Ka1liya and his family shift their residence to Rama-
<>n2aka island. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<HI>KALIYUGA. See under Manvantara.
<HI>KALKI. The tenth avata1ra (incarnation) of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. The ten avata1ras are called Das4a1vata1ras.
<>Kalki is the last of them. Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 16
<>says as follows about the incarnation of Kalki:--
<NI>Towards the end of Kaliyuga, all people will lose their
<>faith in God and become irreligious. They will accept
<>presents from the wicked. At that time, there will be
<>intermixture of castes. People will become thieves and
<>evil doers. Fifteen divisions of the Veda Va1jasaneya
<>alone will become the authoritative document. People,
<>wearing the garb of righteousness, will indulge in
<>unrighteousness. Mlecchas (lowest class of people)
<>assuming the form of Kings will begin feeding upon
<>human beings. At that time Lord Vis2n2u will incarnate
<>as Kalki, the son of Vis2n2uyas4as and the priest of
<>Ya1jn5avalkya and exterminate all mlecchas. He will
<>restore people to ca1turvarn2ya and the four a1s4ramas and
<>maintain proper standards of conduct. Afterwards the
<>Lord will renounce the form of Kalki and ascend
<>Heaven. Then Kr2tayuga will begin again.
<NI>Chapter 190 of Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata supports almost all the
<>above statements. In the light of them, we can gather cer-
<>tain features of Kalki's incarnation when Kaliyuga reaches
<>its zenith. Maha1vis2n2u will be born as a Bra1hman2a with
<>the name Vis2n2uyas4as, in the village called S4a1mbhala.
<>Vis2n2uyas4as2 will become famous under the name Kalki.
<>He will be the priest of Ya1jn5avalkya. He will create arms
<>and soldiers by his will itself and destroy the wicked.
<>With that Kr2tayuga will commence.
<NI>There is difference of opinion as to whether Kalki's
<>incarnation has passed or is yet to come. But in the
<>light of the statements in the Pura1n2as, Kalki has not
<>yet come. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, says that
<>Kaliyuga extends over a period of 4, 32, 000 years.
<>It is now only a little over 5,000 years since it began.
<>Still, more than 4, 26, 900 years have to pass before
<>the end of Kaliyuga. Therefore lakhs of years have
<>still to pass before the incarnation of Kalki.
<HI>KALMA1S2A1N3GHRI. See under the word KALMA1S2A-

<HI>KALMA1S2APA1DA. (KALMA1S2A1N3GHRI, MITRASAHA,
<>SAUDA1SA). A famous king of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<>He wandered about in the forest as a Ra1ks2asa for twelve
<>years.

<>Suda1sa (Sudha1s4ana)--Mitrasaha (Kalma1s2apa1da).
<NI>2) {%Name.%} His actual name was Mitrasaha. Since he
<>was the son of Suda1sa, he was called Sauda1sa also. [Page377-a+ 64]
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 78). Kalma1s2a1n3ghri
<>and Kalma1s2apa1da were names which he got as a result
<>of Vasis2t2ha's curse.
<NI>3) {%Mitrasaha became a Ra1ks2asa.%} Mitrasaha was a re-
<>puted and glorious king belonging to the solar dynasty
<>of kings who ruled over Ayodhya1. He had a queen
<>named Madayanti1. While they were leading a happy
<>and enviable married life, Mitrasaha was forced to
<>lead the life of a Ra1ks2asa in the forest for a period of
<>12 years, as the result of a curse. The story of this
<>curse is given in different Pura1n2as in different versions
<>and they are given below;--
<NI>4) {%S4akti Cursed Mitrasaha.%} One day Mitrasaha went to
<>the forest for hunting. Vis4va1mitra wished to get this
<>mighty King as his disciple. While the King was
<>passing through the forest, he saw S4akti, Vasis2t2ha's son,
<>coming towards him. The King was a Ks2atriya and
<>S4akti was a Bra1hman2a. They were faced with the
<>problem of whether the Ks2atriya should make way for
<>the Bra1hman2a or vice versa. Neither of them made way
<>for the other. At last, Mitrasaha struck Sakti with his
<>whip. In his anger S4akti cursed Mitrasaha that he
<>should become a Ra1ks2asa and roam about in the forest
<>for 16 years. Vis4va1mitra who was standing nearby at
<>the time introduced a devil into the body of the King
<>and from that day Mitrasaha wandered about in the
<>forest in the form of a Ra1ks2asa. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 176).
<NI>5) {%Vasis2t2h cursed Mitrasaha.%} Mitrasaha once went to hunt
<>in the forest. While hunting he came across two tiger
<>cubs. Actually, they were two Ra1ks2asas in disguise.
<>The King who was unaware of it, killed one of them
<>with an arrow. The other cub suddenly assumed his
<>own form as a Ra1ks2asa and after giving Mitrasaha a
<>warning that he would take revenge on him at the
<>proper time, vanished.
<NI>After the hunt the King returned to his palace. He
<>informed Vasis2t2ha that he wished to perform As4va-
<>medhaya1ga like his ancestors. The sage offered to assist
<>him in it. Shortly after, one day, the old Ra1ks2asa-tiger,
<>disguising himself as the sage Vasis2t2ha, came to Mitra-
<>saha and said;-- “Oh King! I will tell you a secret.
<>Don't tell anyone else. I have a great desire to eat
<>meat food. Please send some cooked meat to my A1s4rama
<>without anyone knowing about it.” After saying this,
<>the disguised Ra1ks2asa-sage left the place.
<NI>The King told this secret to his wife Madayanti1. They
<>prepared the meat-food secretly and took it to Vasis2t2ha's
<>A1s4rama. When Vasis2t2ha saw the meat food, he took it
<>as a personal insult and transformed the King into a
<>Ra1ks2asa. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>6) {%Another story of Vasis2t2ha's curse on Mitrasah.%} Once
<>while Mitrasaha was hunting in the forest, he happened
<>to kill a Ra1ks2asa by accident. The dead Ra1ks2asa's
<>younger brother swore to avenge his death. He went to
<>the King in the disguise of a young Bra1hman2a cook.
<>Mitrasaha appointed him as a cook in the royal
<>kitchen.
<NI>At about that time, one day, Vasis2t2ha came to Ayodhya1,
<>on the invitation of Mitrasaha for a S4ra1ddha. Mitra-
<>saha, accompanied by his queen, greeted the sage with
<>honour. He ordered the cook to prepare food for the
<>guest at once. The Ra1ksasa disguised as cook, decided
<>to make the best of this opportunity. In a short time [Page377-b+ 64]
<>he cooked some human flesh and offered it as food for
<>Vasis2t2ha. The enraged sage cursed the King to become
<>a man-eating Ra1ks2asa who would roam about for twelve
<>years in the woods. Thus Mitrasaha became a Ra1ks2asa.
<>(S4iva Pura1n2a, S4ivara1tri Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>7) {%How Mitrasaha got the name “Kalma1s2apa1da.”%} Mitra-
<>saha became very angry whan he was cursed by
<>Vasis2t2ha. He decided to pay back in the same coin by
<>cursing Vasis2t2ha also. He took water in his hand and
<>was about to throw it down with the words of curse.
<>But his queen Madayanti1 stopped him. She reminded
<>him that it was not right to curse a Bra1hman2a and
<>requested him to sprinkle that water on his own feet.
<>The King's anger cooled down and he sprinkled the
<>water on his own feet. Since his feet were polluted by
<>the water of sin Mitrasaha came to be called “Kalma1-
<>s2apa1da”, and Kalma1s2a1n3ghri” from that day. (S4iva
<>Pura1n2a, S4ivara1tri Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>8) {%Kalma1s2apa1da's life as Ra1ks2asa.%} The curse-ridden
<>Kanma1s2apa1da began to look upon Vasis2t2ha and his
<>sons with inveterate hatred. He roamed the country-
<>sides and forests in the form of a Ra1ks2asa. He started
<>man-eating by feeding upon S4akti, the eldest son of
<>Vasis2t2ha. After that he ate all the remaining 99 sons
<>of Vasis2t2ha. Distreseed2 at the loss of his children,
<>Vasis2t2ha left his A1srama, bent on committing suicide.
<>He tied his own hands and feet securely with a rope and
<>jumped into the river to drown himself. This attempt,
<>like several other attempts to commit suicide, failed
<>and he did not die. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 177).
<>In the Maha1bha1rata there is a story which says that
<>once Uttan3ka, a disciple of the sage Gautama went to
<>beg the Kun2d2alas (ear ornaments) worn by Kanma1s2a-
<>pa1da's (Sauda1sa's) queen, for the sake of Gautama's
<>wife. (For details, see under the word “Uttan3ka”).
<NI>9) {%Bra1hman2i1's curse on Kalma1s2apa1da.%} In the course of
<>his wanderings through the forest as a Ra1ks2asa, Kalma1-
<>s2apa1da happened to come across a Bra1hman2a youth
<>engaged in amorous pleasures with his wife A1n3girasi1.
<>The King caught hold of the youth and killed him. His
<>wife, the Bra1hman2i1 wept loudly and after cremating her
<>husband's body in a funeral pyre, jumped into it and
<>burnt herself to death. Just before her death she pro-
<>nounced a curse on Kalma1s2apa1da that if he touched
<>any woman in future he would die immediately.
<NI>After the death of the Bra1hman2a couple, the sin of
<>Brahmahatya1 (killing of Bra1hman2a) continued to pur-
<>sue Kalma1s2apa1da in the form of a terrible monster.
<>He fled for life from it and at last reached the pre-
<>sence of King Janaka. There, he happened to see the
<>sage Gautama who taught Kalma1s2apa1da Divyajn5ana
<>(Divine wisdom). As advised by the sage, he went to
<>the temple at Gokarn2a and spent some years in deep
<>meditation. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4ivara1tri Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>10) {%S4a1pamoks2a. (Liberation from Curse).%} Towards the
<>close of the twelve years which Mitrasha (Kalma1s2a-
<>pa1da) spent as a Ra1ks2asa, Vasis2t2ha saw him. The sage
<>sprinkled holy water on Mitrasha and at once the
<>Ra1ks2asa (the spirit of the Ra1ks2asa) left his body and he
<>resumed his original figure of the King. He accepted
<>Vasis2t2ha as his preceptor. They went back together to
<>Ayodhya1.
<NI>Although Madayanti1, queen of Mitrasaha was there, the
<>King was not able to touch her owing to the Bra1hman2i1's [Page378-a+ 64]
<>curse. So he requested Vasis2t2ha to beget children by
<>her. Accordingly Madayanti1 became pregnant by
<>Vasis2t2ha. But she did not deliver the child even after
<>twelve years. At last she hit the embryo in her womb
<>with a stone and the child was born. Since he was born
<>with the help of a stone (As4man), the child was named
<>“A maka”. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 167).
<HI>KALMA1S2I1. A river. It was while travelling by the side
<>of this river, that King Drupada reached a Bra1hman2a
<>village where he happened to meet Upaya1ja. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 166). Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 78, Verse 16 says that it was on the bank of
<>this river that the sage Bhr2gu blessed Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(Modern scholars believe that Kanma1s2i1. is the same as
<>the present river Yamuna1).
<HI>KA1LODAKA. A sacred place. The sin of causing
<>abortion of those who bathe in the ti1rtha here will be
<>washed away. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse
<>60 and S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 152, Verse 12).
<HI>KALPA I. A son of Dhruva. See under DHRUVA.
<HI>KALPA II. A period of one thousand Yugas or fourteen
<>Manvantaras. See under MANVANTARA.
<HI>KALPA III. The customary proceedings of Ya1gas.
<>These proceedings are made in the form of Su1tras. The
<>Su1tras describe how the Bra1hman2as and mantras are
<>to be used. For each Sam3hita1 there are separate
<>S4rauta Su1tras. The S4rauta Su1tras for R2gveda Sam3hita1
<>are A1s4vala1yana, S4a1m3kha1yana and S4aunaka. Those for
<>Sa1maveda are Mas4aka, La1t2ya1yana and Dra1hya1yan2a.
<>Those for Kr2s2n2a Yajurveda are A1pastamba Bauddha1-
<>yana, Satya1s2a1d2ha, Hiran2yakes4i1, Ma1nava, Bha1radva1ja,
<>Va1dhu1la, Vaikha1nasa, Lauga1ks2i, Maitra, Kat2ha and
<>Va1ra1ha. For S4uklayajurveda it is Ka1tya1yana Srauta
<>Su1tra. For Atharvaveda it is Kaus4ika S4rauta Su1tra.
<>All these Su1tras contain only brief symbolic words and
<>are difficult to understand without explanation.
<HI>KALPAKA. S4iva's garden. It is situated in Kaila1sa.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2hakalambaka, Part I).
<HI>KALPAVR2KS2A. A tree in Devaloka. It has the
<>power of giving any object that one wishes to get.
<>There are five Kalpavr2ks2as in Devaloka. Their names
<>are: Manda1ra, Pa1rija1ta, Santa1na, Kalpavr2ks2a and
<>Haricandana.
<NI>Agni Pura1n2a, third Chapter mentions that among the
<>wonderful things obtained by the churning of the
<>ocean of milk, there was Kalpavr2ks2a also. So Kalpa-
<>vr2ks2a was born from the ocean of milk.
<HI>KA1LYA1 (KA1LI1). Mother of Vya1sa. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 278).
<HI>KALYA1N2A. A sage. Once certain An3girases including
<>this sage observed sattra (sacrifice) for the attainment
<>of Heaven. But nobody was sure about the Devaya1na
<>path which leads to Heaven. So they selected Kalya1n2a
<>to find out the path. He went in search of the
<>Devaya1na path and on the way he met U1rn2a1yu, a
<>Gandharva who was in the company of some apsara1
<>women. The gandharva disclosed the Sa1ma which
<>would enable Kalya1n2a to find out the Devaya1na path.
<>On his return, Kalya1n2a told the other R2s2is that he
<>had received the Sa1ma, but he refused to disclose from
<>whom he obtained it. With the help of that Sa1ma
<>known as Aurn2a1yuva, the An3girases attained Heaven,
<>but because of his failure to disclose the whole truth,
<>Kalya1n2a was denied access to Heaven. Besides that, [Page378-b+ 64]
<>he became a victim to the disease of leprosy. (Pan5ca-
<>vim3s4a Bra1hman2am).
<HI>KALYA1N2I1. A female follower of Skandadeva. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 6).
<HI>KA1MA I. God of beauty in Indian mythology.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A Praja1pati named Dharma was born
<>from the right breast of Brahma1. Dharma was very
<>handsome. Three sons, S4ama, Ka1ma and Hars2a who
<>were exceedingly handsome, were born to him. Of
<>them, Ka1ma became the god of beauty. His wife was
<>Rati. S4ama became the husband of Pra1pti. Hars2a had
<>Nanda1 for his wife. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verses 31-33).
<NI>In Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a we see another story about Ka1ma's
<>birth. Brahma1 created ten Praja1patis. After that, the
<>woman Sandhya1 was created. At the very moment of
<>her birth, Brahma1 and the Praja1patis were irresistibly
<>fascinated by her charm and they sprang up from
<>their seats. All their thoughts converged on the same
<>object. At this time a handsome youth emerged from
<>Brahma1's mind with a floral bow in his hands.
<>Immediately after his birth, he asked Brahma1 “Kam3
<>darpaya1mi” (Whom should I make proud?) Brahma1
<>replied--Let the minds of living beings be the aim of
<>your arrows”. He suggested Rati the daughter of
<>Daks2a, to be Ka1ma's wife. Since he stirred the mind
<>of Brahma1, he got the name “MANMATHA”, and
<>since he was extremely attractive in appearance he
<>came to be called “KA1MA”. (For further details, see
<>under “RATI.”)
<NI>2) {%How Ka1madeva got the name “KANDARPA”.%} As soon
<>as Ka1ma was born, he went to Brahma1 and asked him
<>“Kam3 darpaya1mi?” (Whom should I make proud?).
<>Therefore he got the name “KANDARPA”. (Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara).
<NI>3) {%Brahma1 cursed Ka1ma.%} Once Brahma1 was meditating
<>upon Para Brahman for the purpose of creation. He
<>felt carnal thoughts rising in his mind. At once a girl
<>was born from his mind. She appeared before him and
<>did obeisance to him. This girl was Sarasvati1. Brahma1
<>fell in love with her. He declared that she should stay
<>in the tongues of all living beings, and particularly at
<>the tip of the tongues of all scholars. After that he
<>made Sarasvati1 his wife. Soon he felt repentant for his
<>weakness of mind. His anger blazed at Ka1ma who was
<>the cause of all this. He cursed that Ka1ma would be
<>burnt to ashes in the fire from S4iva's third eye. After
<>that Brahma1 gave his carnal desire to the great sage
<>Atri who transferred it to his wife Anasu1ya1. It hardened
<>itself within her and took the form of Candra, who
<>was thus born to her. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>43).
<NI>4) {%Ka1ma was burnt up in fire.%} Long ago an Asura
<>named Ta1raka, who was proud of his invincible might,
<>was causing much havoc and terror in the whole world.
<>Even the gods were afraid of him because he had received
<>a boon that S4iva's son alone was capable of killing him.
<>It was the time when Pa1rvati1, the daughter of Himava1n,
<>was performing a penance praying that Parames4vara
<>should become her husband. Taking advantage of this
<>opportunity, Indra sent Ka1ma to rouse the passion of
<>love in S4iva's mind. Ka1ma reached S4iva's seat and
<>tried to stir up his passions. S4iva who was enraged at
<>this, opened his third eye blazing with fire. Ka1ma was. [Page379-a+ 63]
<>burnt to ashes in that fire. The place where Ka1ma's
<>body (An3ga) fell, came to be called “An3gara1jya”. Since
<>he lost his body, Ka1madeva got another name
<>“Anan3ga”. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 23).
<NI>5) {%Ka1ma's Next Birth.%} When S4iva burnt up Ka1ma,
<>the latter's wife Rati prayed to S4iva to restore her hus-
<>band to life. S4iva was pleased and said that Rati would
<>be born in the world and Ka1ma would take birth as
<>her son.” (Katha1saritsa1gara).
<NI>According to S4iva's blessing Rati was born in the world
<>under the name of Ma1ya1vati1. She became the kitchen-
<>maid of an Asura named S4ambara. At that time S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a approached S4iva with a request that he should
<>be blessed with a son. S4iva blessed him saying that
<>Ka1ma who was burnt up in the fire of his eye would be
<>born as the son of Rukmin2i1, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's wife. Accord-
<>ingly, Rukmin2i1, conceived and a handsome child was
<>born to her.
<NI>S4ambara, who employed Ma1ya1vati1 as his kitchen-maid
<>had received a boon from S4iva. A condition laid down
<>in it was that S4ambara would die not long after
<>Ka1madeva's birth in the world. So S4ambara was mak-
<>ing careful enquiries to ascertain whether Ka1ma was
<>born anywhere in the world. It was during this period
<>that S4ambara received the news that Ka1ma had been
<>reborn as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's son. At once he went secretly to
<>Rukmin2i1's house and stole the little baby and threw it
<>into the sea. A sea-fish swallowed the child and a
<>fisherman who caught it presented it to S4ambara. When
<>S4ambara cut it open, he saw a lovely baby inside the
<>fish. He entrusted the child to Ma1ya1vati1 to be brought
<>up.
<NI>At this stage, the sage Na1rada happened to come there
<>and he explained to Ma1ya1vati1 in secret, that the baby
<>was Ka1madeva and she was Rati. From that time, she
<>brought up the child with great affection and tenderness.
<>As years passed and Ka1ma grew up into a youth,
<>Ma1ya1vati1 began to make amorous advances towards
<>him. Looking upon her with regard due to a mother,
<>Ka1ma was displeased with these advances. Then she told
<>him what Na1rada had disclosed to her about their rela-
<>tions in the past life. She advised him to kill S4ambara
<>and to leave the place for Dva1raka1 as soon as possible.
<NI>As advised by her, Ka1ma killed S4ambara and both he
<>and Ma1ya1vati1 went to Dva1raka1 in a Vima1na and paid
<>their respects to their parents there. In the presence of a
<>large number of sages, Ka1ma was christened “Prad-
<>yumna”. Aniruddha, the husband of Us2a1, was the son of
<>Pradyumna. Besides Aniruddha, Pradyumna had a
<>daughter Tr2s2a1.
<F>1.) From Katha1saritsa1gara we find that Udayana and Va1savadatta1 were the rebirths of Ka1ma and Rati.</F>

<HI>KA1MADEVA. See under Ka1ma.
<HI>KA1MADHENU. (SURABHI--NANDINI1).
<NI>1) {%General.%} She is the first mother of cattle. She is a
<>goddess with marvellous powers and attainments who
<>gives milk whenever needed by gods and sages. The
<>Pura1n2as declare that all the cattle in the world today
<>are descended from Ka1madhenu.
<NI>2) {%Three different names.%} This sacred cow is sometimes
<>called “Ka1madhenu”, at other times, “Surabhi” and
<>also “Nandini1”. They are not three different cows, as
<>some people suppose. See Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, Aran2ya Parva
<>Chapter 9, Verses 7 and 17. There Surabhi and Ka1ma-
<>dhenu are names used for referring to the same cow.
<>Again, in the Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 99,
<>Verse 14, we find the name Nandini1 applied to Ka1ma-
<>dhenu. Thus we may conclude that Ka1madhenu had
<>two other names, viz. Surabhi and Nandini1. But since
<>the term “Surabhirgavi” occurs in Amarakos4a, it follows
<>that even ordinary cows may be called “Surabhi”.
<NI>3) {%Birth and Jamily.%} In the Pura1n2as Surabhi is des-
<>cribed variously as Daks2a's daughter, Kas4yapa's wife,
<>Kas4yapa's daughter, etc. Although at first sight there
<>may appear some discrepancy in these statements, in
<>the light of them we may clearly arrive at the ancestry
<>and birth of Surabhi. Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, 14th Sarga says that Kas4yapa, the son of Mari1ci
<>and the grandson of Brahma1 married Daks2a Praja1pati's
<>daughters--Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodha-
<>va1s4a1, Manu and Anala1. From verses 20 and 21 in the
<>same Sarga we understand that Surabhi was the daugh-
<>ter of Krodhavas4a1, Daks2a's daughter, by Kas4yapa. In
<>the same Sarga we find that two daughters, Rohin2i1 and
<>Gandharvi1 were born to this Surabhi and from Rohin2i1
<>were born all the cows in the world that we see today [Page380-a+ 65]
<>and from Gandharvi1 were born all the horses. It was
<>by her own father Kas4yapa himself that Surabhi's off-
<>springs were born. Therefore, the reference to Surabhi
<>as the wife of Kas4yapa may also be justified.
<F>2) In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part I, Chapter 15, Surabhi is described as Kas4yapa's wife.</F> S4ince
<>Krodhavas4a1, the daughter of Daks2a was the mother of
<>Surabhi, actually Surabhi was the grand-daughter of
<>Daks2a, But in a broad sense, a grand-daughter may be
<>considered as a daughter. So the reference to Surabhi
<>in Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
<>28 as Daks2a's daughter is correct in that sense.
<NI>4) {%How Ka1madhenu Received Divine Powers.%} Long ago Aditi,
<>wife of Kas4yapa, conceived Maha1vis2n2u in her womb
<>and began an austere penance standing on one leg. At
<>that time Surabhi went to Kaila1sa and offered worship
<>to Brahma1 for ten thousand years. The gods who were
<>pleased, came to Surabhi taking Brahma1 with them.
<>Brahma1 said to her:--‘Surabhi I have made you a
<>goddess. You are now above the three worlds--Heaven
<>Earth and Hell. Your world, “Goloka” will become
<>famous. All people will worship you and the cows who
<>are your off spring.”
<NI>From that day on which Brahma1 blessed her, Surabhi
<>became a goddess with marvellous spiritual powers.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 83).
<NI>5) {%More than one Ka1madhenu?%} There are references to
<>several Ka1madhenus in the Pura1n2as. There is one Ka1ma-
<>dhenu in Va1sis2t2ha's A1s4rama. At Varun2a's ya1ga we see
<>another Ka1madhenu. There is no ground for believing
<>that there is only one Ka1madhenu and that it was
<>borrowed by each Deva in turn for some particular
<>occasion. It is possible that there were many Ka1ma-
<>dhenus in the family of Ka1madhenu and they were
<>owned by different Devas. Moreover it is stated that
<>several Ka1madhenus take their origin from sources
<>other than the family of Kas4yapa. One of them is from
<>the ocean of milk. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 18, we find that when the Devas and Asuras churned
<>the ocean of milk, along with many other precious
<>things, Ka1madhenu also came up to the surface.
<NI>There is a reference to another Ka1madhenu in Bha1s2a1
<>Bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 102, There, it is said,
<>Brahma1 who got Amr2ta swallowed it beyond limit in
<>his avidity and when he vomited, a Ka1madhenu came
<>out from his mouth. That Ka1madhenu is said to be
<>living in the world known as Rasa1tala. The above-
<>mentioned passage also says that there are four other
<>Ka1madhenus living on the four sides of the Ka1madhenu
<>which lives in Rasa1tala. They are Saurabhi1 in the east
<>Ham3sika1 in the south, Subhadra1 in the west and Dhenu
<>in the north.
<NI>The next Ka1madhenu is the one which was born from
<>the side of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his consort
<>Ra1dha1 were amusing themselves by amorous pleasures
<>in a remote and secluded place. When they were tired
<>they wished to drink some milk. At that time, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>created by his will power, the cow Surabhi and the
<>calf Manoratha, from the left side of his body. S4ri1-
<>da1man milked that cow into a new earthen pot and
<>when S4ri1 Kr2s2na was drinking it, the pot fell down and
<>the milk was spilt all over the floor. The milk which
<>spread over an area of 100 yojanas, became a lake
<>called “Ks2i1rasa1gara” for Ra1dha1 and her maids to bathe
<>and enjoy water-sports. Numerous cows were born
<>from the pores of Surabhi and they were presented to the [Page380-b+ 64]
<>Gopas by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 9th Skandha).
<>Like this, several Ka1madhenus are seen in the Pura1n2as.
<>Therefore there is no discrepancy or contradiction in
<>statements declaring that there were many Ka1madhenus
<>in different A1s4ramas. But since Ka1madhenu had
<>achieved divine powers by Brahma1's grace, it is but rea-
<>sonable to believe that the different Ka1madhenus are
<>really the different forms of the original Ka1madhenu,
<>the daughter of Kas4yapa.
<NI>6) {%Theft of Ka1madhenu by Satyavrata (Tris4an3ku).%} Satya-
<>vrata (Tris4an3ku) was the son of Arun2a, a King of the
<>Iks2va1ku dynasty. He was a vicious and immoral fellow.
<>Once he abducted a Bra1hman2a girl just at the time of
<>her marriage in her bridal dress. Enraged at this his
<>father drove him away from his palace. Satyavrata
<>wandered about aimlessly in the country and in the
<>forests.
<NI>Soon after this there was a famine in the land. Human
<>beings and animals began to die of starvation. At that
<>time Vis4va1mitra was performing penance in the forest
<>after leaving behind his wife and children in the country.
<>When he saw that the whole family was in danger of
<>death by starvation, he decided to make some money
<>by selling one of the sons, in order to save the lives of
<>the rest of the family. Satyavrata who came to know of
<>this, met Vis4va1mitra and dissuaded him from selling
<>his son. He promised to supply some flesh every day to
<>the family by hunting animals in the forest and keeping
<>the flesh suspended from the branch of a near-by tree.
<>Accordingly, he began leaving the flesh regularly hang-
<>ing from the branch of the tree. One day he
<>could not get any flesh by hunting. That night he went
<>to Vasis2t2ha's a1s4rama and stole Ka1madhenu. He killed
<>the cow and ate some of its flesh. The rest he gave to
<>Vis4va1mitra's family.
<NI>The next morning when Vasis2t2ha woke up, he did not
<>see his cow. But he came to know of the whole affair by
<>his intuition. In his fury he cursed Satyavrata and said
<>that the world would brand him with the name “Tris4an3-
<>ku” because he had committed three heinous sins viz. kill-
<>ing of cows, abducting another man's wife and incurring
<>his father's displeasure. After that Vasis2t2ha restored
<>Ka1madhenu to life. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>7) {%Vis4va1mitra attacked Ka1madhenu.%} Once while Vis4va1-
<>mitra was a ruling King, he went into a forest to hunt.
<>In the course of his rambles through the forest, he hap-
<>pened to arrive at Vasis2t2ha's A1s4rama with his retinue.
<>Vasis2t2ha called Ka1madhenu and ordered her to provide
<>food for Vis4va1mitra and his party. Ka1madhenu, by her
<>divine powers, prepared food within a short time and
<>gave them a sumptuous meal; Vis4va1mitra was greatly
<>pleased with this amazing feat of Ka1madhenu and he
<>asked Vasis2t2ha to give her to him. He even offered to
<>give crores of cows in return for her. But Vasis2t2ha
<>refused to comply with his request. Then Vis4va1mitra
<>tried to seize and take her away by force.
<NI>At once Ka1madhenu assumed the form of a terrible
<>monster of destruction. From the different parts of her
<>body emerged fierce warriors who clashed with Vis4va1-
<>mitra's followers. All the arrows shot by Vis4va1mitra
<>were caught by Vasis2t2ha with his hand. In the end
<>Vis4va1mitra admitted that the might of a Bra1hman2a is
<>superior to the might of a Ks2atriya. (Vasis2t2ha was a
<>Bra1hman2a and Vis4va1mitra a Ks2atriya). Vis4va1mitra, [Page381-a+ 65]
<>soon gave up his kingly duties and began penance,
<>thus turning himself into a “Ra1jars2i” (Royal saint).
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, 52nd Sarga; M.B.

<NI>2) {%Kam3sa, an incarnation of Ka1lanemi.%} In the sva1yam-
<>bhuvamanvantara Mari1ci had a wife named U1rn2a1 and
<>they had six mighty and powerful sons. One day they
<>ridiculed Brahma1 saying ‘A father who has married his
<>won daughter’ (Brahma1 married Sarasvati1, his own
<>daughter). Brahma1 became angry and cursed them to
<>be born as demons on earth. All the six sons were,
<>therefore, born as sons of a demon called Ka1lanemi on
<>earth. In their next birth they were born as sons of
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu. They led a pious life and pleased at
<>this Brahma1 asked them what boon they wanted and
<>they demanded that they should not be killed by any-
<>body. Their father, Hiran2yakas4ipu, did not like his
<>sons getting a boon behind his back and so he cursed
<>his sons “May you all six go to Pa1ta1la (nether-world)
<>and sleep there for a long time under the name of
<>S2ad2arbhakas. The sons begged for relief and Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu said that they would after sleeping for a long
<>time be born to Devaki1, wife of Vasudeva, as their
<>children and that Ka1lanemi, their father in their pre-
<>vious birth would then be born as Kam3sa and kill the
<>children of Devaki1 by striking their heads on the
<>ground.
<NI>Accordingly Ka1lanemi was born as Kam3sa and he
<>killed the six children of Devaki1 by striking them on
<>the ground. (Skandha 4, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>The 10th Skandha of Bha1gavata states “killing Ka1la-
<>nemi born as Kam3sa” when it refers to the killing of
<>Kam3sa.
<NI>3) {%Another story regarding the birth of Kam3sa.%} Kam3sa
<>was not actually the son of Ugrasena. It was Na1rada
<>who revealed to Kam3sa the story of his birth. It is as
<>follows.
<NI>Once when the wife of Ugrasena was in her menses she
<>went to the garden with her companions. Then a
<>Gandharva named Dramila disguised as Ugrasena
<>went to her but she knew the trick and cursed him
<>that he would go to hell. But Dramila committed rape
<>on her and then left the place making her pregnant.
<>When the child was born Ugrasena's wife greatly hated
<>the child got of an evil deed and cursed it saying that
<>the child would be killed by a member of the family
<>of Ugrasena. Thus Kam3sa was the son born to the wife
<>of Ugrasena by the Gandharva, Dramila. It was because
<>Kam3sa was aware of it that he behaved very badly to
<>Ugrasena and Kr2s2n2a. (10th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%How Kam3sa got Mathura1puri1.%} In olden times there
<>was a famous place called Madhuvana in the
<>river-base of Ka1lindi1. The place got the name of Madhu-
<>vana because the demon Madhu was residing there. [Page382-b+ 64]
<>Madhu had a son named Lavan2a. Lavan2a was a very
<>wicked demon always ill-treating the devas. S4atrughna,
<>son of Das4aratha, killed him and lived there establishing
<>a beautiful kingdom there. He named that place
<>Mathura1. After the death of S4atrughna two of his sons
<>ruled that country. Then when the Su1rya dynasty be-
<>came extinct the city of Mathura1 came into the possess-
<>ion of the Yadu dynasty. It was ruled then by a very
<>brave and valiant ruler named S4u1rasena. Vasudeva
<>father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was the son of S4u1rasena. After the
<>death of S4u1rasena another King of the Ya1dava dynasty,
<>Ugrasena, became the ruler of the place, Vasudeva
<>accepting cow-rearing as his profession. Kam3sa became
<>King keeping Ugrasena as a prisoner. (Skandha 4,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Vasudeva and Devaki1 are imprisoned.%} Vasudeva married
<>Devaki1 daughter of Ugrasena and sister, of Kam3sa.
<>Kam3sa pleased with his sister presented her with a
<>chariot. Kam3sa, Vasudeva and Devaki1 ascended the
<>chariot and Kam3sa himself drove the chariot. Then
<>from an unknown source above came a voice which
<>said “Oh King, know thou this and from this moment
<>chalk out thy plans for the future. The eighth son of
<>your sister will kill you for certain. You will be no
<>match against him.” (Chapter 1, Bha1gavata 10th
<>Skandha).
<NI>Hearing this voice from heaven Kam3sa got furious and
<>dragging his sister by the hair raised his sword to kill
<>her. Vasudeva then pleaded weeping not to kill Devaki1.
<>Only the eighth child of Devaki1 was going to kill him.
<>Vasudeva would hand over all the children to him as
<>soon as they were born. Such arguments pacified Kam3sa
<>and he left off Devaki1 without hurting her.
<NI>Devaki1 delivered a son. He grew up under the name
<>of Ki1rtima1n and one day Na1rada visited Kam3sa and
<>told him that he was the incarnation of an Asura named
<>Ka1lanemi and the son who would be born to Devaki1
<>to kill him was Na1ra1yan2a. Kam3sa, blind with fury,
<>killed Ki1rtima1n by striking him on the earth and im-
<>prisoned both Devaki1 and Vasudeva.

<>Mus2t2ika, Aris2t2aka, Kes4i1, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
<>Pu1tana1 were born in the Asura family as servants of
<>Kam3sa. He sent them to different sides of the country
<>to torment the Ya1davas. Many Ya1davas left the place.
<>Even Kam3sa's father Ugrasena, a great devotee of Vis2n2u
<>was teased.

<>smashing their heads against the ground below. The
<>seventh foetus of Devaki1 was aborted. (Instructed by
<>Maha1vis2n2u, Ma1ya1devi1 invoked the seventh foetus of
<>Devaki1 and transferred it to the womb of Rohin2i1
<>another wife of Vasudeva. The child thus born to Rohini1
<>was San3kars2an2a or Balabhadrara1ma1. Maha1vis2n2u then
<>entered the womb of Devaki1 instructing Ma1ya1devi1 to
<>enter that of Yas4oda1, wife of Nandagopa of Amba1d2i at
<>the same time. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was then born in the figure
<>of Vis2n2u. The watchmen were sleeping. Following
<>directions from the new-born child Vasudeva took the
<>child to Gokula and leaving the child there brought
<>back the child of Yas4oda1 and placed it near Devaki1.
<>When the watchmen awoke and knew about the deli-
<>very of Devaki1 they immediately ran to Kam3sa to tell [Page383-a+ 65]
<>him. Boiling with rage Kam3sa rushed to the side of
<>Devaki1 and taking the child by the legs raised it for
<>smashing it against the ground. The child to the fright-
<>ened dis may of Kam3sa slipped from his hand and
<>rising up in the air said “Hi, ill-mannered wicked
<>Kam3sa, do not waste your valour on women. Your
<>killer has already been born on earth. Do search for
<>him quickly.”
<NI>Kam3sa went pale with fright on hearing this and went
<>away to his palace.
<NI>7) {%Conspiracy of Kam3sa.%} The thought that his killer
<>was born somewhere made him restless. He let off
<>Vasudeva and Devaki1 finding them innocent. Then he
<>sat sadly pondering over the future. The courtiers then
<>advised him to kill all the children who had been born
<>within the past ten days and that would include the
<>killer also. Kam3sa accordingly sent to different parts
<>of the country his secret agents to kill all children, ten
<>days old.
<NI>During this campaign Pu1tana1, S4akat2a, Tr2n2a1varta,
<>Aris2t2aka and Kes4i1 tried to kill S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a also but
<>Kr2s2n2a killed them all easily. For details see under each
<>head separately. (10th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>8) {%Kam3sa is slain.%} Aris2t2aka was one of the prominent
<>Asuras sent to kill Kr2s2n2a. He attacked Kr2s2n2a in the
<>form of an ox. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed it without any diffi-
<>culty. Na1rada who saw this incident informed Kam3sa
<>about it adding that Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma were the
<>sons of Vasudeva only and the child who slipped out
<>of his hands was the child of Yasoda1. Kam3sa got furious
<>and he again imprisoned Vasudeva and Devaki1 and
<>brought to Mathura1 S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma
<>and started thinking of ways and means to kill them.
<>Kam3sa arranged to conduct a grand celebration of
<>A1yudhapu1ja1 (worship of the weapons) and invited
<>Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma for the same among many other
<>gopas from Amba1d2i. He sent his chariot with Akru1ra
<>to fetch Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma from Amba1d2i. Akru1ra
<>privately informed Kr2s2n2a of the bad intentions of
<>Kam3sa. Nandagopa and many others from Amba1d2i
<>started for Mathura1. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma started their journey in the chariot the gopas and
<>gopika1s assembled there cried loudly. Some blamed
<>Akru1ra.
<NI>Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma reached Mathura1. There they slew
<>a huge wild elephant and the five Asuras, Ca1n2u1ra,
<>Mus2t2ika, Ku1t2a, S4ala and Kosala whom Kam3sa had kept
<>ready to kill Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma. Sitting on a platform
<>watching this, Kam3sa became frightened and restless
<>and roared with rage thus “The sons of Nandagopa
<>should be instantly sent away from this palace. All
<>their wealth and all that of the gopas should be con-
<>fiscated. Bind with ropes the rogue Nandagopa, and
<>kill the wicked Vasudeva. Throw my father, Ugrasena,
<>into the river Ka1lindi1 bound hand and foot. Even a
<>father should be killed if he was a relative of one's
<>enemy.”
<NI>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma boiled with rage when they
<>heard the orders of Kam3sa and Kr2s2n2a, jumping on to
<>the platform pushed Kam3sa down and jumping down
<>along with him killed him. (10th Skandha, Bha1gavata).

<>Brahma1 gave him the name Kam3darpa alias Kandarpa.
<>(La1va1n2akalambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara, Taran3ga 6).
<HI>KAN2D2U. A great sage of ancient Bha1rata. He was the
<>father of Ma1ris2a1 (Va1rks2i1) wife of the Pracetas.
<NI>1) {%Birth of Ma1ris2a1.%} Ma1ris2a1, daughter of Kan2d2u, took
<>her birth from a tree. There is an interesting story about
<>this in Vis2n2u Pura1n2a.
<NI>Sage Kan2d2u, chief of the devajn5as, was performing
<>penance in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<>Gomati1. Devendra sent Pramloca1, an enchanting
<>nymph, to Kan2d2u to distract him from his penance.
<>Pramloca1 by her sweet words and enticing manners won
<>the heart of the sage and Kan2d2u accepting her as his
<>wife went to the valley of Mandara and lived there
<>happily for a hundred years.
<NI>One day Pramloca1 went and bowed before her husband
<>and sought his permission to go back to Devaloka.
<>“Dear, stay here for some time more” replied the sage.
<>Another hundred years went by. Again one day she
<>went and sought permission to go home. Again the
<>sage asked her to stay for a while more. Centuries
<>passed without the sage losing even a little of his
<>amour. On the other hand every day it found different
<>channels of expression. One evening the sage stepped
<>out of his A1s4rama and on seeing that Pramloca1 en-
<>quired where he was going.
<NI>Sage: The sun is going to set. I am going to do my
<>sandhya1vandana. I do not want to bring a break in
<>my daily ablutions and duties.
<NI>Pramloca1: Oh, Righteous one, did the sun set for you
<>only today ? The Sunset of hundreds of years has gone
<>by without your knowing.
<NI>Sage: Dear, you came to this holy river-shore only
<>this morning. It was only this morning that I saw you
<>coming to my A1s4rama for the first time. Now the day [Page384-b+ 65]
<>is over and dusk is coming. Why this ridicule? Please
<>do tell me the truth.
<NI>Pramloca1: That I came to you one fine morning is
<>quite true. But since that several centuries have
<>elapsed.
<NI>Sage: How many years have gone by since I started
<>enjoying with you?
<NI>Pramloca1.: Nine hundred years, six months and three
<>days have passed since I came to you.
<NI>The great sage became very angry and scolded
<>Pramloca1 much. That beautiful maiden heard it all
<>standing bathed in perspiration. The sage in rage
<>commanded the trembling nymph to go away from
<>his presence. Pramloca1, thus reprimanded and sent
<>away, rose up in the air and travelled by it. As she
<>flew, the perspiration of her body was absorbed by the
<>tender leaves of trees on the way. She was pregnant
<>at that time and the embryo which went forth along
<>with her perspiration was absorbed in bits by the
<>tender leaves and sprouts. Wind gathered them from the
<>different trees and made everything into one. Moon-
<>light gave it development and gave it the form of a
<>woman. She was named Ma1ris2a1. That was how Ma1ris2a1
<>was born of trees (Chapter 15, Am3s4a 1. Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%Curse of Kan2d2u.%} Kan2d2u's dear son aged sixteen
<>died in a forest. Grief-stricken, the sage cursed that
<>forest and made it a desert. There was no water
<>there and all the trees became dried and dead.
<>Hanu1ma1n and party who went in search of Si1ta1 came to
<>this place. (Chapter 48, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was a brahmin well-learned in
<>Ku1t2ani1ti (Diplomacy). The bad advice he gave to
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra became well-known as “Kan2ika's Ku1t2a-
<>ni1ti”.
<NI>2) {%Kan2ika's Ku1t2ani1ti.%} Once Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked Kan2ika
<>how to conquer one's enemies by using the four
<>methods of Sa1ma, Da1na, Bheda and Dan2d2a. Kan2ika
<>replied: “Threaten the timid ones. Give respect to
<>the brave and kill them by trickery. Give gifts to the
<>greedy ones. If any one becomes your enemy kill him
<>even if it be your father, preceptor, son, brother or
<>friend. Never speak insulting words about others even
<>when you are extremely angry. Never believe the
<>faithful and unfaithful alike.”
<NI>3) {%Kan2ika's story.%} Kan2ika justified his policy by means
<>of the story of a fox who put into practice the four
<>tricks to gain his end.
<NI>Once there was a very selfish fox in a forest. He felt a
<>desire to eat the flesh of a lion. For that end he made
<>friends with a tiger, a rat and a mongoose. The fox
<>advised the rat to gnaw the paws of the lion and make
<>it lame. The tiger should then kill the lion. The lion
<>was killed and the fox suggested that they could have
<>a hearty meal of the lion after a bath. Everybody [Page385-a+ 63]
<>excepting the fox went for his bath and the fox stood
<>watch over the carcass of the lion. First came the tiger
<>after his bath. The fox looked worried and the tiger
<>asked him the reason why. The fox said “Comrade,
<>the rat says with arrogance that he it was that killed the
<>lion. My pride does not allow me to eat what the rat
<>claims to be his kill.” Hearing this the proud tiger
<>left the place saying “Let me see whether I can kill
<>my prey without the help of anybody.”
<NI>Sometime later the rat came after its bath. The sly
<>fox said “My friend, the mongoose says that the flesh
<>of a lion is poison. It says “Let the rat eat it and die.”
<>Hearing this the rat went its way.
<NI>Then came the mongoose. The fox threatened it and it
<>went away. The fox then ate the flesh of the lion by
<>himself and was contented.
<NI>Kan2ika then said that the Kings should use such tricks
<>against their enemies. (Chapter 139, A1di Parva).
<HI>KAN2IKA II. There is a statement in Maha1bha1rata
<>about another brahmin of the Bharadva1ja family who

<HI>KAN2VA I. (KA1S4YAPA).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Kan2va attained Pura1n2ic fame
<>as the father who brought up S4akuntala1. From R2gveda [Page385-b+ 64]
<>it can be gathered that the Kan2va family was very
<>prominent among the R2s2i families of ancient India.
<>Because he was born in the family of sage Kas4yapa,
<>son of Brahma1, Kan2va was known as Ka1s4yapa also.
<>Kan2va's father was Medha1tithi as could be seen by a
<>reference to him in S4loka 27, Chapter 208 of S4a1nti
<>Parva as Medha1tithisuta. Kan2va was staying in a her-

<>They fell in love with each other and soon Menaka1
<>bore a girl. The parents left the child in the forest and

<>ally Kan2va came that way and took the child to his
<>A1s4rama.
<NI>4) {%The Ya1ga of Bharata.%} Bharata, son of Dus2yanta,

<>Duryodhana how Ma1tali and his wife Sudharma1 went
<>to him in search of a suitable husband to their daughter
<>Gun2akes4i1. (Chapter 97, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Kan2va, a sage of the east.%} When S4ri1 Ra1ma returned

<>fourth by that of Va1madeva, the fifth by Atri, the sixth
<>by that of Bharadva1ja and the seventh by the family
<>of Vasis2t2ha. Fifty Su1ktas of the first Man2d2ala and the
<>whole of the eighth Man2d2ala were written by Kan2va.
<NI>(ii) Kan2va had a son named Medha1tithi. Su1kta twelve
<>of Anuva1ka four in the first Man2d2ala of R2gveda is
<>written making Medha1tithi a sage.
<NI>(iii) Kan2va had a daughter named Indi1varaprabha1
<>by Menaka1. (Katha1saritsa1gara). (See under Candra1-

<HI>KA1N2VAS4IRAS. A caste. Originally they were Ks2atriyas.

<>Ga1dhi, King of Kanya1kubja.
<NI>2) {%Origin of this city.%} Once there was a great sage
<>named Kus4a who was the son of Brahma1. He had of
<>his wife Vaidarbhi1 four sons named Kus4a1mba, Kus4a-
<>na1bha, Asu1rtarajasa and Vasu. Kus4a asked them each
<>to rule a country and so each of them built a city of
<>his own. Kus4a1mba named his city Kaus4a1mbi1, Kus4a-
<>na1bha gave his city the name of Mahodayapura,
<>Asu1rtarajasa called his city Dharma1ran2ya and Vasu
<>called his city Girivraja. Of these Mahodayapura,
<>city of Kus4ana1bha, became later famous as Kanya1kubja.
<>(Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%How Mahodayapura became Kanya1kubja.%} Kus4ana1bha
<>begot a hundred daughters of the nymph Ghr2ta1ci1
<>Those beautiful girls were once playing in the forests
<>when the wind-god fell in love with them. The girls
<>rejected his love and Va1yu getting angry with them
<>cursed them and made them hunchbacks. Because the
<>hundred Kanyaka1s (girls) became Kubja1s (hunch-
<>backs) at that place, the place became known as Kanya1-
<>kubja.
<NI>When the daughters returned to the palace as hunch-
<>backs Kus4ana1bha was greatly distressed. Weeping, the
<>girls told him what had happened. At that time a sage
<>named Cu1li1 was performing penance in a forest nearby.
<>Somada1, daughter of U1rmila1, a gandharva lady, married
<>Cu1li1 and they got a son named Brahmadatta. This
<>Brahmadatta married the hundred hunchbacks of
<>Kus4ana1bha and the very touch of Brahmadatta trans-
<>formed the hunchbacks into beautiful girls.
<NI>After having given his daughters in marriage Kus4ana1bha
<>conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i ya1ga to get a son. In that

<HI>KANYA1KUMA1RI1 (KANYAKU1PA; KANYA1TI1RTHA)
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Maha1bha1rata makes references
<>in many places to Kanya1kuma1ri1, the southern extremi-
<>ty of former Kerala and Gokarn2a, the northern
<>boundary. It must, therefore, be surmised that these
<>two holy places were very ancient ones. Vana Parva,
<>praises Kanya1kuma1ri1 at many places. If any one bathes
<>at this place one will become very famous. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>Chapter eightyfive of Aran2ya Parva, of Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata
<>speaks praisingly of Kanya1kuma1ri1 and Gokarn2a among
<>other places. It says thus: [Page386-b+ 63]
<>“If you visit R2s2abha1cala of Pa1n2d2yades4a you will get the
<>benefit of conducting an As4vamedhaya1ga. Then you
<>must go farther south and take a dip in Kanya1ti1rt2ha.
<>The touch of that water absolves you of all sins. Then
<>visit Gokarn2a situated in the ocean famous in all the
<>three worlds and worshipped by all.”
<NI>From this it is to be understood that ot the time of
<>Maha1bha1rata Kanya1kuma1ri1 was part of Pa1n2d2yades4a
<>and that Gokarn2a was an island.
<NI>2) {%Pura1n2ic stories about Kanya1kuma1ri1.%} There are several
<>stories regarding the origin and renown of Kanya1-
<>kuma1ri1 in the Pura1n2as. The most important ones are
<>given below.
<NI>(1) {%Absolver of sins.%} The wife of a brahmin named
<>Apan5cika living in Ka1s4i1 became unchaste and to wash
<>away her sin she came to Kanya1kuma1ri1 walking all
<>the way and did penance there, daily bathing in its
<>waters. She attained Salvation and it is believed that
<>a bath in its waters would absolve anybody of all his
<>sins. (Man2imekhala).
<NI>(2) {%Cakra ti1rtha of Kanya1kuma1ri1.%} Pun2yaka1s4i1, daughter of
<>Maya1sura, once went to Kaila1sa and worshipped S4iva.
<>After three yugas S4iva appeared before her and asked
<>her what she wanted. She replied that she wanted to
<>be merged in S4iva always. S4iva then said ‘Three
<>hundred and sixtyfive days would make a year. Four
<>lakhs and thirtythree years would make a Kali Yuga.
<>Kr2ta, Treta1, Dva1para and Kali are four Yugas and
<>when two thousand such Yugas are over Brahma1
<>finishes a day. Such thirty days make one month and
<>twelve months, a year for Brahma1. When such hundred
<>years of Brahma1 are over the great deluge comes. Such
<>ten deluges make a na1zhika1 (twentyfour minutes) of
<>Vis2n2u. Counting thus when you pass ten Vis2n2u deluges
<>S4iva passes a second. Then is the time for the fulfil-
<>ment of your desire. Till that time you sit in medita-
<>tion on the shores of the south seas. Your hermitage
<>would be known as Kanya1ks2etra or Tapah2 Sthala.
<>During your stay there you must kill all the wicked
<>people like Ba1n2a1sura and give relief to the people. I
<>will also come and stay with you there then.”
<NI>Pun2yaka1s4i1 after prostrating before S4iva went to the
<>south seas. Taking a Japama1la1 (necklace for prayer) in
<>her hands she assumed the name Kanya1kuma1ri1, and
<>started her penance. After conquering all the three
<>worlds demon Ba1n2a was having a wicked rule over his
<>people when he saw Kanya1kuma1ri1 and asked her to be
<>his wife. He approached her with his wicked servants
<>Durmukha and Durdars4ana. But Kanya1kuma1ri1 flatly
<>refused and in the battle that ensued, Ba1n2a1sura fell dead
<>by the Cakra1yudha (Discus) of Devi1 and at that spot
<>is the Cakrati1rtha. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<NI>(3) The phantom child which escaped from the hands
<>of Kam3sa at the time of the birth of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was that
<>divine lady Kanya1kuma1ri1. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>3) {%The Geographical view.%} It is said that there was an
<>extension of the present continent to the south and that
<>expansive land called Lamu1ria was later submerged in
<>waters. There is a description of such an extended land
<>in some of the old literature like Cilappadika1ram.”
<>Kanya1kuma1ri1 which was called ‘Kuma1ri-amba1di’ also
<>was the first setu; Dhanus2kot2i the middle setu; and
<>Kot2ikkara, last setu. (Setu Pura1n2a) [Page387-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%In History.%} Kanya1kuma1ri1 had attracted the atten-
<>tion of foreigners long before Christ. Herodotus who
<>lived in the third century B.C. has written about
<>Kanya1kuma1ri1 in one of his books.
<NI>In the book ‘Periplus’ written in 60 A.D. there is a
<>mention of Kanya1kuma1ri1. It says: “Pious persons at
<>the fag end of their lives dedicate their lives to God
<>and go to Kanya1kuma1ri1 on a pilgrimage and stay there
<>accepting an ascetic life. A divine lady bathed in the
<>holy waters there grants you ‘dars4ana’.”
<NI>Ptolemy another traveller who lived two thousand years
<>ago refers to Kanya1kuma1ri1 in his book as ‘Komaria
<>Akron’. He had bathed in those waters and worshipped
<>in the Kanya1kuma1ri1 temple.
<NI>Marco Polo of Venice who had travelled these parts in
<>1243 A.D. has written of his worshipping in the Kanya1-
<>kuma1ri1 temple. He has also recorded having seen thirty
<>miles from Kanya1kuma1ri1 a glittering figure like that of
<>the Pole-star.
<NI>Ibn Batu1ta1 who lived in 1203 A.D. has referred to
<>Kanya1kuma1ri1 in his book as Ra1skum3hari.
<HI>KANYA1SAM3VEDYATI1RTHA. An ancient holy place.
<>It is believed that those who visit this place will attain
<>the world of Praja1patimanu. (Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<HI>KANYA1S4RAMA. A holy place. If a man spends three
<>nights at this place he would attain Svarga. (Chapter
<>83, Vana Parva).
<HI>KAPA(S). A company of Asuras. The Maha1bha1rata
<>gives a story of how the brahmins killed these demons.
<>The As4vini1devas once came to the earth and gave eye-
<>sight to the blind sage Cyavana. It was the time when
<>Indra had denied Soma juice to the As4vini1devas. Sage
<>Cyavana got back his eyesight and promised the
<>As4vini1devas that he would lift the ban on wine for
<>them. Cyavana conducted a Ya1ga to which the As4vini1-
<>devas were also invited. Indra and the other devas
<>refused to take the sacrificial wine and butter along
<>with the As4vini1devas. Cyavana got angry and he pro-
<>duced from the sacrificial fire an Asura named Mada.
<>With a huge mouth and long teeth the demon went
<>round eating all the Devas. All at once Cyavana con-
<>quered the earth and the Kapas subjugated heaven.
<>When they lost both heaven and earth the Devas
<>approached the brahmins for help. The brahmins
<>started a war against the Kapas. The Kapas sent Dhani
<>to the brahmins for peace-talks. Dhani said “The Kapas
<>are equal to you, Oh brahmins, and so why do you
<>fight them? They are well-versed in Vedas and are very
<>wise men who are entitled to conduct Ya1gas. They are
<>righteous persons similar to Brahmars2is. Prosperity
<>lives in them. They never keep unchaste wives nor do
<>they eat stale meat. It is not proper to fight against
<>such virtuous persons.”
<NI>But the brahmins did not pay heed to what Dhani said
<>and they killed all the Kapas in bulk. The Kapas,
<>though they were born Asuras, were good-natured
<>persons. (Chapter 157, Anus4a1sana Parva)
<HI>KAPA1LA. See under Brahma1, 5th Para.
<HI>KAPA1LAMOCANA. A holy place on the shores of the
<>river Sarasvati1, in Kuruks2etra. (Chapter 88, Vana
<>Parva; See under Rahodara and S4iva).
<HI>KAPA1LI1 I. One of the eleven Rudras. This Rudra was
<>the son of Stha1n2u, son of Brahma1. (Chapter 66, A1di
<>Parva). According to the Maha1bha1rata the eleven
<>Rudras are the following: Mr2gavya1dha, Sarpa, Nirr2ti, [Page387-b+ 65]
<>Ajaikapa1t, Ahirbudhnya, Pina1ki1, I1s4vara, Kapa1li1,
<>Stha1n2u, Bharga and Dahana. (See under Kapardi1).
<>The eleven Rudras are referred to in different ways
<>in Agni Pura1n2a and Vis2n2u Pura1n2a.
<HI>KAPA1LI1 II. S4iva. The Maha1bha1rata gives the follow-
<>ing story regarding the reason for S4iva's getting the
<>name of Kapa1li1.
<NI>Once a great controversy arose regarding the supreme
<>sovereignty of the three worlds between Brahma1 and
<>Vis2n2u. Then there came to their midst an effulgence
<>of S4iva and a voice from heaven said “He who finds
<>the source of this brilliance is the real sovereign of the
<>three worlds”. Brahma1 went up to find the upper end
<>and Vis2n2u went down to find the lower end. They
<>travelled for a very long time without finding the end
<>when Brahma1 saw a Ketaki1 flower coming down. On
<>enquiry the flower said it was coming from the origin
<>of the brilliance and that three Brahma1 deluges had
<>elapsed since its starting from there. Brahma1 took that
<>flower and went to Vis2n2u. Vis2n2u asked Brahma1 whether
<>he had seen the end of the effulgence and Brahma1 said
<>‘yes’. Immediately the flower in the hand of Brahma1
<>turned into the figure of S4iva and cut off one of the
<>heads of Brahma1 making five-headed Brahma1 into four-
<>headed. The angered Brahma1 cursed S4iva “May you
<>go begging with a Kapa1la (human skull) in your hand.”
<>Thus S4iva became a Kapa1li1. S4iva cursed Brahma1 back
<>saying “You will not be worshipped by anyone” (See
<>under S4iva, Brahma1).
<HI>KAPARDI1. One of the eleven Rudras. According to
<>Agni Pura1n2a the Eka1das4a Rudras (eleven Rudras) are
<>the following: Hara, Bahuru1pa, Tryambaka, Apara1jita,
<>Vr2s2a1kapi, S4ambhu, Kapardi1, Raivata, Mr2gavya1dha,
<>Sarpa and Kapa1li1. (Chapter 18, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>KAPAT2A. A demon. He was Kas4yapa's son born of
<>his wife Danu. (Chapter 65, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>KAPAT2ABHIKS2U. A false sage. To illustrate the fact
<>that if a man fails in his deceit he will be subjected to
<>ridicule, a story of a false sage occurs in Katha1saritsa1-
<>gara. Since this Character has earned a place in the
<>Indian literature his story is given below:
<NI>There was once a city called Ma1kandi1 on the banks of
<>the river Gan3ga1. In that city lived a sage who
<>observed silence as a Vrata. One day when he went
<>begging he saw a beautiful girl in a Vais4ya's house and
<>the false ascetic was attracted by her. Breaking his
<>silence he said “What a pity!” and left the place. The
<>Vais4ya was worried why the sage said so and approached
<>him and asked why he broke his silence to say so. The
<>sage said: “Your daughter is ill-omened. If you give her
<>in marriage all of you remaining will perish. So pack her
<>in a box and with a torch burning on the top of it set it
<>afloat on the river.” The Vais4ya did so.
<NI>The sage coming to his A1s4rama called his disciples to
<>his side and said “To-night a box with a torch burning
<>on the top of it will come floating on the river. You
<>must take it and bring it to me without opening it.”
<NI>The disciples went to the river and seeing the box
<>coming floating caught it and took it to their preceptor.
<>But from a point high up in the river a prince had seen
<>the box coming floating and had opened it. He had
<>then released the girl from the box and had floated the
<>box again filling it with a black monkey. When the
<>disciples got the box to the guru he said “Take it up-
<>stairs and keep it there. There is a Pu1ja1 to be conduct- [Page388-a+ 65]
<>ed with the recital of sacred verses. It should not be
<>seen by others. You can all go to sleep.”
<NI>The false sage went up eager to enjoy the girl in the
<>box and opened the box with pleasant thoughts. But to
<>his utter horror there jumped from the box a ferocious
<>black monkey who mauled him terribly. The Kapat2a-
<>bhiks2u was fooled. (Taran3ga 1. La1va1n2akalambaka,
<>Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>KA1PI1. A river. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse
<>24).
<HI>KAPIDHVAJA. Arjuna.
<HI>KAPILA I. A fierce sage.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Kapila was the son of Kardama-
<>praja1pati, son of Brahma1, born to him of his wife
<>Devahu1ti, grand-daughter of Brahma1 and daughter of
<>Sva1yambhuva Manu.
<NI>Sva1yambhuva Manu got two sons named Priyavrata and
<>Utta1napa1da and three daughters named A1ku1ti, Deva-
<>hu1ti and Prasu1ti. The daughters were married to Ruci,
<>Kardama and Daks2a respectively. To Ruci was born of
<>A1ku1ti a boy named Yajn5a. He was a partial incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u. To Kardama was born of his wife Devahu1ti
<>Kapila1ca1rya, a great sage and the celebrated exponent
<>of the Sa1n3khya philosophy. Prasu1ti got many daughters
<>(8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>Sage Kapila was known as Cakradhanus also. (S4loka 17
<>Chapter 109, Udyoga Parva).
<NI>Kardama married the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu
<>called Devahu1ti. They spent their honeymoon in the
<>air travelling throughout the world. Devahu1ti delivered
<>nine daughters and a son named Kapila. Kardamapra-
<>ja1pati gave his daughters in marriage to Mari1ci and the
<>other sages.
<NI>2) {%Kapila--incarnation of Vis2n2u.%} The Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a states that Kapila was the incarnation of Vis2n2u.
<>In Chapter 93 there is this statement: “Bhagava1n
<>Na1ra1yan2a will protect us all. The Lord of the universe
<>has now been born in the world as Kapila1ca1rya.”
<NI>3) {%Kapila imparts spiritual knowledge to his mother.%} Kapila
<>started a severe penance. At that time Kardamapra-
<>ja1pati died and Devahu1ti wife of Kardama and mother
<>of Kapila approached Kapila and asked him to instruct
<>her on the path of Bhakti Yoga. Kapila imparted to her
<>spiritual knowledge and gave her instructions to follow
<>the path of Bhakti Yoga for Salvation. She entered into
<>a life of austerities and attained Sama1dhi. (3rd Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%How Kapila burnt to ashes the Sagarputras.%} Once there
<>was a king called Sagara in the Solar dynasty. He had
<>two wives named Kes4ini1 and Sumati. Kes4ini1 got a son
<>named Asaman5jasa and Sumati got sixtythousand sons.
<>Once Sagara conducted an As4vamedha Ya1ga at a place
<>where the rivers Sindhu and Gan3ga1 meet. Am3s4uma1n,
<>son of Asaman5jasa led the sacrificial horse. Indra dis-
<>guised as a demon stole the horse when it came to a
<>mountain side and hid it in the nether worlds.
<NI>Sagara sent his sixtythousand sons in search of the horse.
<>They dug the whole continent of Jambu1dvi1pa surround-
<>ed by mountains. Devas, gandharvas and bhujan3gas
<>complained to Brahma1. Then Brahma1 said: “The whole
<>of this world belongs to Vis2n2u. He has incarnated him-
<>self as sage Kapila to kill the sons of Sagara and is
<>now in the nether-world bearing this world. In the fire
<>of his anger the Sagaraputras will be burnt to death”.
<>On hearing this all of them came back. [Page388-b+ 64]
<NI>The Sagaraputras returned to their father when they
<>could not find the horse. But Sagara ordered “Go and
<>dig again till you find it”. They went to the nether
<>world. After circling the eight elephants who carry the
<>world they dropped down to the nether world through
<>the north-east corner of the earth. There they saw sage
<>Kapila engaged in penance and the sacrificial horse
<>grazing by his side. The sons of Sagara made a great
<>hubbub there and Kapila produced a big sound of
<>rebuke and stared at them. All the sixtythousand sons
<>of Sagara were reduced to ashes. For more details see
<>under Bhagi1ratha. (Sargas 39 and 40, Ba1laka1n2d2a.
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>5) {%Kapilayogas4a1stra.%} Kapila made the renowned Kapila-
<>s4a1stra sitting in his A1s4rama and taught it to his mother
<>Devahu1ti. Kapila was a great yogin. The yoga S4a1stra
<>itself is based on the Sa1n3khya philosophy of Kapila. His
<>Sa1n3khya S4a1stra, known as Ka1pila S4a1stra also, contains
<>the distinctive yoga of meditation and it creates in you
<>spiritual knowledge removing your ignorance totally.
<>After teaching his mother his ‘Ka1pila’ he went to the
<>A1s4rama of Pulaha and lived there. (8th Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).

<NI>1) {%General information.%} A King of Iks2va1ku Vam3s4a.
<>Descending in order from Iks2va1ku came Vim3s4a--
<>Kalya1n2a--Khani1netra--Suvarcas. Suvarcas later on
<>became famous as Karandhama.
<NI>2) {%How he got his name Karandhama.%} Once there came
<>a famine in the country of Suvarcas. The treasury [Page390-a+ 65]
<>became empty. Taking that opportunity the enemies
<>attacked his country. There was no army for him to
<>fight against his enemies. Meditating upon God he
<>blew his hands and then an army sufficient to fight
<>his enemies appeared before him and using that he
<>defeated them. Because he arranged an army by
<>Karadhamana (blowing of hands) he was given the
<>name of Karandhamana also.

<>called Pan5ca ti1rthas. In the course of Arjuna's
<>pilgrimage, he visited these Pan5ca ti1rthas. At that
<>time, the Sages never used to go there. There was a
<>special reason for it. The five celestial women, Varga1,
<>Saurabheyi1, Sami1ci1, Budbuda1 and Lata1 used to live in
<>them in the form of crocodiles as a result of a sage's
<>curse. Arjuna liberated all of them. (For details see

<HI>KARAN5JANILAYA1. Anala1, the mother of all trees.
<>She was the daughter of Daks2a and the wife of

<>got of his wife Ks2ama1 three sons named Kardama,
<>Urvari1ya1n and Sahis2n2u. (Chapter 10, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a). Of these three Kardama married Devahu1ti.
<>Devahu1ti was the daughter of Sva1yambhuva Manu and
<>sister of A1ku1ti and Prasu1ti. (8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>Devahu1ti was an ideal wife and served her husband
<>with great devotion. Kardama was pleased with his
<>wife and presented her with an aeroplane. Kardama
<>and Devahu1ti conducted then a tour of the worlds in
<>that plane. Devahu1ti delivered nine daughters and a
<>son. The daughters were married to Mari1ci and other

<NI>2) {%The curse.%} Once Karkot2aka cheated the sage Na1rada.
<>The angry sage cursed him and said that he would
<>have to remain without the power of movements in
<>the forest till Nala came to rescue him. From that day
<>Karkot2aka lived in that forest, awaiting the arrival of
<>Nala.
<NI>3) {%Nala and Karkot2aka.%} Once a wild fire spread all
<>over the forest. Karkot2aka whose power of movement
<>was destroyed by Na1rada's curse, cried aloud, calling
<>upon Nala to come and save him. It was at this time
<>that Nala arrived at the spot after leaving Damayanti1
<>in the forest. Nala came to him, on hearing his cries.
<>The serpent informed Nala about the story of Na1rada's
<>curse and reducing himself to the size of a thumb sat
<>on the ground. Nala removed him to a safe spot away [Page391-a+ 64]
<>from the fire. The serpent asked Nala to walk a few
<>steps counting his footsteps. Nala did so and at the
<>tenth step, Karkot2aka stung him and his whole body
<>was turned blue. Suddenly Karkot2aka assumed his own
<>original shape and spoke to Nala as follows:--“I have
<>changed your appearance so that people may not be
<>able to recognize you. Kali who is troubling you, still
<>lives within you. It is he who is affected by my
<>poison. You need not fear danger from poison any
<>more. You will never be defeated in battle. Go and
<>engage yourself as the charioteer of R2tuparn2a, King of
<>Ayodhya1. You will teach him As4vahr2daya mantra. In
<>return for it he will teach you Aks2ahr2daya mantra.
<>Here are two garments which I give you. If you put

<>May you be blessed again with a happy family life.”
<>After saying this, Karkot2aka vanished. (M.B. Vana

<>those born in this land enjoy a life in Svarga, on earth
<>or in hell according to the class to which their actions
<>belong namely Sa1ttvic, Ra1jasic or Ta1masic. It is possible
<>for only this land to obtain for its people life in other
<>worlds.
<F>1) According to a belief of old, all other parts of the world excepting Bha1ratavars2a were inhabited by Devas.</F> Therefore this land got the name Karmabhu1mi.
<>(8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>KARMAJIT. A King of the family of Arjuna. He was

<HI>KARN2A I. The eldest son of Kunti1. Though he was the
<>brother of the Pa1n2d2avas he joined sides with the Kaura-
<>vas and became the King of An3ga. So the name of
<>Karn2a comes in the genealogy of the An3ga royal family.

<NI>2) {%Birth of Karn2a.%} Pa1n2d2u, a King of Candravam3s4a,
<>married Kunti1, daughter of King S4u1rasena. This girl
<>was brought up even from childhood by a King called
<>Kuntibhoja. She grew up in the palace of the King. She
<>was once put in charge of attending to the welfare of
<>those engaged in religious duties. The sage Durva1sas
<>came there then and stayed for four months as the king's
<>guest. Kunti1 served the sage during his stay there with
<>so much care, patience and devotion that the sage was
<>immensely pleased and gave her at the time of his de-
<>parture a divine mantra. If she called upon any god
<>repeating that mantra once, that god would manifest
<>himself to her and bless her with a son equal to him [Page391-b+ 63]
<>in glory. The mantra was to be used only five times.
<>Kunti1 was young and wanted to test the power of the
<>mantra. So she recited the mantra meditating on the
<>Sun. Instantly she felt she saw a divine person coming
<>to her from the sun. She was perplexed. But the
<>divine form embraced her and consoled her saying that
<>she would never lose her virginity even if she bore a
<>son from him. None excepting her step-mother knew
<>about this. In due course Kunti1 delivered a male child
<>and with the help of her step-mother she put that child
<>in a box and floated it on the river As4va1.
<NI>That box leaving the river As4va1 entered the Yamuna1
<>river and leaving Yamuna1 it entered the river Gan3ga1.
<>Drifting slowly the box reached Campa1puri1, a country
<>of Su1tas. Adhiratha born of the Su1tavam3s4a and an ally
<>of the Kauravas, saw a box floating on the river while
<>he went for his bath and took it home. Ra1dha1, wife of
<>Adhiratha, who was childless was greatly pleased to see
<>a babe inside the box and they adopted it and brought
<>it up. The boy was named Vasus2en2a. It was this babe
<>that became the celebrated Karn2a afterwards. (Four
<>chapters from 305, Vana Parva).
<NI>3) {%Education of Karn2a.%} Karn2a grew up in the house of
<>Adhiratha in the country of An3ga bearing the names
<>Vasus2en2a and Vr2s2a. Kunti1 knew this through spies.
<>When the time came for imparting education to Karn2a
<>Adhiratha sent him to Hastina1pura to the presence of
<>Dron2a for teaching him archery. Karn2a studied under
<>Kr2pa and Paras4ura1ma also. After his education he
<>entered into a treaty with Duryodhana. (Chapter 309,
<>Vana Parva).
<NI>4) {%Karn2a is cursed.%} Karn2a was cursed by a brahmin and
<>Paras4ura1ma. The story is given below.
<NI>Even while they were studying archery Arjuna and
<>Karn2a vied with each other. Karn2a once requested
<>Dron2a to teach him in private the secret of the Brahma1
<>missile to fight against Arjuna. But Dron2a did not
<>accede to his request.
<NI>Karn2a then went to Mahendragiri and bowed before
<>Paras4ura1ma and represented himself as a member of the
<>Bhr2gu family. He said he had come to him to be his
<>disciple and learn the secret of the Brahma1 missile from
<>him. Paras4ura1ma believed him and accepting him as
<>his disciple taught him many new techniques in archery.
<>Once Karn2a was wandering in the vicinity of the
<>a1s4rama when he saw a lonely cow grazing there and
<>Karn2a without knowing that it belonged to a brahmin
<>sent an arrow and killed it. The brahmin got furious
<>and cursed Karn2a thus “Oh, sinner, the wheel of your
<>chariot would go down in the mud when you face the
<>enemy to fight against whom you are now taking training.
<>Then, when you stand perplexed, your opponent would
<>cut off your head.” Karn2a requested for a removal of
<>the curse but the brahmin refused to show any mercy.
<NI>Paras4ura1ma taught Karn2a the secret of the Brahma1
<>missile. One day tired after a day's fast and a walk
<>around the a1s4rama with his disciples Paras4ura1ma slept
<>resting his head on the lap of Karn2a. Then a
<>beetle named Alarka attacked Karn2a and started sucking
<>blood from his thigh. Blood was oozing from his thigh
<>and still Karn2a did not stir from his position lest it
<>should disturb his guru in his nap. Suddenly Paras4u-
<>ra1ma awoke and stared at the beetle and the beetle fell [Page392-a+ 64]
<>dead. It then took the form of a demon and rising up
<>in the air said “Sva1min! I was once a demon called
<>Dam3s4a. Once I carried away by force the wife of the
<>sage Bhr2gu and the angered sage cursed me and made
<>me a beetle. When I craved for pardon he said
<>that I would be given my original form by Paras4u-
<>ra1ma.”
<NI>When the demon disappeared saying so much Paras4u-
<>ra1ma turned to Karn2a who stood with respect, his dress
<>all covered with blood. Paras4ura1ma said: “No brah-
<>min can bear so much pain with such patience. Surely,
<>you are not a brahmin. Let me know the truth.” Trem-
<>bling with fear Karn2a revealed his identity and then
<>Paras4ura1ma cursed him saying “You will forget the
<>secret of the Brahma1 missile at the time when you want
<>to use it against your enemy.” (Chapters 2 and 3, S4a1nti
<>Parva).
<NI>5) {%How Karn2a became the King of An3ga.%} The Pa1n2d2avas
<>and Kauravas were studying archery under Dron2a1ca1rya
<>together and Karn2a also was among them. When their
<>education was complete a day was fixed to exhibit the
<>skill of the students. The public also was invited to see
<>the skill of the princes. Everybody showed his best and
<>Arjuna displayed super-human skill so that the vast
<>assemblage was lost in wonder and admiration. Then
<>strode Karn2a to the scene and not only did he duplicate
<>with ease Arjuna's feats but he did show something
<>more. The assemblage was dumbfounded. Arjuna turnn-
<>ed pale. At this moment Kr2pa stood up and questioned
<>the right of Karn2a to compete with those with royal
<>blood in them. Then rose Duryodhana and said: “If
<>the combat is not in order simply because Karn2a is not
<>a prince it is easily remedied. I crown Karn2a as the
<>King of An3ga”. Then there came to the scene the aged
<>Adhiratha, the foster-father of Karn2a, and as Karn2a
<>saw him coming he went and bowed before him and
<>Adhiratha embraced him with tears in his eyes. (Chap-
<>ters 134 to 136, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Karn2a's armour and ear-rings.%} Karn2a was born with an
<>armour on his body and rings in his ears. Chapter 99
<>of Adi Parva says thus: “To Kunti1 was born of Su1rya
<>the mighty Karn2a. Even at his birth he was adorned
<>with an armour over his body and rings in his ears.”
<NI>Su1rya had ordained that as long as Karn2a wore the
<>armour and ear-rings he would be unconquerable.
<>Indra knew this and wanted to get Karn2a rid of these
<>so that Arjuna, his son, might gain a victory over Karn2a.
<>Karn2a was reputed for his charity and Indra under the
<>garb of a brahmin went to Karn2a and begged of him
<>his ear-rings and armour. The Sun god had already
<>warned him in a dream that Indra would thus try to
<>deceive him. Still Karn2a could not bring himself to refuse
<>any gift that was asked of him and so he cut off the
<>ear-rings and armour with which he was born and gave
<>them to the Bra1hman2a. The only request that the noble
<>Karn2a did make was that in separating the ornaments
<>from his body no wound should be made. Indra did it
<>with great skill neither hurting him nor making even a
<>scratch on this body. Indra bade Karn2a ask for any
<>boon he wanted. The Sun god had also advised him to
<>ask for a good weapon in return in case he gave away
<>his assets and so he requested Indra the best of the
<>weapons he possessed. Indra gave him his weapon, the
<>S4akti, called Vaijayanti1 also. Karn2a had to use that [Page392-b+ 65]
<>weapon to kill the great Ghat2otkaca in the Maha1bha1-
<>rata battle.

<>incidents touching Karn2a during that period are given
<>below:
<NI>(i) Before the great war started Kunti1 went alone to
<>the shores of Gan3ga1 and met Karn2a. She then confessed
<>to him that she was his mother and that the Pa1n2d2avas
<>were his brothers. She advised Karn2a to join sides with
<>the Pa1n2d2avas and the Sun god approved of it. But
<>Karn2a refused to do so. He said he would never forsake
<>Duryodhana who had brought him up from his child-
<>hood at a time when he was in peril. But he promised

<>sons but would kill Arjuna in the battle-field. (Chapter

<HI>KA1RTAVI1RYA1RJUNA (KA1RTAVI1RYA). A renowned
<>King of the Hehaya dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Maha1vis2n2u were descended in the
<>following order: Brahma1--Atri--Candra--Budha--Puru1-
<>ravas--A1yus--Yaya1ti--Yadu--Sahasrajit--S4atajit--
<>Ekavi1ra--(Hehaya)--Dharma--Kan2i--Bhadrasena--
<>Dhanaka--Kr2tavi1rya--Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<NI>2) {%Hehaya Dynasty and Bha1rgava Dynasty.%} The Hehayas
<>were Ks2atriyas and the Bha1rgavas were Bra1hman2as.
<>The Bha1rgava sages were the family preceptors of the
<>Hehaya Kings. The Hehayas who were generous and
<>charitable, used to give plenty of wealth to the Bha1rga-
<>vas. Consequently in course of time, the Bha1rgavas
<>grew wealthy while the Hehayas gradually declined. In
<>order to tide over their difficulty, the Hehayas decided
<>to borrow some money from the Bha1rgavas. But the
<>Bha1rgavas refused to oblige, on the plea that they had
<>no money. The enraged Ks2atriyas (Hehayas) began to
<>persecute the Bhr2gus (Bha1rgavas). The Bhr2gus left for
<>the Hima1layas after burying all their treasures under
<>the floor of their A1s4ramas. The Ks2atriyas pursued
<>them and hunted them even there. At last a Bra1hman2i1
<>who belonged to the Bha1rgava race, gave birth to a
<>sage named Aurva through her thigh. With his birth
<>the Hehayas began to lead a less aggressive life. After
<>the lapse of many years, the mighty Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>was born in the Hehaya dynasty and the mighty sage
<>Jamadagni was born in the Bhr2gu dynasty. Both of
<>them nourished their hereditary feud. With his capital
<>in the city of Ma1his2mati1 on the banks of the river
<>Narmada1, Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna began his reign. (See
<>under Aurva I).
<NI>3) {%Thousand Hands of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.%} Once when
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was living in his capital Ma1his2mati1,
<>the sage Na1rada happened to come there. The King
<>greeted him with due reverence and asked him what
<>course of action was to be followed for attaining
<>moks2a (salvation) and at the same time for enjoying
<>worldly pleasures. Na1rada replied that by performing
<>the rite known as “Bhadradi1pa Pratis2t2ha1”, both these
<>objects could be achieved. Accordingly, Ka1rtavi1rya
<>went to the banks of the river Narmada1 with his wife [Page394-a+ 65]
<>and began the observance of Bhadradi1pa Pratis2t2ha1.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya's guru was Datta1treya, the son of Atri. At
<>the conclusion of the Ya1ga rites, Datta1treya who was
<>pleased, asked Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna what boons he wished
<>to have. Ka1rtavi1rya with joined palms asked him many
<>boons one of which was that he should have a thousand
<>arms. Datta1treya granted him the boons, and Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya who became proud of his new possession, ruled at
<>Ma1his2mati1 for 86, 000 years. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 44).
<NI>4) {%Va1yu's Warning.%} Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna who returned
<>triumphant after receiving the boon from Datta1treya
<>heard a mysterious voice warning him in the following
<>words:--“You fool! Don't you know that a Bra1hman2a
<>is superior to a Ks2atriya? A Ks2atriya governs his
<>subjects in alliance with the Bra1hman2a”. On hearing
<>this, Ka1rtavi1rya became angry. He understood that
<>Va1yu, the divine messenger was behind the mysterious
<>voice. He despised Va1yu and argued that a Ks2atriya
<>was superior to a Bra1hman2a. Va1yu gave him a warn-
<>ing that a Bra1hman2a would curse Ka1rtavi1rya. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 152).
<NI>5) {%Ka1rtavi1rya cursed by the sage.%} Once Agni (fire-god)
<>approached Ka1rtavi1rya and begged for food. The King
<>allowed him to feed upon mountains and trees from any
<>part of his Kingdom. So Agni began to devour the
<>woods and hills. This led to the burning down of an
<>A1s4rama owned by a sage called A1pava. The enraged
<>Sage came to know that Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was respon-
<>sible for the havoc and pronounced a curse that Paras4u-
<>ra1ma would chop off all the thousand hands of Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna.
<NI>6) {%Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and Ra1van2a.%} In the course of his
<>triumphal march, after conquering the whole world,
<>Ra1van2a once arrived with his forces on the bank of the
<>river Narmada1. Enjoying the smooth flow of the crystal
<>clear stream of the Narmada1 and the pleasant sand
<>banks in the river-bed, he spent a night there with his
<>followers. Early next morning he took his bath in the
<>river and setting up the idol of S4iva on the sand bank,
<>began to worship it.
<NI>Just then Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and his wives came to the
<>place and began their water sports, a few yards down
<>the river from the place where Ra1van2a was sitting. As
<>part of his amusements, Ka1rtavi1rya stopped the flow of
<>the river by making a dam with his thousand arms.
<>This caused the level of the water to rise and Ra1van2a
<>with his materials of worship was submerged in the
<>flood. Enraged at this disturbance to his worship, he
<>sent two of his men down the river bank to find out
<>what was happening. They traced the source of the
<>trouble to Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and his water-sports and
<>reported the matter to their master. At once Ra1van2a
<>armed himself with his bow rushed to Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>and began a fierce fight. At last Ra1van2a fell down under
<>the heavy stroke of Ka1rtavi1rya's mace and was bound
<>in chains and imprisoned. He lay there for one year.
<>Ra1van2a's father sage Pulastya came to know of this and
<>he went to Ka1rtavi1rya's palace. He was received with
<>due respect and at his request, Ka1rtavi1rya released
<>Ra1van2a and after that they remained friends for life.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>7) {%Ka1rtavi1rya and Ren2uka1's Death.%} One day when
<>Paras4ura1ma was fourteen years old, his father sage
<>Jamadagni went to the forest to fetch some Samits [Page394-b+ 65]
<>(sacrificial twigs). Jamadagni's wife, Ren2uka1 swept and
<>cleaned the A1s4rama and went to the river Reva1 to fetch
<>water and Paras4ura1ma was left behind in the A1s4rama.
<>When she reached the river bank, she saw Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>indulging in amorous pleasures with his wives in the
<>water. She waited unobserved on the bank for some
<>time and after they had left the place, she stepped into
<>the river. But since the water was muddy, she had to
<>go to another place in the river to get clear water.
<>There also she lingered for a few minutes, looking at
<>the amorous amusements of Citraratha, King of Sa1lva,
<>with his wives. It was only after they had departed
<>that she was able to return to the A1s4rama with water.
<>Meanwhile Jamadagni who had returned to the A1s4rama
<>earlier was angry at her delay and was waiting impatient-
<>ly for her arrival. As soon as she reached the A1s4rama,
<>the sage, in a fit of fury, ordered Paras4ura1ma to cut
<>off her head and the latter obeyed him. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 58).
<NI>8) {%The Triumphal March of Ka1rtavi1rya.%} All the Kings in
<>the world acknowledged the supremacy of Ka1rtavi1rya.
<>In Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 16, we find that Kings
<>of the Solar dynasty like Trayya1run2a, Haris4candra,
<>Rohita1s4va and Cun5cu were defeated by Ka1rtavi1rya1-
<>rjuna. In his golden chariot he went about defeating
<>Devas, Yaks2as, R2s2is and others. He challenged even
<>Vis2n2u. He insulted Indra in the company of Indra1n2i1.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 115).
<NI>Intoxicated by his successes, Ka1rtavi1rya went to the
<>sea-shore and challenged the ocean and began to des-
<>troy the animals in the sea by shooting them with his
<>arrows. God Varun2a appeared before him and asked
<>him what he wanted. Ka1rtavi1rya asked the god to
<>name a man who had the capacity to fight with him.
<>Varun2a answered that Jamadagni's son Paras4ura1ma
<>was the person who satisfied that condition. Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya accepted the challenge and went in search of
<>Paras4ura1ma. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 29).
<NI>9) {%Killing of Jamadagni.%} Once Ka1rtavi1rya went to
<>hunt in the forest with his followers. They were roam-
<>ing in the Vindhya forests in search of game. At noon
<>after a refreshing bath in the clear waters of the river
<>Narmada1 when they were preparing to return, they
<>saw Jamadagni's A1s4rama. After asking his men to wait
<>at the river-bank, Ka1rtavi1rya went alone to the
<>A1s4rama. He paid his respects to the sage and after
<>their usual greetings, Jamadagni asked him to call his
<>followers also to the A1s4rama. When all of them arrived
<>the sage gave them a sumptuous feast. Ka1rtavi1rya
<>wondered how the sage managed to do it. They spent
<>the night there and when they returned home next
<>morning Ka1rtavi1rya's minister Candragupta told him
<>that he saw a cow in Jamadagni's A1s4rama and that it
<>was from that divine cow that the sage was able to get
<>all the rare articles of food which he supplied to the
<>guests. He also offered to get the cow from the sage.
<>So the King sent Candragupta to the A1s4rama to beg
<>the cow from the sage for him. Candragupta accordingly
<>went with a few followers to the A1s4rama and begged
<>for the cow. At that time Paras4ura1ma was not in the
<>A1s4rama. Jamadagni told them that the cow was
<>Ka1madhenu's sister, Sus4i1la1 and that it was not possible
<>to give her. Candragupta tried to seize the cow by
<>force but she suddenly vanished into the sky. The
<>King's men tried to capture her calf. Jamadagni who [Page395-a+ 64]
<>came forward to prevent them, was beaten to death by
<>Candragupta. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapters 67 to
<>70).
<NI>10) {%Jamadagni's Restoration to Life.%} Paras4ura1ma
<>returned soon to the A1s4rama with the disciple Akr2ta-
<>vran2a. At the sight of his father lying dead on the floor,
<>Paras4ura1ma cried aloud. Ren2uka1 beat her breast
<>twentyone times. Seeing this, Paras4ura1ma took a
<>solemn vow that he would go round the world twenty-
<>one times and extirpate the Ks2atriya Kings. The sage
<>S4ukra appeared there with Sus4i1la1 who had vanished.
<>After restoring Jamadagni to life S4ukra went back.
<NI>11) {%Death of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.%} Paras4u Ra1ma who had
<>turned himself into the very embodiment of Revenge,
<>accompanied by Akr2tavran2a, took his stand at the gates
<>of the city of Ma1his2mati1 and challenged Ka1rtavi1r-
<>ya1rjuna to a fight. Ka1rtavi1rya came out with a huge
<>army. In the terrible fight that followed, Paras4ura1ma
<>himself with his axe (paras4u) chopped off all the
<>thousand arms of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. All his sons were
<>killed. Ka1rtavi1rya himself fell down beheaded. This
<>was the end of the pillar of Hehaya dynasty. (Brahma1-
<>n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 81).
<NI>12) {%Ka1rtavi1rya's sons.%} Ka1rtavirya had one hundred
<>sons. All of them were killed in the battle by Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. Their names, as given in Chapter 76 of

<HI>KARU1S2A (M). A place in ancient India. Historians
<>are of opinion that it is the Bundelkhan2d2a of modern
<>India. The sin of Brahmahatya1 (killing of brahmins)
<>of Indra was washed away by brahmins at this place.

<>Naraka1sura abducted Kas4eru when she was fourteen

<HI>KA1S4I1 I. (VA1RA1N2ASI1. BANARAS). (See under Divo-
<>da1sa also).
<NI>1) {%General.%} One of the oldest and most popular
<>sacred centres in India, Ka1s4i1 is reputed for its Vis4va-
<>na1tha temple of hoary traditions, according to one of
<>which the S4ivalin3ga in the temple was installed by
<>Brahma1 himself. (Ha1la1sya Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>2) {%Pilgrimage on foot to Ka1s4i1.%} Devotees from many
<>parts of India go on pilgrimage to Ka1s4i1 on foot, bathe
<>in the holy waters of the Gan3ga1 and thus earn spiritual
<>satisfaction and release from worldly attachments. The
<>reason for the above is stated in the Agni Pura1n2a as
<>follows:-- Once, at Kaila1sa S4iva told Pa1rvati1 that the
<>temple at Ka1s4i1 was called ‘Avimukta’ (unreleased) as
<>it never perished, and all Japa, tapa, homa and da1na
<>made there never cease to give auspicious results. One
<>should walk on foot to Ka1s4i1 and live there. Having
<>gone there one should never leave the place. There are
<>eight great ti1rthas at Avimukta, i.e. Haris4candra ti1rtha,
<>A1vra1takes4vara ti1rtha, Japyes4vara ti1rtha, S4ri1 Parva-
<>ti1rtha, Maha1layati1rtha, Bhr2gu ti1rtha, Can2d2es4vara
<>ti1rtha and Keda1rati1rtha. These ti1rthas extend to two
<>yojanas to the east of the Ka1s4i1 temple and half-a-
<>yojana to the west of it. The river Varan2a1 is also there,
<>and Va1ra1n2asi1 is at the centre of all these. Whatever is
<>done at Va1ra1n2asi1 like bath, Japa, homa, worship of
<>Devas, da1na, obsequies for the dead, oneself living there
<>etc. is productive of devotion and salvation. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 112).

<HI>KA1S4YA I. A famous King of Ka1s4i1; father of Amba1,
<>Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. He was also called Krodha-
<>vas4a. According to Chapter 171 of Udyoga Parva,
<>Kas4ya's real name was Sena1bindu.
<HI>KA1S4YA II. One of the great sages who visited Bhi1s2ma
<>on his bed of arrows. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 47,
<>Verse 10).
<HI>KAS4YAPA I. Chief among the Praja1patis.
<NI>1) {%Kas4yapa--Son or Grandson of Brahma1?%} It is impossible
<>to give a definite answer to this question. In Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65, we see that six spirit-
<>ual sons--Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pul{??}aha and
<>Kratu--were born to Brahma1. Kas4yapa was born as
<>the son of Mari1ci and that all living beings in the
<>world took their origin from Kas4yapa. According to
<>this statement, Kas4yapa is the grandson of Brahma1. [Page396-b+ 65]
<>But in the 14th Sarga of Aran2yaka1n2d2a in Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a there is an account of the creation of all
<>animate and inanimate objects in this world. According
<>to a statement in that passage, we find that Kas4yapa
<>was the youngest brother of Mari1ci, Atri, Pulastya and
<>others. This means that Kas4yapa was the son of Brahma1.
<>Therefore there is nothing wrong in regarding him
<>either as the son or as the grandson of Brahma1. In the
<>Pura1n2as we find references to him in both ways.
<NI>2) {%Original Gotra or Clan.%} Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 297, verse 17 says that all living beings belong
<>to the four original Gotras--the gotra of An3giras,
<>Kas4yapa gotra, Bhr2gu gotra and Vasis2t2ha gotra and
<>that all the other gotras came into existence subse-
<>quently.
<NI>3) {%Kas4yapa's wives.%} Kas4yapa had 21 wives who were:--
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Aris2t2a1, Surasa1. Khas4a1, Surabhi,
<>Vinata1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Ira1, Kadru1, Muni,
<>Puloma1, Ka1laka1, Nata1, Dana1yus, Sim3hika1, Pradha1,
<>Vis4va1, and Kapila1. Of these, the 13 wives, Aditi, Diti,
<>Ka1laka1, Dana1yus, Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pradha1,
<>Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1, Muni and Kadru1, were the
<>daughters of Daks2a.
<NI>Of these the first wife Aditi had 12 sons. These 12 sons
<>namely Vis2n2u, S4akra, Aryama1, Dha1ta1, Tvas2t2a1, Pu1s2a1,
<>Vivasva1n, Savita1, Mitra, Varun2a, Am3s4a and Bhaga are
<>called A1dityas (sons of Aditi). In the sixth Manvantara
<>these 12 A1dityas belonged to the tribe known as Tus2itas.
<>(The present Manvantara is the seventh one). The 33
<>crores of Devas came into being from the twelve
<>A1dityas.
<NI>The Daityas were born from Kas4yapa's second wife
<>Diti. The chief Daityas are Hiran2yakas4ipu, Hiran2ya1ks2a
<>and Sim3hika1. All the other Daityas were born from
<>them.
<NI>The Da1navas were the children of Danu, another wife
<>of Kas4yapa. Dvimu1rdha1, S4ambara, Ayomukha, S4an3ku-
<>s4iras, Kapila, S4an3kara, Ekacakra, Maha1ba1hu, Ta1raka,
<>Maha1bala, Svarbha1nu, Vr2s2aparva1, Puloma1, and Vipra-
<>citti are the famous Da1navas. The other Da1navas were
<>the children of the people mentioned above.
<NI>Another wife of Kas4yapa, Surabhi gave birth to Aja,
<>Ekapa1d, Ahirbuddhnya, Tvas2t2a1 and Rudra and also
<>the Eka1das4a Rudras namely:--Hara, Bahuru1pa, Tryam-
<>baka, Apara1jita, Vr2s2a1kapi, S4ambhu, Kapardi1, Raivata,
<>Mr2gavya1dha, Sarpa, and Kapa1li1. Vinata1 gave birth to
<>Garud2a and Kadru1 was the mother of the na1gas. The
<>Pura1n2as proclaim that all living beings that we see in
<>the world today, sprang from Kas4yapa's offsprings by
<>his different wives. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a,
<>Chapter 29; Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part I, Chapters 15-21;
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapters 16 and 65 and
<>Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 18).
<NI>4) {%Brahma1 taught Kas4yapa cure for snake poison.%} The ser-
<>pents (Na1gas) were born to Kadru1, one of the wives
<>of Kas4yapa. Once Kadru1 asked her children to hang
<>down like hair from the tail of Uccais4s4ravas. They
<>refused to do so. Kadru1 became angry and cursed them
<>that they would be burnt alive at Janamejaya's Sarpa
<>Sattra (snake-sacrifice). After the curse, the Na1gas
<>became dangerously venomous. At this stage, Brahma1
<>taught Kas4yapa the art of curing snake-poison to
<>protect other creatures that might be bitten by the
<>Na1gas. Cure of snake-bite in this world dates from
<>that time. (M.B. A1di Parva. Chapter 20). [Page397-a+ 65]
<NI>5) {%Kas4y pa and Garud2a.%} Garud2a is a mighty son of
<>Kas4yapa by his wife Vinata1. Vinata1 made a bet with
<>her sister Kadru1. Kadru1 won the bet. Vinata1 became
<>Kadru1's maid-servant as a result of the bet. To be
<>relieved of this bondage Vinata1's son Garud2a had to
<>bring Amr2ta from Devaloka and give it to Kadru1 and
<>her Na1ga-sons. Garud2a agreed and flew up to Heaven
<>to fetch Amr2ta.
<NI>On the way, he visited his father Kas4yapa who was
<>performing penance on the Gandhama1dana mountain.
<>He asked his father to give him some food, as he was
<>very hungry. Kas4yapa told him the following story:--
<>“Long ago a sage named Vibha1vasu lived near this place.
<>He and his younger brother named Suprati1ka began to
<>quarrel over the sharing of their father's wealth. The
<>elder brother transformed the younger brother into an
<>elephant by a curse and the younger brother turned
<>the elder into a tortoise by his curse. They are still
<>living in yonder lake as elephant and tortoise and
<>continue like enemies. If you eat both of them, you will
<>be strong enough to fight against the Devas and get
<>possession of Amr2ta for yourself.”
<NI>On hearing this, Garud2a went to the lake and caught
<>the elephant and tortoise in his claws and flew up into
<>the sky. The mountains began to tremble and a whirl-
<>wind swept the Heavens when Garud2a beat with his
<>wings. He flew about here and there unable to find a
<>convenient place to sit and enjoy his meal. On the way,
<>his eye caught sight of a huge banyan tree spreading its
<>branches far and wide, to a distance of 100 yojanas
<>around it. When he perched on one of its branches
<>with the elephant and tortoise, the branch broke and
<>fell down. From that branch certain sages known as
<>Ba1lakhilyas were hanging with their heads downwards.
<>So, to prevent them from falling to the ground, Garud2a
<>lifted it in his beak and began to fly up again. Unable
<>to find a suitable spot where he could deposit the
<>branch with the sages, Garud2a returned to his father
<>again. At the request of Kas4yapa, the Ba1lakhilyas went
<>to the Hima1layas. He showed Garud2a a vast, snow-
<>clad mountain on which he could deposit the broken
<>branch he was carrying. Garud2a flew to that mountain
<>and ate up the elephant and tortoise and thus gained
<>strength to fight with the Devas for Amr2ta. After that
<>he proceeded to Heaven. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters
<>29-31).
<NI>6) {%Other Birth of Kas4yapa.%} In Ca1ks2us2a Manvantara, the
<>sage Sutapas performed a penance along with his wife
<>Pr2s4ni for 12,000 years. Lord Vis2n2u appeared to them
<>and asked what boon they wished to ask. They prayed
<>that the Lord should take birth as their son. Vis2n2u
<>granted their prayer and was born as their son.
<NI>In the next Manvantara (the period of Vaivasvata
<>Manu) Sutapas and Pr2s4ni were re-born as Kas4yapa
<>and Aditi respectively. At that time also Maha1vis2n2u
<>was born to Aditi as Va1mana. (See under Va1mana).
<>In this birth, Kas4yapa had many other wives besides
<>Aditi. Surasa1 was one of those wives. (Bha1gavata, 10th
<>Skandha).
<NI>It was this Kas4yapa himself who was reborn as Vasu-
<>deva and Aditi became Devaki1. Surasa1 was born as
<>Rohin2i1, another wife. There is another reason for
<>Kas4yapa and Aditi to take birth for the third time.
<>Once Kas4yapa had prepared to perform a Ya1ga. All
<>arrangements were complete. But the sacrificial cow [Page397-b+ 64]
<>alone was not available. Kas4yapa solved the problem
<>by stealing a cow from Varun2a's cattle-shed. Aditi and
<>Surasa1 concealed it in the A1s4rama. Enraged at the
<>theft of his cow, Varun2a complained to Brahma1. A
<>curse was pronounced by Brahma1 and Varun2a that as
<>a punishment for stealing and hiding the cow, Kas4yapa
<>should be reborn as a cowherd and Aditi and Surasa1
<>should be reborn as the cowherd's wives. It was by
<>this curse that Kas4yapa, Aditi and Surasa1 were reborn
<>as Vasudeva Devaki1 and Rohin2i1 respectively. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<NI>7) {%Paras4ura1ma's gift of land to Kas4yapa.%} Paras4ura1ma
<>performed a Ya1ga after exterminating all Ks2atriya
<>Kings. At that Ya1ga he gifted all the lands he had
<>conquered till then to Kas4yapa. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 117, there is a reference to this
<>gift.
<NI>8) {%Kas4yapa and Kerala.%} After Paras4ura1ma went round
<>the world eighteen times and exterminated the
<>Ks2atriya Kings he performed a Ya1ga. At that Ya1ga he
<>gave the whole earth as daks2in2a1 to Kas4yapa. After that,
<>Kas4yapa drove away Paras4ura1ma from the earth to
<>the south. Taking pity on Paras4ura1ma, the ocean gave
<>him the region known as “S4u1rpa1raka”. Kas4yapa seized
<>S4u1rpa1raka also from Paras4ura1ma and gave it to
<>Bra1hman2as. Paras4ura1ma went to the forests after it.
<>Later on, intermixture of castes took place in this region
<>and anarchy prevailed there. At one time, S4u1rpa1raka
<>sank down into Pa1ta1la (lower world). Kas4yapa who
<>saw this held the earth up, brought Ks2atriyas from the
<>north and made them rulers of the country. (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 49). This “S4u1rpa1raka” is believed
<>to be Kerala.
<NI>9) {%Other Details about Kas4yapa.%}
<NI>(i) Kas4yapa arrived at the place of Arjuna's birth
<>accompanied by other sages. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 122).
<NI>(ii) Kas4yapa flourished in Brahma1's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11).
<NI>(iii) Once there was a dispute between Virocana, the
<>son of Prahla1da and Sudhanva1, the son of An3giras. It
<>was Kas4yapa who settled this dispute. (See the 5th
<>Para under the word An3giras).
<NI>(iv) Once Kas4yapa went on a pilgrimage in the
<>company of Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>85).
<NI>(v) Once Brahma1 gifted the entire earth to Kas4yapa
<>at a Yajn5a. Bhu1midevi1 (Goddess of the earth) who
<>was distressed at it, went to Pa1ta1la and began to
<>lament. At that time Kas4yapa propitiated the goddess
<>by his austere penance. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>114).
<NI>(vi) After Paras4ura1ma had given the entire earth to
<>Kas4yapa, Kas4yapa drove away Paras4ura1ma from the
<>earth. Paras4ura1ma then shot an arrow into the sea
<>and converted that portion of the sea into land. (M.B.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 70, Verses 18 and 19).
<NI>(vii) When the war between Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas
<>was in progress, Kas4yapa approached Dron2a and
<>wanted him to bring the battle to a close. (M.B.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 190).
<NI>(viii) Kas4yapa was also present with other sages at
<>the time of Skanda's birth. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>45). [Page398-a+ 65]
<NI>(ix) Kas4yapa once gave some pieces of advice to
<>Puru1ravas. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 73).
<NI>(x) In the 8th verse of Chapter 208 of S4a1nti Parva, in
<>Maha1bha1rata, we find that Kas4yapa had another name
<>Aris2t2anemi.
<NI>(xi) Kas4yapa once related to Bhi1s2ma, the story of
<>Maha1vis2n2u's Vara1ha1vata1ra. (Incarnation as Boar).
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 209, Verse 6).
<NI>(xii) Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata says that gingelly seeds were first
<>introduced into this world from sage Kas4yapa's body.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 10).
<NI>(xiii) Kas4yapa explained to Vr2s2a1darbhi, the evil of
<>receiving pratigraha (presents). (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 93).
<NI>(xiv) Kas4yapa once spoke to Arundhati1 about the
<>weakness of his body. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>93, Verse 65).
<NI>(xv) At another time, Agastya suspected that Kas4yapa
<>had stolen his lotus. But Kas4yapa swore that he was
<>innocent. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 94).
<NI>(xvi) In Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata it is said that Kas4yapa was
<>one of the Sapta Gurus (seven Preceptors) of Kubera.
<>The other six Gurus were--Vasis2t2ha, Atri, Gautama,
<>Bharadva1ja, Vis4va1mitra and Jamadagni. M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 150).
<NI>(xvii) In Bha1gavata we see that Kas4yapa and other
<>sages were instrumental in bringing about the destruc-
<>tion of Yadu Vam3s4a. (For further details see under
<>SA1MBA).
<HI>KAS4YAPA II. A serpent. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 122, we read that this serpent was present at
<>the time of Arjuna's birth.
<HI>KA1S4YAPA I. (KAN2VA).
<NI>1) {%General.%} Two sages Kas4yapa and Ka1s4yapa are mention-
<>ed in the Pura1n2as, and due to the close similarity in
<>the names in some Pura1n2as the two names are used one
<>for the other. There is, therefore, considerable difficulty
<>in distinguishing the one from the other and unerringly
<>hitting upon the right person in certain contexts.
<P>There is a very ancient sage the first cause or the
<>original father of all living beings in the universe. He
<>is described, in most of the Pura1n2as, as the grandson of
<>Brahma1 and the son of Mari1ci. He was the husband of
<>the original or first mothers of living beings, called Diti
<>and Aditi. The interpretation that he was called Kas4ya-
<>pa as he used to drink Kas4yam (liquor) is not founded
<>on facts. No Pura1n2a refers to him as a drunkard.
<P>The sage called Ka1s4yapa was the foster father of
<>S4akuntala1. The statement that he was called Ka1s4yapa
<>as he was born in the dynasty of Kas4yapa is also not
<>correct. Kan2va was not born in the dynasty of Kas4yapa.
<>The genealogy of Ka1s4yapa is as follows:
<NI>2). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1--
<>Atri--Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a--
<>Yaya1ti--Puru--Janamejaya--Pra1cinva1n--Pravi1ra--
<>Namasyu--Vi1tabhaya--S4un2d2u--Bahuvidha--Sam3ya1ti
<>-Rahova1di1--Raudra1s4va--Matina1ra--Pri1tiratha--
<>Medha1tithi--Kan2va (Ka1s4yapa).
<NI>Medha1tithi was Kan2va's father. (S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 208, Verse 27). According to the Agni
<>Pura1n2a a son called Kan2va was born (Ka1s4yapa)
<>to Medha1tithi, son of King Pri1tiratha of the Puru
<>dynasty. But, nothing about the family matters of
<>Kan2va is mentioned therein. In the Maha1bha1rata itself
<>the name Ka1s4yapa is often used instead of Kan2va. [Page398-b+ 65]
<>From the above facts it may be understood that Kan2va
<>was born as a prince, and that later on, he became a
<>sage. Moreover, the Agni Pura1n2a says that Santurodha,
<>the brother of Kan2va's father, was the father of Dus2yan-
<>ta. According to that Ka1s4yapa and Dus2yanta were the
<>sons of brothers, Ka1s4yapa being that of the elder one.
<>For the time being the above are the only reasonable
<>inferences, and the truth has to be found out by further
<>researches. But, one thing is certain according to the
<>genealogy, that Ka1s4yapa was born twenty generations
<>after Kas4yapa.
<NI>3). {%Ka1s4yapa and Taks2aka.%} The story is told in the 2nd
<>Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata and in the A1di Parva of
<>Bha1rata that Taks2aka set out to bite King Pari1ks2it and
<>Ka1s4yapa to cure him of Taks2aka's poison, but that
<>Taks2aka bribed Ka1s4yapa off his mission to save the
<>King. But, the story as such is unfounded. It was Kas4-
<>yapa and not Ka1s4yapa whom Brahma1 had taught the
<>science of the treatment and cure of poison (see under
<>Kas4yapa) and, therefore, it should be Kas4yapa whom
<>Taks2aka bribed.
<NI>4). {%Kas4yapa and S4akuntala1.%} See under KA. VA.
<NI>5). {%Ka1s4yapa and R2s2yas4r2n3ga.%} Father of R2s2yas4r2n3ga was
<>one Ka1s4yapa; may be Kas4yapa or Ka1s4yapa. The great-
<>er possibility is for Ka1s4yapa to be the father. (See
<>under R2S2YAS4R2N3GA).
<NI>6). After a Yajn5a Vis4vakarman made a land-gift to
<>Ka1s4yapa once. (See under KAN2VA).
<HI>KA1S4YAPA II. Priest of Vasudeva; this Ka1s4yapa lived
<>for years as a good friend of the Pa1n2d2avas. He is consi-
<>dered to be a very distinguished ascetic. (As4vamedha
<>Parva, Chapter 16).
<HI>KA1S4YAPA III. Son of Sage Kas4yapa. This Ka1s4yapa was
<>member of Indra's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7).
<>He was present at the Yajn5a conducted by emperor
<>Pr2thu.
<HI>KA1S4YAPA IV. An Agni, the son of Kas4yapa. Pa1n5cajan2ya
<>was born from the five Agnis, Ka1s4yapa, Vasis2t2ha,
<>Pra1n2a, An3giras and Cyavana, all of whom were sons of
<>Kas4yapa. (Vana Parva, Chapter 220).
<HI>KA1S4YAPA V. A haughty Vais4ya once felled to the
<>ground a brahmin youth called Ka1s4yapa by hitting him
<>with his chariot. (See under Indra, Para 38).
<HI>KA1S4YAPA VI. Sons of Kas4yapa like Vibha1n2d2aka.
<>Ra1jadharman, Vis4va1vasu, Indra, A1ditya and Vasu,

<>of a hare visible in the moon. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chap-
<>ter 6, Verse 55).
<HI>KA1S4YAPI1. (Earth). The earth came to be known as
<>Ka1s4yapi1 as it had been given as a gift to Kas4yapa by
<>Paras4ura1ma.
<NI>“The whole of the earth was given to Kas4yapa and thus
<>it came to be called Ka1s4yapi1”. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,

<HI>KATHA1SARITSA1GARA. See under BR2HATRATHA1.
<HI>KAT2HOPANIS2AD. See under NACIKETAS.
<HI>KAT2VA1KU (KHAT2VA1KU). A son of Vaivasvata Manu.
<>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a states that he was an ancestor of
<>Iks2va1ku.
<NI>In the beginning Manu, alias Vaivasvata, had a son
<>named Kat2va1ku. He was the first of kings and he ruled [Page399-a+ 65]
<>the world for a long time. On the banks of the river
<>Sarayu1 he constructed a city called Ayodhya1. Ayodhya1
<>was celebrated for its beauty and wise men proclaimed
<>that it was more beautiful than the cities of the eight
<>guards of the universe or the city of even Brahma1, the

<>of Vicitravi1rya, but on the way knowing that Amba1 was
<>in love with the King of S4a1lva, she was sent back.
<>Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 became the wives of Vicitravi1rya.
<>Shortly Vicitravi1rya also died. With a view to continue
<>the royal family, Satyavati1 sent for Vya1sa, so that he
<>might beget children of Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. At
<>the time of coition Ambi1ka1 closed her eyes to avoid
<>seeing the uncouth face of Vya1sa. So she got as son
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra who was blind from birth. Seeing the ugly
<>figure of Vya1sa Amba1lika1 turned pale and so the son
<>born to her was pale in colour. He was called Pa1n2d2u.
<>From Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Duryodhana and his brothers were
<>born and from Pa1n2d2u were born the Pa1n2d2avas. All

<>known by the name ‘Kauravas’.
<NI>2) {%The origin of Kauravas.%} (Duryodhana and his bro-
<>thers). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra married Ga1ndha1ri1 the daughter of
<>Subala the King of Ga1ndha1ra. Once Vya1sa reached the
<>palace weary with hunger and thirst. Ga1ndha1ri1 gave
<>Vya1sa food and drink. Vya1sa was pleased with her and
<>told her that she might ask for any boon. She said that
<>she wanted to get hundred sons from Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>Vya1sa granted the boon. Ga1ndha1ri1 became pregnant.
<>Even after two years she did not deliver. She heard that
<>Kunti1, the wife of Pa1n2d2u had given birth to a child.
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 became sad. She crushed her womb and gave
<>birth to a lump of flesh. Understanding this, Vya1sa
<>came there and cutting the lump into hundred and one
<>pieces kept them in ghee-pots. Advising Ga1ndha1ri1 to
<>keep the pots in secret, Vya1sa went to the Hima1layas.
<>The pots were broken at the proper time and hundred
<>sons and a daughter came out. Besides them Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra had another son named Yuyutsu by a Vais4ya
<>woman.

<HI>KAUS4IKA IV. While the Pa1n2d2avas were leading forest
<>life, the hermit Ma1rkan2d2eya told the story of a noble
<>Brahmin named Kaus4ika, to Dharmaputra. Once this [Page400-b+ 65]
<>Brahmin sat under a tree and performed penance. A small
<>crane which sat on a branch of the tree passed excreta
<>on the head of the Brahmin. He became angry and
<>looked at the bird. Instantly the bird was reduced to
<>ashes. The Brahmin sincerely repented and went to the
<>countryside to live on alms. Once he reached the house
<>of a Brahmin. The wife of the Brahmin came to the
<>door and requested him to wait a bit. Immediately her
<>husband arrived, and she, being engaged in looking
<>after the needs of her husband forgot the Brahmin
<>Kaus4ika, who became angry and spoke cruel words to
<>her. She argued that the noblest deed was looking after
<>one's husband and that it was not meet and right for
<>Brahmins to get angry. She advised Kaus4ika to go to
<>Mithila1puri1 and to receive advice from the famous
<>Dharmavya1dha. Kaus4ika repented his rash nature,
<>went to Dharmavya1dha and received advice from him.
<>He returned home and lived peacefully with his parents.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, ten chapters from 206).
<NI>Though a man of veracity, he finally had to go to hell,
<>for the following reason. While he was engaged in
<>penance in the forest some thieves came by that way with
<>some stolen goods. The owners of the goods were chasing
<>the thieves. Kaus4ika told them the way by which the
<>thieves had gone. So at the end Kaus4ika was thrown
<>into hell. (M.B. Karn2a Parva, Chapter 69).
<HI>KAUS4IKA V. A King of the Puru dynasty. Kapila was
<>his father and Gr2tsapati was his brother. The four
<>castes Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra originat-
<>ed from Gr2tsapati. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 278).
<HI>KAUS4IKA VI. A hermit. This ancient hermit lived in
<>Kuruks2etra. His sons Svasr2pa, Krodhana, Him3sra,
<>Pis4una, Kavi, Va1gdus2t2a, and Pitr2vartti1 lived with
<>hermit Garga for learning under him. Their names
<>indicated their character. Their father died. The sons
<>were in poverty. At this time rain ceased altogether.
<>Garga asked his disciples to take his milch cow to the
<>forest for grazing. Owing to hunger the brothers decid-
<>ed to kill and eat the cow. But the youngest said: “If
<>you are bent on killing the cow, we had better make
<>use of it as an offering to the Manes, and no sin will
<>visit us.”
<NI>All agreed to this and Pitr2vartti1 killed the cow and
<>began the sacrifice. Two elder brothers were employed
<>in worshipping the gods and three were detailed to give
<>offerings to the manes. One was asked to be the guest.
<>Pitr2vartti1 was the sacrificer. Remembering the
<>ancestors with reverence he began the sacrifice in
<>accordance with the rites. Thus the seven hermits ate
<>the cow and told Garga that the cow was caught by a
<>tiger.
<NI>In due course the seven of them died, and took rebirth
<>as rude low-caste people in Da1s4apura. Because of the
<>sacrifice and offerings to the Manes they had the
<>remembrance of their previous birth. So they feared
<>god and took fast and vow at a holy bath and in the
<>presence of a multitude cast off their lives and were
<>born again as animals in Ka1lan5jara hills. Because of
<>their abstinence due to knowledge they cast off their
<>lives by Prapatana (jumping down from the top of the
<>mountain) and were born again as Ruddy geese, in the
<>Ma1nasasaras whentheir names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<>Vasu, Citradars4i1, Sudars4i1, Jn5a1ta1 and Jn5a1napa1raga--
<>names conforming to their character. The seven brothers
<>became pure and sinless by their union with God the [Page401-a+ 65]
<>Supreme Spirit. But three of them fell out of the union
<>because of their desire. They saw the pleasurable life
<>led by An2uha the King of Pa1n5ca1la who was immensely
<>wealthy with many beautiful wives. At the sight of this,
<>one of the geese--the Brahmin Pitr2vartti, who performed
<>the sacrifice of offering to the Manes because of his love
<>for his father--wished to become a king. Seeing the two
<>wealthy ministers who led luxurious lives, two of the
<>ruddy geese wanted to become ministers. Accordingly
<>Pitr2vartti was born as Brahmadatta the son of Vaibh-
<>ra1ja and the other two as sons of ministers with names
<>Pun2d2ari1ka and Suba1laka. Brahmadatta was anointed
<>as King of Pa1n5ca1la in the great city of Ka1mpilya. That
<>King was mighty, loving his father well, always desirous
<>of giving offerings to Manes and harmonious with God,
<>having the ability to read the hearts of every living
<>being. He married Sannati the daughter of Sudeva.
<>This woman in her previous birth was the cow of
<>Garga. As this cow was used as offering to the Manes
<>she got rebirth as a religious-minded woman and be-
<>came the queen of Brahmadatta, who ruled over the
<>kingdom well for a long time.
<NI>Once the King and the queen were walking in the
<>garden when they saw two ants which were quarrelling
<>with each other. They were husband and wife. After
<>a time the quarrel ended and they grew more loving
<>than before and the she-ant pressed closely against her
<>husband. Brahmadatta hearing their conversation stood
<>smiling. He could understand the language of every
<>living being because of the merits of his previous births.
<>When the King smiled his wife asked him for the rea-
<>son. He described to his wife the quarrel of the ant-
<>couple. The queen did not believe his words. She
<>thought that the King had been making fun of her.
<>She asked him how he learned the language of birds
<>and beasts. But the King could not give an answer and
<>he became thoughtful. The remaining four of the ruddy
<>geese took rebirth as the sons of a poor Brahmin in the
<>same city of Ka1mpilya. They had the remembrance of
<>previous births. Their names were Dhr2tima1n, Sarva-
<>dars4i1, Vidya1candra and Tapodhika, names befitting
<>their character. They decided to perform severe penance
<>to attain Supreme bliss, and were about to get away
<>from the house when their father, the poor Brahmin
<>cried bitterly, being helpless. They taught their father
<>the following poem and advised him to recite the poem
<>before the King the next morning, in order to get plenty
<>of wealth.
<Poem>“Noble Brahmins in Kuruks2etra
<>The seven foresters in Da1s4apura
<>Deer in Ka1lan5jara and in Ma1nasa
<>Ruddy geese, the same now are men.”</Poem>
<>Brahmadatta who was not able to give answer to the
<>question of his wife, was about to go out from the palace
<>for a walk with his wife and ministers, when the old brah-
<>min made his appearance and recited the poem taught
<>by his sons, to the King. When the King heard the
<>stanza he remembered the previous births and fainted
<>and fell down. The two ministers, Suba1laka son of
<>Ba1bhravya the author of the science of love and Pun2d2a-
<>ri1ka son of Pa1n5ca1la the author of the science of medicine
<>and treatment, also remembered about their previous
<>births and fell down with grief. The three of them
<>lamented about their fall from the union with the Sup-
<>reme Spirit. Brahmadatta gave that old Brahmin plenty [Page401-b+ 65]
<>of wealth and villages and sent him away contented.
<>After anointing his son Vis2vaksena as King, Brahmadatta
<>and his retinue went to Ma1nasasaras for penance.
<>For a while they lived in the forest engaged in penance
<>and then cast off their lives and entered the world of
<>Supreme bliss. (Padma Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 10).
<HI>KAUS4IKA VII. A King. This king became a cock at
<>night. His wife Vis4a1la1 was filled with grief at this
<>transfiguration of her husband in the night. She
<>told her grief to the hermit Ga1lava who told the queen
<>about the previous birth of her husband as follows:--
<>“In the previous birth he used to eat cocks to get
<>strength. Knowing this Ta1mracu1d2a the king of fowls
<>cursed him. “You shall become a cock during nights.”
<>That is why your husband has become a cock.”
<>According to the advice of the hermit the King began
<>to worship Lord S4iva and he was liberated from the
<>curse. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>KAUS4IKA1. (GOMATI1). A river. The hermitage of
<>Vis4va1mitra stood on the bank of this river. The modern
<>name of river Kaus4ika1 is Kosi1. The river Kosi1 flows

<>obtain remission of sins. See under Gomati1. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 84).
<HI>KAUS4IKA1CA1RYA. The king A1kr2iti. It is mentioned in

<>in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 84 that if a
<>man fasts in this place, the confluence of Kaus4iki1 and
<>Arun2a1 rivers he will be absolved of all his sins.
<HI>KAUSTUBHA. A brilliant precious stone. It is mention-
<>ed in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 3; Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a Sarga 45, Stanza 39 and Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva that this precious stone floated up at the time of
<>the churning of the sea of Milk. This jewel which
<>originated from the ghee in the sea of Milk, was worn
<>on the breast by Vis2n2u.
<>“This divine jewel called Kaustubha came up in the
<>middle of ghee and stayed in the breast of Vis2n2u,
<>spreading its rays everywhere.” (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<NI>KAUTHUMI. Son of a Brahmin named Hiran2ya-
<>na1bha. Once this Brahmin youth went to the hermitage
<>of King Janaka and entered into a controversy with the
<>Brahmins there. In the argument Kauthumi became
<>angry and killed a Brahmin. From that day he became
<>a leper. The sin of Brahmahatya1 (murder of Brahmin)
<>also followed him. Finally according to the advice of
<>his father he worshipped the sun God, with S4ra1vya-
<>sam3jn5akasu1kta (a spell or incantation) and by the
<>blessing of the Sun God he got deliverance from the
<>sin of Brahmahatya1 and the disease of leprosy. (Bhavi-
<>s2ya Pura1n2a, Bra1hma Parva).
<HI>KAUT2ILYA. See under Ca1n2akya.
<HI>KAUTSA. A noble Brahmin scholar. He was present at
<>the sarpa-sattra (sacrificial fire to kill serpents) of [Page402-a+ 61]
<>Janamejaya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 6).
<HI>KAUTSYA (KAUTSA). A hermit who was the disciple
<>of Varatantu. When he had completed his education
<>he asked his teacher what gift he desired. The teacher
<>said that he wanted fourteen crores of gold coins as
<>gift. Kautsya approached the emperor Raghu. The
<>emperor had just finished a sacrifice called Vis4vajit and
<>had emptied his treasury by giving away all the
<>wealth he had as alms. Only pots made of wood were
<>left as his wealth. When the emperor heard about the
<>need of Kautsya he decided to conquer the capital city
<>of Kubera. That night Kubera filled the treasury of
<>Raghu by a shower of gold. The emperor Raghu gave
<>Kautsya fourteen crores of gold coins. (Raghuvam3s4a).
<HI>KAVACA. A sage in the assembly of Indra. (M.B.

<HI>KAVACI1. One of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 103). In Maha1bha1rata,

<>by Bhi1masena.
<HI>KA1VERI1. A holy river in South India. Famous sacred
<>places like S4ri1ran3ga and Kumbhakon2a are on its banks.
<>The Devi1 of the river lives in Varun2a's assembly
<>worshipping him. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 20).
<>The Skanda Pura1n2a has the following story as to how
<>Ka1veri1 came down to earth:
<>Once Agastya propitiated S4iva at Kaila1sa and sought
<>the boon of some water for him to found a sacred place
<>on earth. At the same time Ka1veri1 also was worship-
<>ping S4iva. S4iva filled Agastya's bowl with Ka1veri1 water.
<>Agastya, on his way back from Kaila1sa cursed the
<>Ra1ks2asa called Kraun5ca and kicked the Vindhya
<>mountain down. (See under Agastya). After over-
<>coming various difficulties Agastya at last reached
<>South India. He sat in meditation with the bowl of
<>Ka1veri1 water before him, and then, at the request of
<>Indra, Gan2apati, in the guise of a crow came and sat
<>on the brink of the bowl and upset it. The water in
<>the bowl flowed as a river, and that river is the
<>present Ka1veri1. (Asuraka1n2d2a, Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>KAVI. I. A son of Vaivasvata Manu. Vivasva1n was the

<HI>KAVI II. There is a reference to a sage named Kavi
<>who was the son of the sage Bhr2gu, in Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 42,. He was among the
<>sages who stole the lotus of Agastya. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 32).
<HI>KAVI III. An agni who was the fifth son of Br2haspati,
<>is named Kavi. This agni is situated in the sea in the
<>form of Bad2ava1gni. This agni has two other names
<>also--Uda1ha and U1rddhvabha1k. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 219, Verse 20).
<HI>KAVI IV. In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Verse
<>132, Chapter 85, we find that three persons, namely,
<>Kavi, Bhr2gu and An3giras took their birth from the [Page402-b+ 65]
<>sacrificial fire at the famous Ya1ga of Brahma1. Of them
<>Brahma1 made Kavi his own son. This Kavi had eight
<>sons known as the Varun2as. One of them was named
<>Kavi and another was named Ka1vya.
<HI>KAVI V. R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 17th Anuva1ka. 116th
<>Su1kta refers to a blind sage named Kavi.
<HI>KAVIRA1JA. A Sanskrit poet who lived in India in the
<>12th Century A.D. His chief works are “Ra1ghavapa1n2d2a-
<>vi1ya” and “Pa1rija1taharan2a”. His real name was
<>Ma1dhavabhat2t2a.
<HI>KAVIS2A. A sage. There was a person named Kavis2a
<>among the sages who came to visit S4ri1 Ra1ma when he

<>came there from the western country were, Vr2s2an3gu,
<>Kavis2a, Dhaumya, Raudreya, Na1rada, Va1madeva,

<>Maudgalya. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>KA1VYA. Son of Kavi, one of the Praja1patis. (Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 85). Also, a synonym of S4ukra.
<HI>KA1VYA (M). Agni Pura1n2a, Chapters 390 to 400
<>contain a discussion on poetry, which is the basis for
<>literary criticism in India. The above discussion in
<>Agni Pura1n2a, comprehends the forms and features of
<>poetry, rasa (sentiment), style, the art of acting and
<>the drama, and other matters related to poetry and
<>art.
<HI>KA1VYAMA1TA1. Mother of S4ukra, the preceptor of the
<>Daityas.
<F>1) S4ukra is also known as Ka1vya. Certain Pura1n2as claim S4ukra as the son of Bhr2gu, while certain others refer to him as the son of Kavi
<>son of Bhr2gu. Puloma1 was Bhr2gu's wife. But, the Pura1n2as call the mother of S4ukra Ka1vyama1ta1. No mention is made about the wife of Kavi
<>the son of Bhr2gu. Puloma1 and Ka1vyama1ta1 are different persons. Therefore, S4ukra might be the son of Bhr2gu hy another wife, or he might be
<>the son of Kavi.</F> Ka1vyama1ta1 possessed extraordinary powers
<>of penance. In the Devi1 Bha1gavata the following story
<>is given; how she cursed Vis2n2u and how she made
<>Vis2n2u and Indra powerless.
<NI>Once a fierce war was fought by the Devas and the
<>Asuras in which the latter got defeated, and they sought
<>the help of S4ukra1ca1rya. But, as the Devas enjoyed the
<>support of Vis2n2u, S4ukra could not do anything for the
<>asuras, and he therefore advised them to get on some-
<>how or other for some time. After that S4ukra went to
<>Kaila1sa and performed penance, hanging head down-
<>wards, for a thousand years to secure rare and ex-
<>ceptional mantras. During this period the Devas again
<>attacked the Asuras, who ran up to Ka1vyama1ta1 for
<>succour, and she, by one glance, sent the Devas to
<>long sleep. She reduced Vis2n2u and Indra also to a
<>state of paralysis. Then Vis2n2u meditated upon the
<>Sudars4ana Cakra, which arrived immediately and with
<>the Cakra he cut off Ka1vyama1ta1's head. Sage Bhr2gu
<>then appeared on the scene and brought back Ka1vya-
<>ma1ta1 to life, and she, in furious rage cursed that Vis2n2u
<>should take many births. As a result of the curse
<>Maha1vis2n2u had to incarnate himself on earth many
<>times. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<HI>KAVYAVA1HA (S). A group of Pitr2s. The Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandhas 11 and 15 state that this group of
<>Pit2rs were born from the drops of sweat which came
<>out of the bodies of Daks2a and others when they were
<>fascinated by the charm of Sandhya1, the spiritual
<>daughter of Brahma1.
<HI>KAYA1DHU1. Wife of Hiran2yakas4ipu. Prahla1da was
<>born to her.
<HI>KA1YAS4ODHANATI1RTHA. A holy place in Kuru-
<>ks2etra. According to Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, [Page403-a+ 65]
<>Chapter 86, by taking a bath at this place the body
<>would be purified.
<HI>KA1YAVYA. A Can2d2a1la. He was born to a Can2d2a1la
<>woman as the son of a Ks2atriya. But the Can2d2a1las
<>who were impressed by Ka1yavya's moral conduct,
<>made him the headman of the village. He taught
<>others that all people should honour Bra1hman2as and
<>love their country. His political creed was that those
<>who prospered by the ruin of a country were just like
<>the worms living on a dead body. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 135).
<HI>KEDA1RA. A holy place in the interior of Kuruks2etra.
<>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<>83, that those who bathe in this holy Bath would
<>obtain the fruits of good actions. One of the twelve
<>Lin3gas consecrated in important places, is in
<>Keda1ra.
<HI>KEKARALOHITA. A great serpent which once took
<>sage Cyavana to Pa1ta1la. Cyavana, after worshipping
<>S4iva at Nakules4vara ti1rtha got into river Narmada1 to
<>take his bath when the na1ga called Kekaralohita
<>caught hold of him, dragged him and bit him. As
<>the sage meditated upon Vis2n2u the poison did not
<>affect him. The serpent released him from Pa1ta1la as
<>he was unaffected by poison. Cyavana went to the
<>palace of Prahla1da accompanied by na1ga damsels. On
<>the request of Prahla1da Cyavana described to him the
<>holy places on earth, and without any delay Prahla1da
<>came to earth for hunting during which sojourn on
<>earth he visited Naimis2a1ran2ya. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 8).
<HI>KEKAYA. The Maha1bha1rata mentions another Kekaya,
<>a King of the solar dynasty. He wedded two Ma1lava
<>princesses from the elder of whom were born Ki1caka
<>and Upaki1caka, and from the younger was born
<>Sudes2n2a1, also called Kaikeyi1. This Sudes2n2a1 married
<>Ma1tsya, the Vira1t2a King. (Vira1t2a Parva, Southern
<>text, Chapter 16).
<HI>KEKAYA(M).
<NI>1) {%General.%} A Kingdom in ancient India. Kaikeyi1, one
<>of Das4aratha's wives, was a daughter of a Kekaya
<>King.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} The country got the name ‘Kekaya’ as it
<>was ruled by King Kekaya1. His genealogy is as follows.
<>Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Brahma1--Atri--Candra--
<>Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a--Yaya1ti--Anud-
<>ruhyu--Sabha1nara--Ka1lanara--Sr2n5jaya--Us4i1nara--
<>S4ibi--Kekaya. S4ibi had four sons called Bhadra,
<>Suvi1ra, Kekaya and Vr2s2a1darpa. (Bha1gavata 9th
<>Skandha).
<>{%Other details.%} (1) The King and the people of Kekaya
<>were called the Kekayas.
<NI>(2) Five heroic Kekaya princes met with their death
<>in fighting Dron2a. (Stri1 Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 25).
<NI>(3) Two Kekaya Princes, Vinda and Anuvinda fought
<>on the Kaurava side. (Karn2a Parva, Chapter 13).
<HI>KERAKA. People of an ancient country in South
<>India. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1parva,
<>Chapter 31 that Sahadeva the son of Ma1dri1 conquered
<>the Kerakas and Kerala.
<HI>KERALA.
<HI>1) {%General information.%} A small country lying in the
<>south-west corner of India. From the Pura1n2as it
<>could be understood that this country lying to the
<>south of Gokarn2a upto Cape Comorin and to the [Page403-b+ 65]
<>west of Western Ghats had a very ancient history and
<>civilization of its own.
<NI>2) {%Origin of Kerala.%} There are two statements, slightly
<>different from each other, in the Pura1n2as, about the
<>origin of Kerala.
<NI>(1) For performing the funeral ceremony of the sons
<>of Sagara whose ashes were lying in Pa1ta1la (Nether
<>world), Bhagi1ratha performed penance and brought
<>the heavenly river Gan3ga1 to the earth. (See under
<>Gan3ga1). The river fell in North India and flowed in
<>torrents to the sea and the surrounding regions were
<>submerged in water. Among the places submerged,
<>there was the important holy place and Bath of
<>Gokarn2a also, lying on the west coast of India. Those
<>hermits who lived in the vicinity of the temple at
<>Gokarn2a, escaped from the flood and went to Mahendra-
<>giri and informed Paras4ura1ma of the calamity of the
<>flood. Paras4ura1ma went with them to the sea-shore.
<>Varun2a did not make his appearance. The angry
<>Paras4ura1ma stood in deep meditation for a little
<>while. The weapons came to his hands. Varun2a was
<>filled with fear and he instantly appeared before
<>Paras4ura1ma, who asked him to release the land
<>swallowed by the sea. Varun2a agreed. Paras4ura1ma
<>sent his bow and arrow back to the sky. Then he took
<>a winnowing basket (S4u1rpa) and threw it at the sea.
<>The sea retreated from the place up to the spot where
<>the winnowing basket fell, and the portion of land
<>including Gokarn2a which had been swallowed by sea was
<>recovered. This land is called Kerala, which is known
<>by the name ‘S4u1rpa1raka’ also. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 98 and 99).
<NI>(2) Paras4ura1ma went round the world eighteen
<>times and killed all the Ks2atriya Kings. After that he
<>performed the sacrifice of As4vamedha (horse sacrifice).
<>In the sacrifice he gave all the lands as alms to
<>Brahmins. Kas4yapa received all the lands for the
<>Brahmins. After that he requested Paras4ura1ma to
<>vacate the land. Accordingly Paras4ura1ma created
<>new land by shooting an arrow at the sea, for
<>his own use. “At the words of Kas4yapa, he made the
<>sea retreat by shooting an arrow, thereby creating dry
<>land.” This land was Kerala. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 70).
<NI>3) {%Kerala and Pa1ta1la (Nether world).%} The ancient
<>sages of the Pura1n2as have grouped the worlds into
<>three, the Svarga (heaven), Bhu1mi (the earth) and
<>the Pa1ta1la (the nether world). The three worlds taken
<>as a whole were divided into fourteen worlds. It does
<>not appear that this grouping was merely imaginary.
<>A keen observation of the Pura1n2as would lead one to
<>infer that the Hima1layan plateau was considered as
<>Devaloka-Svarga (heaven), the planes between the
<>Hima1laya and the Vindhya as Bhu1loka (the earth)
<>and the regions to the south of the Vindhya as Pa1ta1la
<>(the nether world), by the ancient people of India.
<>The seven worlds of Pa1ta1la such as Atala, Vitala,
<>Sutala, Tala1tala, Maha1tala, Rasa1tala and Pa1ta1la might
<>have been seven countries in this region. The following
<>description which occurs in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8,
<>would substantiate this inference.
<NI>“Pa1ta1la is below the earth. This Pa1ta1la is a group of
<>seven worlds one below the other, with names, Atala,
<>Vitala, Sutala, Tala1tala, Rasa1tala and Maha1tala. In
<>all those worlds, there are several beautiful cities and [Page404-a+ 65]
<>houses, palaces and castles, parks, gardens, open temples
<>and halls, natural arbours etc. made by Maya. There
<>live the Asuras, the Da1navas (a class of Asuras-demons)
<>the na1gas (serpents) and others, with their families,
<>with happiness and comfort. Chirping birds, pigeons,
<>parrots, docile parrots etc. always play there with their
<>inseparable mates. Trees bearing sweet fruits, plants
<>covered with fragrant flowers, arbours with creepers
<>growing thick, beautiful houses floored with white
<>marble, and so many other things giving pleasure and
<>comfort are seen there in plenty. In these things the
<>Pa1ta1la surpasses heaven. Daityas, Da1navas and the
<>Na1gas (the Asuras and the serpents) are the dwellers
<>of these worlds. They lead a happy and pleasant life with
<>their families enjoying all sorts of comfort and luxury.”
<>Pa1ta1la, one of the seven divisions of the world is describ-
<>ed as follows:
<NI>“This is the region of the Na1gas (the serpents). At the
<>root-place of this region there is a particular place
<>having an area of thirty thousand yojanas. Vis2n2u Kala1
<>who has the attribute of ‘ta1masa’ (darkness) lives there
<>under the name ‘Ananta’. The real Ananta or A1dis4es2a
<>is the radiant embodiment of this Kala1. The daughters
<>of the Na1ga Kings are of fair complexion and very
<>beautiful, with clean body. They use perfumeries such
<>as sandalwood, aloewood, saffron, etc.”
<NI>In this description, the words Daityas, Na1gas, Ananta,
<>Sandalwood, aloewood etc. and the mention of natural
<>beauty should be paid particular attention to. From
<>the Ra1ma1yan2a we can understand that the A1ryas refer-
<>red to the Dra1vid2as as Asuras, Ra1ks2asas (Giants) etc.
<>History says that the Na1gas were the early inhabitants
<>of Kerala. The ancient word ‘Ananta’ denotes Tri-
<>vandrum (Tiru-Ananta-puram). The temple of S4ri1
<>Padmana1bha at Trivandrum answers to this descrip-
<>tion. The perfumeries such as sandalwood, aloewood
<>(cidar) etc. are the wealth of Kerala. On the whole the
<>description of Pa1ta1la fits well with that of Kerala. So
<>it is not wrong to {??}fer that the description of Pa1ta1la
<>in the Pura1n2as is entirely about Kerala in all its
<>aspects.
<NI>4) {%The Primitiveness of Kerala.%} From the portions of
<>Pura1n2as given below it could be ascertained that
<>Kerala had an independence of its own from the very
<>ancient days.
<NI>(1) Among the Kings who attended the Svayam3vara
<>(marriage) of S4as4ikala1, the daughter of the King of
<>Ka1s4i1, such as, the King of Kuru, King of Ma1dra, King
<>of Sindhu, King of Pa1n5ca1la, Kings of Karn2a1t2aka, Cola
<>and Vidarbha, there was the King of Kerala also. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 3).
<NI>(2) When describing the various places in the Southern
<>part of Bha1rata, names such as Dramid2a, Kerala,
<>Mu1s2ika, Karn2a1t2aka etc. occur in the Maha1bha1rata.
<>So it is to be understood that when Vya1sa wrote
<>Bha1rata, there was the kingdom of Kerala and that it
<>was separate from the country of Dra1vid2a. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9).
<NI>(3) “Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna took his majestic seat in the
<>midst of Cola, Kerala, Pa1n2d2ya and other Kings of the
<>countries under the sea, who were standing round him
<>to pay homage to him.” (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>54).
<NI>(4) It is mentioned in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 277, that
<>a King named Ga1ndha1ra was born in the dynasty [Page404-b+ 65]
<>of Turvasu the brother of Yadu, and that from Ga1n-
<>dha1ra were born the powerful families of the Ga1ndha1ras
<>the Keralas, the Colas, the Pa1n2d2yas and the Kolas.
<NI>(5) In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 175, it is
<>mentioned that the people of Kerala were considered as
<>barbarians by the North Indians.
<NI>(6) In Bha1gavata, Skandha 10, it is mentioned that the
<>Kings of Cola, Pa1n2d2ya and Kerala, from South India,
<>had reached the capital city of Vidarbha to take part
<>in the Svayam3vara (marriage) of Rukmin2i1.
<NI>(7) Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 254, Stanza 15, that in his conquest of the
<>countries, Karn2a had conquered Kerala also.
<NI>(8) It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 31, that Sahadeva, one of the Pa1n2d2avas, con-
<>quered the Keralas and the Kerakas. It may be noted
<>that the Kerakas are different from Keralas.
<NI>(9) Va1lmi1ki mentions the countries which could be
<>seen by the monkeys who were sent to the South by
<>Sugri1va to search for Si1ta1.
<Poem>Nadi1m3 Goda1vari1m3 caiva
<>Sarvameva1nupas4yata /
<>Tathaiva1ndhra1n ca Paun2d2ra1n ca
<>Cola1n Pa1n2d2ya1n ca Kerala1n. //</Poem>
<NI>“You could see the river Goda1vari1 and beyond it the
<>countries of A1ndhra, Paun2d2ra, Cola, Pa1n2d2ya and
<>Kerala.”
<NI>This is a proof of the primitiveness of Kerala.
<>(10) The King of Kerala had given Yudhis2t2hira, as
<>presents, sandalwood, pearls. Lapis Lazuli etc. (M.B.
<>Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 51).
<>In several other Pura1n2as also, mention about Kerala
<>occurs.
<NI>5) {%The ancient administration of Kerala.%} Parimelazhakar,
<>a San3ga poet who was a great expounder of “Tirukku-
<>ral”, has stated that from the beginning of the world
<>the three kingdoms, Cera, Cola and Pa1n2d2ya had existed.
<>Though there is a bit of exaggeration in this statement,
<>there are enough proofs to say that a long time before
<>the birth of Christ, Kerala was under a systematic rule.
<>In ‘Tolka1ppiyam’ the first grammatical work in Tamil
<>mention is made about the administration of Kerala.
<>Megasthenes, a traveller of 4th century B.C. has stated
<>about the rule of Kerala:
<NI>There were five councils called the Pan5camaha1sabha1s
<>(the five great councils) to help the Cera Kings.
<>It is stated that these councils were formed by the King
<>Utiyan Cera of the Tr2kkan2a1 fort. Besides these five
<>councils there was an advisory Committee, of which, the
<>priest of the King, the Chief Minister, Chief of the spies
<>and the Chief Revenue officer (Ka1vit2i) were members.
<>For convenience of administration the country was
<>divided into tarakku1t2t2as (groups of houses--villages) and
<>and Na1t2t2ukku1t2t2as (Districts--group of villages). Taras
<>(villages) were ruled by four elders (Ka1ran2avas). Four
<>villages formed a Na1lpa1d2u (group) of four. Four Na1l-
<>pa1dus formed a Kazhaka (a division of the country with
<>a chief temple within it) and four Kazhakas formed a
<>Perum3kazhaka (greater Kazhaka). Perum3kazhaka was
<>also known as Tr2kkala. The assembly hall of tr2k-
<>ku1t2t2a is called Kot2t2il. This hall was erected generally
<>beside the temple. The chief officer of the temple
<>was the chairman of the tr2kku1t2t2a (assembly of
<>the people). When a tr2kku1t2t2a is assembled, sixtyfour
<>elders of the “taras”, the “accas” (officers) of Kazhakas, [Page405-a+ 65]
<>the sixtyfour Tan2d2a1ns and sixteen Na1lpa1dies had to be
<>present. The Na1lpa1dies were the chiefs of four taras.
<>The accas, who were the Presidents, had to come clad
<>in variegated silk, with waist-band of long cloth and
<>wearing a small sword (Churika1). Till recently the
<>Kazhakas of An2d2allu1r, Ra1mpallya, Kurvantat2t2a, Turutti
<>etc., and so many Na1lpa1dus and taras and the elders
<>thereof had been retaining and enjoying titles and
<>distinctions of rank.
<NI>The Namboothiris (Brahmins) entered Kerala before
<>the beginning of the Malaya1la Era. With that, changes
<>took place in the administration of Kerala. Certain
<>edicts help us to ascertain the changes that took place
<>in the administration. The edict of Va1zhappally of the
<>9th century by Ra1jas4ekhara is an important one in
<>this connection. This emperor of the Ceras who is consi-
<>dered to be a contemporary of S4ri1 S4an3kara1ca1rya had
<>the title beginning with “Ra1ja1dhira1ja Parames4vara
<>Bhat2t2a1raka”. (T.A.S. Vol. II, P. 8-14). The subject
<>dealt with in the edict is the ‘daily worship and settle-
<>ment’, in the temple of Tiruvot2t2iyu1r. It is stated in this
<>edict that the people of Va1zhappally and the representa-
<>tives of 18 Na1dus or divisions had met in the temple
<>and taken certain decisions.
<NI>The next one is the Kottayam Copper edicts known as
<>the ‘Tarisa Church Edicts.’ This is a document granting
<>the Tarisa Church in Quilon, the adjoining lands and
<>some other institutions. This edict was granted by
<>Ayyanat2i tiruvat2ikal the ruler of the Na1t2u (division),
<>for the Cera emperor. It is mentioned as “including
<>the Temple Officer Vijayara1katevar”, which means
<>that Vijayara1ka had been present on the occasion of
<>granting the edict, as the representative of Emperor
<>Stha1n2uravi. The Na1d2uva1zhis (local chiefs or rulers of
<>division) were not empowered to take decision in very
<>important matters. Titles, rights distinctions of rank
<>etc. were granted by a council of Chief minister,
<>Officers, Punnattalappati and Polakku1t2ippati (two
<>high officials). Vijayara1katevar, the Koil adhika1ri,
<>was the representative of the emperor at Mahodaya-
<>pura. The supervising officials of temples were gene-
<>rally called the ‘Koil adhika1ri’. Normally-the younger
<>brothers of the Kings were appointed in this rank.
<>These temple-officers were helped in their duties by
<>the Division-rulers, people of the locality and the in-
<>ferior officers in the temple. When the empire of
<>Kulas4ekhara declined, the family of Perumpad2appu
<>got this position of ‘Koil adhika1ri’. So the title ‘Koil
<>adhika1ri’ is added to the names of the princes of
<>Cochin.
<NI>Another one is the Mampally Edicts. This is a deed of
<>granting some lands free to the temple of Airu1r, in the
<>name of A1diccan Umayamma of Tr2kkalayapuram, by
<>Ven2a1t2t2u S4ri1 Vallabhankota in M.E. 149. Even such
<>an unimportant thing as the granting of free lands,
<>had to be effected with the permission of Cera kings
<>and their councils. (T.A.S. Vol IV, Page 9).
<NI>From these edicts it is clear that the administration of
<>the temples was carried out by representatives elected
<>by people. For each village temple there was an
<>administrative council. These councils were controlled
<>by Na1duva1zhis and Des4ava1zhis (Divisional and Sub
<>Divisional rulers who had Nair infantry (big or small
<>as the case may be) at their disposal. The adminis-
<>trative assembly met either in the open hall at the main [Page405-b+ 65]
<>gate of the temple or on the stage for performances.
<>The rights and authorities were in the hands of the
<>general assembly of the people called Na1t2t2ukku1t2t2a and
<>the council of the temple officials. When the Namboothi-
<>ris became powerful they became members of the
<>council. With this change the Kings and Koil adhika1ris
<>became puppets in the hands of the Namboothiris. In
<>the Ra1mes4varam edict of M.E. 278 it is mentioned that
<>King Ra1mavarma Kulas4ekhara was punished with
<>retribution for his ‘hatred’ of the A1ryas. Finally the
<>Nambu1thiris (Malaya1la Brahmins) became the land-
<>lords of the country.
<NI>6) {%The people af ancient Kerala.%} It is assumed that the
<>ancient inhabitants of Kerala were Dra1vid2as. But
<>some historians have mentioned about the ‘Proto
<>Dravidians and the Pre Dravidians. The hill tribes such
<>as Ka1n2ikka1rs, Mutuvas, Mala Vet2as, Pulayas, Kura-
<>vas, Na1ya1t2is, Malayarayas, Malayat2is, Malap-
<>pan2d2a1ras, Malayu1ra1lis, Mutuvans Pulla1t2is etc. are
<>said to have belonged to this group. They worshipped
<>several things such as stone, banyan tree, elenji tree,
<>Asclapia tree, Ni1m tree Terminatia Bellarica, Borassus
<>flabelliformis, cassia fistula, Ghosts, thunder, rain, the
<>sun etc. They worshipped good ghosts for welfare, and
<>bad ghosts to avoid misfortunes. They had images of
<>Ma1t2a, Ca1tta, Ca1vu, Maruta, Pettuca1vu, Arukula,
<>Preta, Vazhipin2akki, A1yiramilli, Parakkut2t2i, Ka1ttuja1ti,
<>Malava1zhi, Ma1rin2i, Na1ya1t2t2u Pe Man3ka1t2t2amma,
<>Muniyappa, Vet2t2akka1ran and so on. They worshipped
<>in small bushes, open grounds or houses. They knew
<>black magic such as cursing, giving poison in meals etc.
<>These uncivilized people were very particular about
<>cleanliness on the occasions of delivery, menstrua1tion,
<>death etc. They pleased bad ghosts by offering liquor,
<>flesh and blood, and good ghosts with milk, ghee, honey
<>etc. They buried dead bodies with a little raw rice
<>meant for food at the time of entering the other world.
<>They had collective worship. They sang songs at the
<>time of worship using some primitive musical instru-
<>ments. For each village there were elders who were
<>priests and rulers. They erected stone huts in the burial
<>place and buried the dead inside these in graves. These
<>graves were called ‘Pa1n2d2ukuzhy’. The U1ra1lis, continue
<>the custom of posting two stones at either end of the
<>grave. The custom of burial prevailed more than
<>cremation.
<NI>Nair, Nambu1tiri, I1zhava, Christians, Muslims and such
<>other castes came to Kerala from other places later.
<NI>7){%Ibn Batuta and Kerala.%} Ibn Batuta who was born in the
<>town of T2a1nji1r in Morocco in Africa in A.D. 1304 had
<>travelled all over the Eastern countries then known. He
<>had started from his house on a Haj Pilgrimage at the
<>age of 22. He returned home only after 29 years, having
<>travelled all over the known countries. He has written
<>a book in Arabic about his travels of 29 years. One third
<>of this thick volume is devoted for descriptions of his
<>travels in India alone. Its name is ‘Tuh Phattunanna1r’.
<>He passed over the Hindu Kush in A.D. 1333 and
<>entered India. In the midst of his travels throughout
<>the length and breadth of India, he came to Kerala
<>also. He says as follows about Kerala in his book:--
<>“Malabar is the country of Pepper. This country's
<>length from Gokarn2a to Quilon is two months’ journey.
<>All the roads in this country are rendered cool and shady
<>by asclapia trees. On the roads at intervals of half an [Page406-a+ 64]
<>hour there are inns. Near the inn there will be a well
<>and a person to give water. The non-Muslims are given
<>water in pots. But water is poured into the hands of
<>Muslims. Rice is served in plantain leaf and sauces
<>are also served in the same leaf. Uncultivated and
<>uninhabited land is not to be seen. Each house is
<>situated in the centre of a cultivated area. The people
<>of this country do not use animals to carry goods.
<>Travelling is on foot Only Kings use horses. There is
<>a conveyance called man5cal (Palanquin). Slaves are
<>used as Palanquin bearers. I have seen roads which
<>could be used so fearlessly, only in Kerala and, no
<>where else in the world. Capital punishment is given to
<>one who steals even a coconut. The people of this
<>country respect Muslims.
<NI>There are twelve kings in Malabar. None of them
<>are Muslims. Many of them are powerful having an
<>army of more than fifty-thousand soldiers. But there are
<>no quarrels or clashes among them. The powerful do
<>not have the desire to subjugate the less powerful. The
<>inheritants of these kings are not sons, but nephews
<>(sons of sisters). Besides the people of Kerala I have
<>seen only the Muslims of the country of Salam on the
<>banks of the Niger in Africa who have adopted the
<>system of inheritance in the female line.”
<NI>Ibn Batuta has given some minor descriptions about
<>the towns of Man3gala1puram, Ezhumala, Kan2n2u1r
<>Calicut, Pa1liyam, Cra1n3ganu1r and Quilon.
<HI>KESARA. A Mountain in S4a1kadvi1pa (S4a1ka island).
<>The air on this mountain was always filled with frag-
<>rance. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 11, Stanza 23).
<HI>KESARI1. A forest King who lived in the Maha1 Meru.
<>While Kesari1 was living in the Maha1meru, Brahma1
<>cursed a celestial maid named Ma1nagarva1 and changed
<>her into a female monkey. She became the wife of
<>Kesari1, under the name An5jana1. For a long time the
<>couple had no children. An5jan5a worshipped Va1yu Bha-
<>gava1n (Wind-God) for a child.
<NI>Once during this period the gods and hermits went
<>to Parama S4iva and requested him to beget a son to
<>help Maha1vis2n2u who was about to incarnate as S4ri1
<>Ra1ma to kill Ra1van2a. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 instantly took
<>the form of monkeys and entered the forest for play.
<>They having not returned for a long time the gods
<>asked the wind-god to go in search of them. The wind
<>god came in the form of a great storm and shook the
<>whole of the forest. Still they did not come out. Pa1rvati1
<>who was pregnant was ashamed to come out. With
<>S4iva she got on an As4oka tree and sat there. Seeing
<>that tree alone standing motionless in the big storm
<>Va1yu god approached the tree and looked up. S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1 appeared before Va1yu. Pa1rvati1 refused to take
<>the foetus in the form of monkey to Kaila1sa. As S4iva
<>had instructed, Pa1rvati1 gave the child in the womb to
<>the wind-god. It was at this time that An5jana1 had
<>prayed to Va1yu for a child. Va1yu gave that child
<>to An5jana1, who gave birth to it. That child was

<HI>KES4I1 I.
<NI>1). {%General information.%} An Asura. It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65 that forty Asuras
<>or Da1navas were born to Kas4yapa, the son of Mari1ci,
<>and the grandson of Brahma1, by his wife Danu, and
<>that Kes4i1 was one of them.
<NI>2). {%Kes4i1 and Indra.%} Once a war broke out between
<>the Devas and the Asuras. Disasters befell the Devas.
<>Daityasena1 and Devasena1, the daughters of Praja1pati
<>were about to be carried away by Kes4i1. Daityasena1
<>agreed to accompany him of her own accord, but
<>Devasena1 cried aloud. Hearing her cry Devendra rea-
<>ched the spot. A terrible fight ensued and finally the
<>defeated Kes4i1 ran away. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>223).
<NI>3). {%Kes4i1 and Vis2n2u.%} Once there was a fight which last-

<HI>KES4I1 II. A follower of Kam3sa. This Asura, on the in-
<>struction of Kam3sa, went to Amba1d2i (Gokula) taking
<>the form of a horse. to kill S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed
<>Kes4i1. It is seen in the Bha1gavata (Malaya1lam) that S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a got the name Kes4ava because he had killed Kes4i1.
<>(Skandha 10, Kes4ivadha).
<HI>KES4I1 III. In Bha1gavata there is another Kes4i1 who was
<>the son of Vasudeva.

<NI>Pauravi1, Rohin2i1, Bhadra1, Madira1, Rocana1, Ila1 and
<>Devaki1 were the wives of Vasudeva.
<NI>From this statement made in Bha1gavata, Skandha 9,

<>wives. Kausalya1, who was one of them, was the mother
<>of Kes4i1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, Chapter 24, Stanza
<>48).
<HI>KES4INI1 I. A celestial woman. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva
<>Chapter 65 it is stated that the twelve celestial maids,

<>that once Pa1rvati1 with her servant Kes4ini1 praised
<>S4iva.
<HI>KES4INI1 V. Once there arose a quarrel between Sudh-
<>anva1, the son of An3giras, and Virocana the son of Prah-
<>la1da, because both wanted to marry the same girl
<>named Kes4ini1. Sudhanva1 was a Brahmin whereas
<>Virocana was an Asura, who argued that Asura was
<>nobler than Brahmin and Sudhanva1 said that it was the
<>other way. Both wagered their lives and accepted
<>Prahla1da as their judge. The decision of Prahla1da was [Page407-a+ 64]
<>that the Brahmin was the nobler of the two. Because
<>Prahla1da said the truth Sudhanva1 did not kill Viro-
<>cana. But Virocana had to wash the lfeet of Sudhanva1
<>in the presence of Kes4ini1, feet Sudhanva1 married
<>Kes4ini1 in the presence of Virocana. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 35).

<HI>KETAKI1. (A flower). [Pandarnus odoratissimus]
<>Though Ketaki1 is a flower which had been worn on
<>S4iva's head, it is not worshipped for the following
<>reason.
<NI>In Satyayuga Maha1vis2n2u performed intense penance
<>on the S4veta island for the attainment of eternal happi-
<>ness. Brahma1 also performed penance at a beauti-
<>ful place for the annihilation of desires. During
<>their tapas Vis2n2u and Brahma1, for a rest, left their
<>seats and walked about in the forest when they met
<>each other. There arose a controversy between them
<>about their respective greatness when S4iva, in the form
<>of a Lin3ga, appeared between the two contestants and
<>told them that he, who first found out his (S4iva's) head
<>or feet was greater than the other. Accordingly Vis2n2u
<>went down and Brahma1 went up on a tour of
<>enquiry.
<NI>Though Vis2n2u went down deeper and deeper for a long
<>time to find out S4iva's feet he failed in the attempt and so
<>returned and sat at the place whence he started for the
<>search. Brahma1 went up a very long distance when he
<>saw a Ketaki1 flower falling down from the sky. He took
<>the flower in his hands and went to Vis2n2u and told him
<>that he had found out S4iva's head and showed the
<>Ketaki1 flower as proof of his discovery claiming that it
<>was taken from S4iva's head. But Vis2n2u did not believe
<>Brahma1 and asked the Ketaki1 flower to bear witness
<>to Brahma1's claim. The flower gave false evidence in
<>favour of Brahma1. S4iva got angry at this false evidence
<>of Ketaki1 and cursed it. The Ketaki1 lost its place
<>among the best flowers from that day onwards.
<HI>KETU I. (KETUMA1N). A Da1nava. He was the son

<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>But Ketu maintained closer relationship with Ra1hu, a
<>step-brother of his, being the son of Kas4yapa by ano-
<>ther wife called Sim3hika1. Ra1hu and Ketu are even
<>today considered as inauspicious planets. Ra1hu wears
<>a half-moon and Ketu holds in his hands a sword and
<>lamp. Amitaujas was Ketu reborn. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>67, Verse 11).

<>Dhu1maketu.
<NI>Noting that the population on earth had increased
<>abnormally Brahma1 created a damsel called Mr2tyu and
<>asked her to kill people. At this command of Brahma1
<>she began crying, and from her tear drops various kinds
<>of diseases originated at the sight of which she took to
<>penance. Then Brahma1 appeared and blessed her say-
<>ing that no one would die because of her at which she
<>heaved a great sigh of relief from which was born Ketu
<>or Dhu1maketu.
<HI>KETUMA1LA I. The grandson of Priyavrata, the son of

<>then flew against the breast of Na1ra1yan2a who was
<>sitting in penance in Badarya1s4rama. By the power of
<>the trident the hair of Na1ra1yan2a became of mun5ja (a
<>grass) colour. From that day onwards Na1ra1yan2a came
<>to be known by the name Mun5jakes4a. By a sound
<>“hum”, the hermit Na1ra1yan2a deviated the trident,
<>which reached the hands of S4iva, who got angry and
<>approached Na1ra1yan2a to kill him. Nara, who was close
<>by took an arrow and reciting spells over it, released it
<>to kill S4iva. Immediately the arrow changed to an axe.
<>S4iva broke the axe. After this the axe became the
<>weapon of S4iva. In Maha1bha1rata S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>49, Stanza 33, it is mentioned that this axe was given
<>to Paras4ura1ma the disciple of S4iva. Thenceforward
<>S4iva got the name Khan2d2aparas4u. (Paras4u means
<>axe). (Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 343. Stan-
<>zas 150-59, 167).
<HI>KHA1N2D2AVADA1HA.
<>1){%Introduction.%} Long ago a King named S4vetaki1 began
<>to perform a sacrifice of duration of 100 years. Many
<>Brahmins took part in the sacrifice as priests conducting
<>the rituals and ceremonies. These Brahmin priests be-
<>gan to depart after a few years turning blind due to the
<>smoke coming out of the sacrificial fire. Thus the sacrifice
<>was stopped for want of priests. S4vetaki1 was grieved at
<>this and performed penance to S4iva for getting a
<>priest. S4iva appeared before him and pointed out
<>hermit Durva1sas as the priest. S4vetaki1 recommenced the
<>sacrifice and under the supervision of Durva1sas the
<>sacrifice was completed. But Fire god caught dysen-
<>tery due to the continuous eating of oblations offered in
<>the sacrificial fire for a long period. His face became
<>pale, body became lean, and he had no taste for food.
<>At last Fire-God went to Brahma1 and complained
<>about his disease. Brahma1 said that in the forest of
<>Kha1n2d2ava there lived so many creatures which were
<>enemies of the devas (gods) and that by eating their
<>fat the disease of Agni would be cured. Accordingly
<>Agni came to the Kha1n2d2ava forest. [Page409-a+ 65]
<NI>The serpent Taks2aka, a friend of Indra, lived in this
<>forest with his wife and children. Indra knew that Agni
<>had come to burn the Kha1n2d2ava forest and resolved to
<>save Taks2aka at any cost. When Agni (fire) began to
<>catch the forest, Indra had already begun rain. So it
<>was not possible for Agni to consume the forest. Agni
<>tried seven times to consume the forest and in all these
<>seven attempts he failed. Agni again approached
<>Brahma1, who told him that the Nara-Na1ra1yan2as would
<>take birth in the earth as Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna and that
<>at that time it would be possible for fire to consume the
<>forest Kha1n2d2ava.
<NI>2) {%Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna in the forest of Kha1n2d2ava.%} While the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were living in Indraprastha, once the hot
<>season became so unbearable that Arjuna took Kr2s2n2a with
<>him and went to the forest of Kha1n2d2ava. While they
<>were playing in the river Yamuna1 with their wives
<>Agni came there in the guise of an old Brahmin and told
<>them all that had happened and requested their help
<>for eating the Kha1n2d2ava forest. Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna
<>promised to help him in this affair.
<NI>3) {%Preparation of weapons.%} For the time being Kr2s2n2a
<>and Arjuna were not having sufficient weapons. Agni
<>(fire-god) thought of Varun2a (the God of water) who
<>instantly appeared. At the request of Agni Varun2a gave
<>Arjuna the famous bow ‘Candradhanus’ (Ga1n2d2i1va), a
<>quiver which would never become empty of arrows
<>and a chariot having a flag with the sign of monkey.
<>and to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the weapon of the discus. Varun2a gave
<>four white horses also with gold chains round their necks
<>for drawing the chariot of Arjuna. With these weapons
<>Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna got ready to help Agni. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>became the charioteer of Arjuna.
<NI>4) {%Burning the forest.%} When Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna stood
<>ready Agni began to consume the forest. Kr2s2n2a and
<>Arjuna guarded the boundaries of the forest so that
<>the inmates of the forest might not escape. The living
<>creatures ran hither and thither finding no way to
<>escape. Many died of suffocation. At that time the
<>hermits who were dwellers of that forest ran to Indra
<>and informed him of the great calamity. Indra instantly
<>got ready to fight and save the forest. He covered the
<>whole of the sky with clouds and a heavy rain was
<>showered on the forest. Arjuna created a covering of
<>arrows like an umbrella over the fire and saved him
<>from the rain.
<NI>5) {%The family of Taks2aka.%} At this particular time
<>Taks2aka had been away at Kuruks2etra. As4vasena the
<>son of Taks2aka was writhing with heat and pain.
<>Seeing this his mother (wife of Taks2aka) swallowed him
<>from tail to head. Then she ran to the boundary to
<>throw the child into the outer region. Seeing this
<>Arjuna got angry and cut at the head of As4vasena. But
<>at the nick of time Indra sent a storm and made Arjuna
<>swoon and As4vasena was saved. So Arjuna became
<>furious and began to cut down every creature he saw.
<>Arjuna, Kr2s2n2a and Agni together cursed As4vasena that
<>he would get refuge nowhere.
<NI>As4vasena kept up his hatred of Arjuna. In the Bha1rata
<>battle, As4vasena got on an arrow sent by Karn2a at
<>Arjuna and knocked off the crown of Arjuna and return-
<>ed. But due to the curse Karn2a did not receive him
<>back.
<NI>6) {%Deadly fight.%} The serpents and hawks confronted
<>Arjuna, who cut off their heads. Kr2s2n2a killed the [Page409-b+ 65]
<>Asuras with the weapon discus. Indra came to the
<>battle-field riding on his elephant Aira1vata. Ka1la
<>(Time), Kubera, Skanda, As4vini1devas and all the other
<>Devas (gods), and Asuras (demons) helped Indra in the
<>fight. But Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna came out victorious.
<NI>7) {%The advent of Maya.%} Meanwhile Kr2s2n2a and
<>Arjuna called Indra and told him who they were and
<>informed him that Taks2aka had gone to Kuruks2etra.
<>Hearing this Indra blessed Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna and
<>retreated from the battlefield. Agni began to consume
<>the forest more vigorously than before. Because of the
<>unbearable heat, Maya, the architect of the Asuras,
<>came out of the house of Taks2aka and ran to Kr2s2n2a
<>and Arjuna and entreated them to save him. Accordingly
<>Arjuna saved him from the fire.
<NI>8) {%The story of four birds which escaped from the fire.%} In
<>that forest a hermit named Mandapa1la had erected his
<>hermitage and lived there performing penance. He died
<>and went to the world of ancestors. But there, the hermit
<>did not attain any fruit of the penance he had performed.
<>The hermit asked the Devas for the reason. They replied
<>that it was because the hermit had no sons. The hermit
<>came to the forest again to marry and beget sons.
<>Mandapa1la married a bird called Jarita1. Four sons named
<>Jarita1ri, Sa1risr2kka, Stambamitra and Dron2a, were born
<>to them. After this Mandapa1la left Jarita1 and her sons
<>and went after another woman Lapita1.
<NI>Feathers were not yet grown on the body of Jarita1's
<>four sons. The burning of the forest began before it.
<>Jarita1 and her sons were in a sorry plight. The mother
<>could fly. But she did not think of leaving her young
<>ones in danger. She decided to die in the fire folding
<>the young ones under her wings. But her sons did not agree
<>to it. They entreated her to fly away. Thus moments of
<>tears passed by. At last Jarita1 told them crying, “There
<>is the hole of a rat closeby. The rat had been taken
<>away by a kite. I will take you to that hole and close
<>it. Then I shall go away and return when the fire is
<>abated.”
<NI>But the young ones did not agree to this. They loved
<>to be killed by fire, rather than to be killed by rat. Final-
<>ly at their request Jarita1 flew away.
<NI>Mandapa1la thought of his sons. He separated from
<>Lapita1, and came to Agni and requested him to save
<>his sons and Jarita1. Agni consumed the forest and
<>neared the birds. The young birds requested Agni to
<>save them. Agni Deva saved them. Mandapa1la and
<>Jarita1 returned. That family lived for a long time in
<>joy and happiness and finally attained the world of the
<>gods. Agni returned to heaven after the burning of
<>the forest of Kha1n2d2ava. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 233
<>to 346).
<HI>KHA1N2D2AVAPRASTHA. See under Indraprastha.
<HI>KHA1N2D2AVA1YANA. Paras4ura1ma gave all the coun-
<>tries conquered by him to Kas4yapa. Along with the lands
<>he gave a golden dais also. The group of hermits called
<>Kha1n2d2ava1yanas cut the dais into pieces and shared them
<>with the permission of Kas4yapa. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 117, Stanza 13).
<HI>KHA1N2D2IKYA. A Ks2atriya King. Kes4idhvaja was the
<>son of his paternal uncle. Both had learned well the
<>ways of union with the divine life. Kha1n2d2ikya had be-
<>come an expert in Karmayoga (the path of action) for
<>becoming one with the divine life whereas Kes4idhvaja
<>tried to achieve oneness with divine life by Jn5a1na [Page410-a+ 65]
<>Yoga (the path of knowledge or spiritual attainment).
<>Each desired to subdue the other. Consequently
<>Kha1n2d2ikya lost his kingdom and had to live in a forest
<>with his priest and minister. (Bha1gavata, Skandhas 9
<>and 13).
<NI>Kes4idhvaja who tried the path of knowledge to attain
<>Absolution performed several sacrifices for that purpose
<>and cut himself asunder from the bonds of action. Once,
<>while he was performing a sacrifice, a tiger came to the
<>place of sacrifice and killed the sacrificial cow. Then
<>Kes4idhvaja asked the priests who were conducting the
<>sacrifice, what the atonement was for the death of the
<>sacrificial cow. The priests sent the King to the hermit
<>Kas4eru, who sent the King to the hermit Bhr2gu. Hermit
<>Bhr2gu in his turn sent the King to the hermit S4unaka.
<>But the matter did not end there. The hermit S4unaka
<>could not dictate the atonement for the death of the
<>sacrificial cow. So he sent the King to Kha1n2d2ikya who
<>was living in the forest. The moment Kha1n2d2ikya saw
<>Kes4idhvaja he stood ready to kill him. But Kes4idhvaja
<>revealed everything to Kha1n2d2ikya, When he under-
<>stood the situation Kha1n2d2ikya told him with sincerity
<>the rites given in the S4a1stras (Veda1n3gas) to atone the
<>death of the sacrificial cow.
<NI>Kes4idhvaja returned and completed the sacrifice. The
<>one item of ‘gift to the teacher’ alone remained. So Kes4i1-
<>dhvaja came to the forest again. Kha1n2d2ikya raised the
<>sword to cut him. Kes4idhvaja said that he had come to
<>give Gurudaks2in2a1 to the teacher. Kha1n2d2ikya repented
<>his rashness and requested Kes4idhvaja to tell him the
<>ways of cutting himself asunder from the bonds of
<>sorrow and grief. Kes4idhvaja advised him the ways to
<>obtain eternal bliss. (Na1rada Pura1n2a).
<HI>KHANI1NETRA. The eldest son of Vivam3s4a, a King

<>who had no one to help him once looked with anger at
<>Kubera, who, understanding the wish of his father gave
<>him three giantesses named Pus2potkat2a1, Ra1ka1 and
<>Ma1lini1 as attendants. They attended on him faithfully
<>and Vis4ravas was pleased with them. To Vis4ravas two

<>as her husband. Laks2man2a cut off her nose and ears. [Page410-b+ 65]
<>She went to Khara, Du1s2an2a and Tris4iras and lamented
<>before them. The three of them immediately started
<>with an army of fourteen thousand giants and fought
<>with Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, who killed every one of
<>them. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Sargas 19

<>onwards he left all the work of administration in the
<>hands of ministers and spent the remaining days in
<>devotion and meditation. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 2).
<NI>2) {%Particular details.%} In Maha1bha1rata it is mentioned

<>younger to him called Upa-Ki1cakas. Their only sister
<>was called Sudes2n2a1, (Bha1rata, Southern text, Page

<>an aspect of Ba1n2a, the eldest of the Asuras known as
<>the Ka1lakeyas. (See Bha1rata, Page 1893). Ma1tsya, the

<>wards, the brothers too lived in the Vira1t2a palace. Ki1caka
<>was the chieftain of Vira1t2a's army, and he had, many a

<NI>2) {%Ki1caka and Pa1n5ca1li1.%} During their life incognito,
<>the Pa1n2d2avas lived in the Vira1t2a palace after taking
<>up various jobs. Pa1n5ca1li, under the assumed name
<>Ma1lini1, served Sudes2n2a1 and her daughter Uttara1 as
<>their chaperon. Ki1caka fell in love with Pa1n5ca1li1 at
<>first sight. But, Pa1n5ca1li1 resisted all his advances. Then,
<>he sought the help of his sister Sudes2n2a1 to bring round
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 to him somehow. Sudes2n2a1 asked Ki1caka to be
<>ready on the New Moon day with liquor and rice and
<>promised to send Ma1lini1 (Pa1n5ca1li1) to him. Ordered
<>by Sudes2n2a1, she went to Ki1caka with his plate of food
<>much against her will. Ki1caka caught hold of her, but
<>she ran when the former caught her by the hair, felled
<>her on the floor and kicked her. A Ra1ks2asa, who was
<>deputed for Pa1n5ca1li1's security appeared on the scene in
<>a trice and felled Ki1caka.
<NI>3). {%Ki1caka's Death.%} The very same night with tears in
<>her eyes, Pa1n5ca1li1 told Bhi1ma all about the indecent
<>behaviour. He asked Pa1n5ca1li1 to invite Ki1caka to a
<>secret meeting at a specified place the next night, and
<>promised her that he would remain concealed there
<>and kill Ki1caka. Accordingly Bhi1ma concealed himself
<>the next night in the dancing hall and, as requested by
<>Pa1n5ca1li1, Ki1caka came to the hall at midnight to spend
<>a few hours with Pa1n5ca1li1. Bhi1ma was lying there on
<>a cot, and Ki1caka, mistaking him for Pa1n5ca1li1 kissed
<>him. Bhi1ma caught him in his iron grips and crushed him
<>to death. The next morning, it was the fate of Ki1caka's
<>brothers to lament over his death. The story also was
<>spread that Ki1caka was killed by some Gandharva, the
<>husband of Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>The Upa-Ki1cakas removed the dead body of their
<>brother to the burning ghat. Proclaiming that Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>who was responsible for the death of their brother
<>would also be burnt to death on the same pyre, the
<>Upa-Ki1cakas forcibly took her with them. Hearing the
<>heart-rending cries of Pa1n5ca1li1 Bhi1ma rushed to the spot
<>and killed all the Upa-Ki1cakas and saved Pa1n5ca1li1
<>from death. In the presence of the Vira1t2a king the

<>to carry his merchandise. Once the merchant was [Page411-b+ 63]
<>returning home from Bhadra1cala with his ass loaded
<>with bundles of costly Rudra1ks2as. The old ass fell down
<>dead on the way, the weight of the Rudra1ks2a bundles
<>having been too much for it, and immediately it
<>assumed the form of S4iva and went to Kaila1sa. Even
<>if a man does not know what he is carrying, if he
<>carries sacred things he will certainly attain salvation,
<>like the ass that attained salvation in this case. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 11th Skandha).
<HI>KILI (PARROT).

<>and when the world appeared to get destroyed the
<>Devas asked Agnideva to persuade S4iva to stop. But,
<>afraid of approaching S4iva Agni ran off and hid him-
<>self in the ocean. The Devas followed him, and animals
<>in the water which were burning with the heat of
<>Agni, told the Devas that Agni was hiding in the sea.
<>But, Agni cursed them all to dumbness, and leaving the
<>ocean hid himself on mount Mandara. The parrots
<>revealed this secret, when Agni cursed them also and
<>made their tongues fold inwards. The Devas and the
<>parrots requested for redemption from the curse.
<>Redemption was granted thus: “Though the tongue
<>be turned inwards your sound will be melodious. Just
<>like the voice of a child your (parrots') sound also will
<>be sweet and wonderful.”

<>the eighth son of Devaki1 would kill him he had ordered

<>Accordingly the first-born son of Devaki1 was taken to
<>him, but was returned to the parents as Kam3sa thought [Page413-a+ 65]
<>that he was not his enemy. He was brought up under
<>the name Ki1rtima1n. Afterwards Na1rada visited Kam3sa
<>and explained to him about his former birth, the

<>corpses, but later on, in appreciation of his valour
<>granted him the boon that if anyone saw the Lord
<>without thinking first about Ki1rtimukha, he would
<>meet with his down-fall. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Chapter 50).
<HI>KI1RTISENA. Son of the brother of the Na1ga chief
<>Va1suki. He made a love-marriage with S4ruta1rtha1
<>daughter of a brahmin, and a child was born to them.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2hakalambaka).
<HI>KI1RTISENA1. A heroine who has firmly established her
<>reputation in Sanskrit literature. An exceptionally
<>good woman, Ki1rtisena1 was the daughter of a merchant
<>called Dhanapa1la in Pa1t2ali1putra, and was married by
<>another merchant called Devasena. Once Devasena
<>left the country for purposes of trade, and during his
<>absence from home the mother-in-law of Ki1rtisena1 shut
<>her up in a dark room. But, with the help of an iron
<>rod, which fortunately came to her hands she made a
<>hole in the room at night, and through it escaped
<>from captivity. Hungry and thirsty, Ki1rtisena1 travelled
<>a long distance in the forest, and at night climbed a
<>tree and rested thereon. Presently a Ra1ks2asa woman
<>with her children came to the foot of the tree.
<NI>During this period the King of Vasudattapura was
<>suffering from pain in the head because a bug entered
<>his ear and multiplied there in numbers. All the
<>physicians gave up the case as incurable. But, the
<>Ra1ks2asi1 at the foot of the tree advised the following
<>cure for the King's illness to her children:--“Anoint
<>the King's head with ghee and make him lie in the
<>sun at noon. After that insert a small tube into his
<>ear, and keep the other end of the tube in a pot full
<>of water. Then the bugs will come out from the ear
<>into the water, and the King will be cured of his ill-
<>ness.
<NI>Ki1rtisena1, who heard this medical advice from her
<>seat on top of the tree disguised herself as a physician,
<>went to the palace and cured the King of his troubles.
<>In her disguise, she continued to live in the palace as
<>a friend of the King. Shortly, her husband Devasena,
<>came there and they were happily reunited. The King
<>gave them costly presents. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madana-
<>man5juka1lambaka, Taran3ga 3).
<HI>KIS2KINDHA1. An ancient kingdom of the monkeys in
<>South India. This kingdom is mentioned both in the
<>Ra1ma1yan2a and the Maha1bha1rata.
<>During the Ra1ma1yan2a period a monkey King called
<>R2ks2ara1ja was the ruler of Kis2kindha1. He was childless. [Page413-b+ 65]
<NI>Once upon a time a son called Ba1li was born to Arun2i1-
<>devi1 by Indra, and another son called Sugri1va was born
<>to her by Su1rya. (See under Arun2a). Both the boys
<>were brought up in the A1s4rama of sage Gautama.
<>When they grew up, Indra handed them over to R2ks2a-
<>ra1ja, and thus Ba1li and Sugri1va came to Kiskindha1.
<>After the death of R2ks2ara1ja, Ba1li became King of Kis2-
<>kindha1 and Sugri1va lived in the service of his brother.
<>At that time there was a very mighty Asura called
<>Dundubhi. Finding no one fit to fight with, he challeng-
<>ed Varun2a. Varun2a directed him to Himava1n, whose
<>peaks he rent asunder, and played with. Then Himava1n
<>told Dundubhi that he was of a peaceful nature and
<>that Ba1li would be a match for him (Dundubhi).
<>Accordingly Dundubhi fought with Ba1li and got killed.
<>Ba1li cast away the corpse of Dundubhi. The blood
<>oozing out from the nose of Dundubhi fell on the
<>body of sage Matan3ga who was engaged in penance on
<>the peak R2s2yamu1ka. Bymeans of his divine powers, the
<>sage found out the origin of the blood contaminating his
<>body, and cursed that Ba1li would die the moment he
<>set foot on the mountain.
<NI>Dundubhi's son Ma1ya1vi1 was enraged at the death of
<>his father. He went to Kis2kindha1 to take revenge on
<>Ba1li, but got defeated by the latter in fighting. Ma1ya1vi1
<>took to his heels; Ba1li followed him, and Sugri1va follow-
<>ed his brother. Ma1ya1vi1 took refuge in a cave followed
<>by Ba1li, and Sugri1va waited at the mouth of cave. Even
<>after one year neither Ba1li nor Ma1ya1vi1 emerged out of
<>the cave, but Sugri1va saw blood coming out of the
<>cave and heard Ma1ya1vi1 roaring. Taking it for granted
<>that Ba1li was killed, Sugri1va closed the mouth of the
<>cave, returned to Kis2kindha1, and at the instance of his
<>subjects assumed kingship.
<NI>But, Ba1li forced open the cave, hurried back to his
<>kingdom, and interpreting the action of Sugri1va as
<>one purposely done to usurp the throne, drove
<>Sugri1va away and took for himself Sugri1va's wife. Thus
<>Ba1li became again King of Kis2kindha1.
<NI>There is a mountain called “Ba1li-kera1-mala”--mountain
<>prohibited to Ba1li--in the eastern region of the former
<>princely kingdom of Travancore. Is it in any way con-
<>nected with R2s2yamu1ka1cala?
<NI>Sugri1va founded a new kingdom at R2s2yamu1ka moun-
<>tain. Mainda, Dvivida, Hanu1ma1n and Ja1mbava1n
<>were the ministers of Sugri1va. It was while Sugri1va was
<>thus living on R2s2yamu1ka1cala that Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>came that way in the course of their search for Si1ta1. In
<>accordance with the agreement made between Sugri1va
<>and Ra1ma, the latter killed Ba1li and crowned Sugri1va
<>as the King of Kis2kindha1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2-
<>kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, and Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 280).
<NI>During the triumphal tour of Sahadeva in the South he
<>fought against Kis2kindha1, and after seven days' fighting
<>the monkeys saw Sahadeva off with a present of costly
<>gems.
<NI>“Sahadeva fought against the monkey chiefs like
<>Mainda, Dvivida etc. for seven days, but neither of
<>them got exhausted, and the monkey chiefs, with
<>affection and gratitude asked Sahadeva to depart with
<>gems.” (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31).
<NI>During this period nothing was heard of Sugri1va,
<>Hanu1ma1n and Ja1mbava1n in Kis2kindha1. Might be
<>Sugri1va was no more. Hanu1ma1n, after the death of S4ri1 [Page414-a+ 65]
<>Ra1ma, lived in Gandhama1dana in Kimpurus2avars2a.
<>(Bha1rata and Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha). From the
<>story of Prasena it may be seen that Ja1mbavan left
<>Kis2kindha1 and lived in another cave with his sons
<>and other relations. It was the other two ministers of
<>Sugri1va, Mainda and Dvivida, who were ruling Kis2-
<>kindha1 when Sahadeva went there. The power and
<>prestige of Kis2kindha1 had begun to set by then, and in
<>course of time Kis2kindha1 ceased to exist but in name.
<HI>KIS2KINDHA1GUHA1. A mountainous region in Dhavad2
<>district in South India. Certain scholars hold the view
<>that this was the actual Kis2kindha1.
<HI>KI1T2AKA. A King born from an aspect of the Asura
<>called Krodhavas4a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 60).
<HI>KITAVA(S). An ancient tribe of people. They once
<>visited Yudhis2t2hira with many presents. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 51, Verse 12).
<HI>KOHALA. A Brahmin scholar. It is stated in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 4, that this
<>Brahmin was present at the ‘Sarpa Sattra’ (sacrifice to
<>kill serpents) of Janamejaya. Once Bhagi1ratha gave
<>this hermit as alms one lakh of cows with calves. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 138, Stanza 27).
<HI>KOKA. (Cakrava1ka bird). Ruddy Goose. To know the
<>Pura1n2ic story about the origin of this bird (Ruddy
<>goose) see under ‘Arayanna’ (Swan).
<HI>KOKA1MUKHA. A holy place. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanza 153, that
<>those who bathe in this holy bath will get the faculty
<>of remembering their previous births.
<HI>KOKANADA I. A Ks2atriya King of ancient India. It
<>is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, that at the
<>time of the regional conquest of Arjuna, this King fell
<>at his feet and sought refuge.
<HI>KOKANADA II. A warrior of Skanda. (M.B. Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 27).
<HI>KOKAVAKA. A country in ancient India. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9).
<HI>KOKILA. See under D2in2d2ika.
<HI>KOKILAKA. A warrior of Skanda. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 73).
<HI>KOLAGIRI. A mountain of South India. (Maha1bha1rata
<>Sabha1 Parva). Sahadeva conquered the people of this
<>mountain.
<HI>KOLA1HALA A famous Asura. In the battle between
<>the Devas and the Asuras carried on by Subrahman2ya,
<>this Asura confronted Ma1lyava1n and was killed. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a; Part IV, Chapter 13).
<HI>KOLASVRU1PA (KOLATTUNA1D2U). After the decline
<>of the second Cera empire in Kerala, several royal
<>families such as Perumpat2appu, Ned2uvirippu, Kolasva-
<>ru1pa, Ven2a1t2u etc. came into power. Some details regard-
<>ing the family of Kolasvaru1pa are given below.
<NI>In ‘Kerala Ma1ha1tmya’, it is given that Paras4ura1ma
<>had made a Soma-Ks2atriya, as King of Cirakkal or
<>Kolattuna1d2u. According to ‘Keralotpatti’ it was Cera-
<>ma1n Peruma1l who did this. Logan says that Kolasva-
<>ru1pa came into being from the children born to the
<>last Peruma1l of the Ven2a1t2u family. In the edicts Vi1ra-
<>ra1ghavapat2t2aya or Ju1tas4a1sana no mention is made
<>about Kolattuna1d2u. Both the families of Ven2a1t2u and
<>Kolattuna1d2u, from very early times had observed
<>the customary rites of taint, pollution, defilement etc.
<>It is said in ‘Keralama1ha1tmya’ that Paras4ura1ma had
<>enthroned the sons of two sisters in both the kingdoms. [Page414-b+ 64]
<>But no documents are available to prove that there
<>was any connection between the two families till the 5th
<>century M.E. (Malaya1lam Era). i.e. 14th century A.D.
<>See under Kollavars2a.
<HI>KOLIKA (KOKILA). This is the name of a rat. Kokila
<>is a character in the story known as Bid2a1lopa1khya1na,
<>told by Na1rada to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Once a cat began to
<>perform penance holding up both of its hands, on the
<>bank of the Gan3ga1. After a long time birds and rats
<>began to come very close to it believing that it would
<>not hurt them. They made the cat their leader. The
<>wicked cat daily ate a rat secretly. Thus the body of
<>the cat grew stronger day by day and there appeared a
<>steady decrease in the number of the rats. Among them
<>there was a wise rat called Kokila. He understood the
<>deceit played by the cat. So proclaiming independence
<>he and his fellows ran away and saved themselves.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 160).
<HI>KOLISARPA. A tribe. Formerly this tribe was of Ks2a-
<>triya Caste. A Brahmin once cursed them and made
<>them S4u1dras. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 33,
<>Stanza 22).
<HI>KOLLAGIREYA. An ancient country in South India.
<>It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, As4vamedha Parva, Chapter
<>83, that Arjuna conquered this country.
<HI>KOLLAVARS2A. (MALAYA1LAM ERA). Several opinions
<>have been brought forward about the starting of the
<>Malaya1lam Era. There is great controversy as to the
<>causes of starting this new era. The opinion of S4an3-
<>kun2n2i Menon is as follows. The King Udayama1rtan2d2a-
<>varma1 called together at Quilon, an assembly of the
<>learned men and astronomers of the time, in Kalivars2a
<>3926 (A.D. 825) and made astronomical researches and
<>taking into account the movements and positions of the
<>various planets in the solar system, started a new era
<>beginning with the month of Cin3n3am (August-Septem-
<>ber). This new era commenced on the 15th of August
<>825 A.D. All the learned men and scholars of the time
<>welcomed this Malaya1lam era. The neighbouring king-
<>doms also recognized this new era. Reckoning of dates
<>based on this Malaya1lam Era is seen in the ‘Madura
<>and Tinnevelly Stone-edicts and copper edicts.’ On
<>the fifth day of Cin3n3am3 of the first year of M.E., five
<>royal families of Travancore met together and took a
<>decision that the festival days of the temples should be
<>reckoned according to the Malaya1lam Era. The contro-
<>versy is not about the starting of the new Era, but the
<>reasons for starting the new era.
<NI>Logan says that the Malaya1lam Era was started in
<>commemoration of the conversion of Cerama1n Peruma1l
<>to Islam and his pilgrimage to Mecca. But there is im-
<>propriety in thinking that the Hindu subjects of a King
<>would commemorate the conversion of their King into
<>Islam religion. Some say that the new era was started
<>to commemorate the erection of a S4aivite temple. An-
<>other argument is that a new era was started in memory
<>of the exhortation of S4ri1 S4an3kara1ca1rya to the Brahmins
<>of Quilon, to do away with the irregularities seen in the
<>Hindu religion. The period of S4an3kara1ca1rya has not
<>yet been decided definitely. The opinion accepted by
<>scholars on this subject is that of K.B. Pathak, accord-
<>ing to whom S4an3kara1ca1rya lived from 787 to 819 A.D.
<>If this is accepted as true, the exhortation made in
<>825 A.D. should be by somebody else and the Malaya1- [Page415-a+ 65]
<>lam Era should have been established for some ot her
<>reasons.
<NI>Another opinion is that the new era was established
<>to commemorate the independence given to the two
<>Kolattiri Kings (North and South) by the Peruma1l. The
<>North Kolattiri family should have begun the new era
<>on the first day of Kanni (the second month) and the
<>South Kolattiri family on the first day of Cin3n3am3
<>(the first month). (Because in Malabar area, the era
<>commences on the first day of Kanni.). Another opinion
<>that is prevalent is that Kollavars2a was started to com-
<>memorate the erection of the two towns of Quilon
<>(North and South). But even two centuries before A.D.
<>825 the town of South Quilon had become famous. So it
<>is an objection to this argument. Some are of opinion
<>that a new era was started in commemoration of
<>S4an3karavijaya (the victory of S4an3kara) due to the
<>fact that the Brahmins of the north and the south
<>alike accepted the teachings of S4an3kara1ca1rya. But it is
<>difficult to believe that the northerners and the souther-
<>ners accepted the teachings of S4an3kara1ca1rya on a parti-
<>cular date and issued a declaration to that effect and
<>started a new era. Some connect the starting of the
<>New Era with the ‘Tiruvon2am’ a grand festival of the
<>Malaya1lees. But it cannot be believed that a national
<>festival was started by a single man. According to
<>Logan it would appear that the grand festival of Tiru-
<>von2am was started to commemorate the journey of
<>Peruma1l to Mecca. But the conversion episode is more
<>likely to be considered as a blasphemy and the Kings
<>and people of Malaya1la land are not likely to com-
<>memorate it. Prof. Sundaran Pillai has cut all the
<>arguments given above and brought forward a new
<>theory. His inference is that the new Era is the trans-
<>formation of an old era known as Saptars2ivatsara
<>(year of the seven sages) or S4a1strasam3vatsara (scien-
<>tific year) which prevailed throughout India and
<>is still in force in Kas4mi1ra. In A.D. 897 Saptars2i-
<>Vatsara was 4972 and it was known as merely 72, and
<>that if all the hundreds are taken away, the remaining
<>figure will be the same as that of the Kollavars2a. That
<>is, at the expiry of each century the Saptars2ivatsara
<>begins as one, two and so on. But the Saptars2ivatsara
<>begins in the month of Met2am (9th month) where-
<>as Kollavars2a begins in Cin3n3am. He explains this differ-
<>ence also. His opinion is that the Nambu1tiri Brahmins
<>took some time to reach the country of Malaya1la from
<>North Indian countries and they had been using their
<>Saptars2ivatsara up to the time of their arrival in Mala-
<>ya1la and after their arrival they adopted some slight
<>modifications in the era according to the requirements
<>of the new settlement, and renewed the Saptars2ivatsara.
<>Gopala lyer, the great exponent of the Veda1nta
<>philosophy, says as follows about Kollavars2a in his
<>‘Chronology of Ancient India’: “Kaliyuga and
<>Kollavars2a commenced in B.C. 1176.” But Kollavars2a
<>is divided into groups of recurring thousands. This
<>has a close connection with Saptars2i Vatsara, which
<>also might have commenced in B.C. 1176. The year
<>mentioned above completed 2000 by A.D. 824. The
<>third recurring thousand begins in A.D. 825, under the
<>name Kollavars2a.
<NI>Princent, Buchanan and Burnell are the three memo-
<>rable western scholars who have expressed their
<>opinions about Kollavars2a. Pr2incent connected [Page415-b+ 63]
<>Kollavars2a with Paras4ura1ma. Buchanan said that
<>the Malaya1lees have a recurring of every millennium.
<>Burnell has stated in his book “South Indian Paleo-
<>graphy”, that the theory of recurring Millennium is
<>wrong.
<NI>An astronomer who was a contemporary of the King
<>who established the Malaya1lam era has stated in his
<>work called ‘S4an3karana1ra1yan2i1ya’ (a manuscript in
<>Palm leaves) that an astronomical movement was
<>reckoned and a new era was started at Quilon. This
<>palm leaf manuscript is kept in the Manuscripts
<>Library at Trivandrum.

<HI>KOT2T2UVA1. (Yawning, Gape). In Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 6, there is a story explaining how the living

<>Brahma1, Vr2ttra1sura swallowed Indra. The Devas were
<>filled with fea and approaching Brhaspati they re-
<>presented their grievance. According to the instruction
<>of Br2haspati the Devas caused Vr2ttra1sura to gape.
<>After opening the mouth he found it difficult to shut,
<>and the mouth remained open. In the meanwhile
<>Indra jumped out of Vr2tra through the mouth. Gape
<>came into existence from that time. (For details see

<>Kramapa had a brother named Sahis2n2u. (Agni Pura1n2a
<>Chapter 20).
<HI>KRAMAPA1T2HA. A method of teaching the Vedas. It
<>is due to the insistence on strict adherence to this
<>method of teaching that even after thousands of years
<>variations have not crept into the original texts of the
<>Vedas which form the earliest literature. There is a
<>portion called ‘word study’ (Pada Pa1t2ha) in the Vedas
<>(the scripture). Every word in the Veda is separated
<>from its prefixes and suffixes. The second step is Krama-
<>pa1t2ha or the study of joining prefixes and suffixes to
<>each word got by the first step. Next step is Jat2a1pa1t2ha
<>in which words are combined with their prefixes and
<>suffixes. To guard against the creeping in of mistakes
<>in this step, the next step which is known as Ghana-
<>pa1t2ha is taught. In this step the first step of Padapa1t2ha
<>and the second step of Krama pa1t2ha are mixed together [Page416-b+ 64]
<>and intermingled from beginning to end and end to
<>beginning. There are rules to make combined words by
<>using prefixes and suffixes. These rules are called
<>Pra1tis4a1khya. Because the Vedas are taught in this way
<>with so much attention and care, their texts have never
<>been subjected to changes and variations.
<HI>KRATHA I. A Ks2atriya King. He was the rebirth of

<HI>KRAUN5CA I. An Asura. In Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 57 it is mentioned that this Asura was killed by
<>Subrahman2ya.
<HI>KRAUN5CA II. A mountain. There is a story about this
<>mountain. Long ago there lived an Asura named
<>Kraun5ca. He was leading a wicked life and was
<>haughty and arrogant. Once Agastya went to Kaila1sa
<>and worshipped S4iva. Ka1veri1devi1 also was standing
<>close by, worshipping S4iva. God S4iva appeared before
<>Agastya and told him that he might ask for any boon.
<>He requested for the power to push down Vindhya by
<>kicking and to establish a holy Ti1rtha (bath) on the
<>earth. S4iva granted the boons. For making the ti1rtha
<>S4iva turned Ka1veri1 into a river and placed her in the
<>water-pot of Agastya. As Agastya was returning from
<>Kaila1sa with Ka1veri1 in his water-pot, Kraun5ca the
<>Asura took the shape of a mountain and hindered his
<>way. The Asura caused a heavy rain too. Agastya
<>wandered through the forest without finding the path
<>for days. At last he realized the cause. He took a few
<>drops of water from his waterpot and with chanting of
<>Mantras and meditation threw the drops at the Asura
<>with the curse that he would stand there for ever as a
<>mountain. He said that he would be liberated from the
<>curse when pierced by the arrow of Subrahman2ya, the
<>son of S4iva. From that day onwards Kraun5ca the Asura
<>had been standing there as a mountain. That mountain
<>was called ‘The mountain of Kraun5ca.’ (Skanda
<>Pura1n2a, Asura Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>There is another statement in Harivam3s4a, Chapter 18,
<>that the mountain Kraun5ca was the son of the moun-
<>tain Maina1ka, the son of Mena1.
<NI>Subrahman2ya fought a terrible battle with the Asuras.
<>Many died. Ba1n2a1sura, the son of Maha1bali, fled from
<>the battlefield and hid himself inside the mountain
<>Kraun5ca. Subrahman2ya cleft the mountain into two
<>with the arrow given by Agni (Fire-god). Thus
<>Kraun5ca1sura was liberated from the curse. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 46).
<NI>In ‘Meghadu1ta’ Ka1lida1sa mentions about the cleavage
<>in the mountain Kraun5ca. In Maha1bha1rata, Vana [Page417-b+ 65]
<>Parva, Chapter 225, Stanza 33, mention is made that
<>through this cleavage swans and vultures fly to Maha1-
<>meru. (For the story of how Paras4ura1ma cleft the

<NI>Once, while the hermit Jamadagni was performing
<>sacrificial offerings to the Manes, Krodha came there
<>and secretly put poison in the pudding prepared from
<>the milk of the sacrificial cow. Even though the hermit
<>knew this he did not get angry. Seeing this, Krodha
<>became afraid of the hermit and approaching him said
<>“Oh, hermit! I thought that the Bha1rgavas (those

<>the death of Dron2a in the great war. (Stri1 Parva,
<>Chapter 23, Verse 33).
<P>The terms S4a1radvati1 and Gautami1 are used as
<>synonyms of Kr2pi1 in the Maha1bha1rata.
<HI>KR2S4A. I. A friend of sage S4r2n3gi1. Since Kr2s4a underwent
<>a lot of sacrifices for the protection of dharma (righte-
<>ousness) his body became very Kr2s4a (lean). Hence he
<>was called Kr2s4a. It was Kr2s4a, who told S4r2n3gi1 about
<>King Pari1ks2it who had once thrown a dead snake round
<>his (S4r2n3gi1's) father's neck. (A1di Parva, Chapters 41
<>and 42).
<HI>KR2S4A II. A prominent serpent born in the Aira1vata
<>family. The serpent was reduced to ashes at the serpent
<>yajn5a of Janamejaya. (A1di Parva, Chapter 57, Verse
<>11).
<HI>KR2S4A III. A great sage endowed with divine powers.
<>He was also present in the company of sages who visit-
<>ed Bhi1s2ma on his arrow-bed. (Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 26, Verse 7).
<HI>KR2S4ADRATHA. Son of Titiks2a, brother of the famous
<>emperor S4ibi. (Bha1gavata, 9th Skandha). [Page420-a+ 65]
<HI>KR2S4AKA. A na1ga born in the Kas4yapa dynasty.
<>(Udyogaparva, Chapter 106, Verse 15).
<HI>KR2S4A1NU. The sage who stood guard over Soma at the
<>Yajn5a conducted by sage Kutsa. (R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1,
<>Anuva1ka 16, Su1kta 112).
<HI>KR2S4A1S4VA I. The Praja1pati called Kr2s4a1s4va married
<>Jaya1 and Suprabha1 the daughters of Daks2apraja1pati
<>and to both were born fifty sons each. All the sons were
<>really arrows called Sam3ha1ra. Vis4va1mitra, by the power
<>of penance made these hundred sons (arrows) of Kr2s4a1-
<>s4va his own. It was these arrows, which Vis4va1mitra
<>gave to S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Cantos 21 and 26).
<HI>KR2S4A1S4VA II. A king of the solar dynasty. (Bha1gavata,
<>9th Skandha).
<HI>KR2S4A1S4VA III. A King who served Yama in his court.
<>(Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 17).
<P>Once he came down to earth in Indra's Vima1na to

<>PURUVAM3S4A).
<HI>KR2S2I1VALA. An ancient sage who lived in Indra's
<>court. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 13).
<HI>KR2S2N2A (S4RI1 KR2S2N2A). Born in the Ya1dava dynasty
<>as the son of Vasudeva and Devaki1, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was the
<>ninth of the ten incarnations of Maha1vis2n2u.

<>A1naka, Sr2n5jaya, Ka1ka1ni1ka, S4ya1maka, Vatsa, Ka1vu1ka
<>and Vasu were born to King S4u1rasena by his wife
<>Ma1ris2a1. Of those ten sons Vasudeva married Devaki1,
<>the sister of Kam3sa. He had also a second wife called
<>Rohin2i1 and she was the mother of Balabhadrara1ma.
<NI>2) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's former births.%} Owing to a curse of
<>Varun2a, Kas4yapapraja1pati was born on earth as
<>Vasudeva and his (Kas4yapa) wives Aditi and Surasa1
<>were born as Devaki1 and Rohin2i1. (See under Kas4yapa
<>and Aditi). Like this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a also had previous births.
<>Once upon a time from the heart of Brahma1 was
<>born the Praja1pati called Dharma, who was very truth-
<>ful and wedded to righteous living according to the
<>injunctions of the Vedas. He wedded the ten daughters
<>of Daks2apraja1pati, and four sons called Hari, Kr2s2n2a
<>Nara and Na1ra1yan2a were born to him. Hari and
<>Kr2s2n2a turned out to be great Yogins, and Nara and
<>Na1ra1yan2a ascetics. Narana1ra1yan2as performed penance
<>to please Brahma1 for a thousand years at Badarik-
<>a1s4rama in the valley of the Hima1layas. Celestial
<>women, whom Indra had deputed to break their
<>penance, approached them and requested them to take
<>them (celestial women) as their wives. Ascetic Na1ra1-
<>yan2a who got angry at the celestial women's request
<>was about to curse them when sage Nara intervened
<>and pacified him. Then sage Na1ra1yan2a told them
<>thus:--“You must protect my Vrata (penance) in [Page420-b+ 64]
<>this life. In that case, in the next birth I shall satisfy
<>your desire. In the 28th Dva1parayuga I will be
<>incarnating on earth on behalf of the Devas. Then you
<>also may be born as princesses. I shall incarnate as
<>Kr2s2n2a in the Yadu dynasty and marry all of you.
<>(Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<NI>Accordingly sage Na1ra1yan2a was born as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in
<>the Yadu dynasty, and sage Nara was born as Arjuna to
<>be his companion.
<NI>The curse of Bhr2gu the great sage also contributed to
<>Maha1vis2n2u's incarnating himself as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Once
<>in a war which lasted for 100 years between the Devas
<>and the Asuras most of the latter were killed. Then
<>S4ukra, preceptor of the Asuras went to Mount
<>Kaila1sa to secure exceptional weapons, and the Asuras
<>took refuge under Ka1vyama1ta1, the mother of S4ukra.
<>Devendra sought Maha1vis2n2u's aid, and he cut off
<>Ka1vyama1ta1's head with his Cakra (discus). Bhr2gu
<>was enraged at this killing of a woman. He cursed that
<>Maha1vis2n2u should be born as man. Owing to various
<>reasons like the above Maha1vis2n2u happened to be
<>born as man in the Ya1dava dynasty, as the son of
<>Vasudeva. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Vasudeva's wedding.%} To S4u1rasena, the Ya1dava King
<>of Mathura1puri1 was born a son called Vasudeva, and
<>Devaki1 was born as the grand-daughter of Devaka, the
<>brother of Ugrasena, another Ya1dava King. Devaki1
<>was the sister of Kam3sa. Devaki1 was given in marriage
<>to Vasudeva with a dowry of twelve bha1ras (a
<>particular weight) of gold and a chariot. Kam3sa
<>acted as charioteer in the wedding procession during
<>which a celestial voice addressed Kam3sa as follows:--
<>‘Asya1h2 tva1m as2t2amagarbho hanta1’ (Her eighth son
<>will kill you). As soon as he heard the celestial voice
<>Kam3sa stood up in the chariot ablaze with rage. He
<>caught hold of Devaki1 by her hair and raised his
<>sword to cut her throat. All the conciliatory words of
<>Vasudeva failed to pacify Kam3sa. Then Vasudeva
<>promised to hand over to Kam3sa all the children born
<>to Devaki1 immediately after their birth. Accordingly
<>Kam3sa left them alone.
<NI>4) {%First-born son of Vasudeva.%} The first-born child of
<>Vasudeva was duly handed over to Kam3sa. But, he
<>returned the child to its parents as, according to the
<>celestial voice the first-born child was not to be his
<>enemy. Vasudeva and Devaki1 brought it up under the
<>name Ki1rtima1n. On one of those days Na1rada visited
<>Kam3sa and told him about his previous life, the
<>object of Kr2s2n2a's incarnation etc. Then it was that
<>Kam3sa realised how fatal to him was the existence of
<>Vasudeva and Devaki1, and he hurried up to them and
<>killed the child by dashing its head against a rock. He
<>also kept them chained in prison.
<NI>5) {%Kam3sa's excitement.%} The information imparted by
<>Na1rada upset Kam3sa much. He shut his father
<>Ugrasena in prison and himself became King. He
<>deputed Asuras like Pralamba, Ca1n2u1ra, Tr2n2a1varta,
<>Mus2t2ika, Aris2t2a, Kes4i1, Dhenuka, Agha, Vivida and
<>Pu1tana1 to harass the Ya1davas, the Andhakas and the
<>Vr2s2n2is. After the death of Ki1rtima1n, Devaki1, in the
<>prison, delivered five sons. (See under Kam3sa. Para 2
<>for the previous history of the first six sons of Devaki1).
<>Kam3sa killed all the five children also as soon as they
<>were born. [Page421-a+ 65]
<NI>6) {%Birth of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} The Asuras killed in the old
<>Deva1sura war were later born as cruel and evil Kings
<>on earth. The burden of such Kings having become
<>too much for her, goddess Earth, in the guise of a cow
<>complained about it to Brahma1 who took her to S4iva
<>who too could not find a solution to the problem posed
<>by Bhu1midevi1. So, all of them accompanied by the
<>Devas approached Maha1vis2n2u and prayed for the
<>redress of their grievance. Maha1vis2n2u sent them back
<>comforted by the assurance that he would be born as
<>the son of Vasudeva and Devaki1 to solve the problem.
<>He also arranged the Devas to be born as Gopas and
<>the Apsara1 women as Gopika1s on earth for his
<>assistance.
<NI>Devaki1 conceived for the 7th time, and it was an aspect
<>of Ananta. Maha1vis2n2u instructed Ma1ya1devi1 thus:
<>“You go to the earth and transfer the child in Devaki1's
<>womb to that of Rohin2i1, the second wife of Vasudeva
<>and after that, at the very time of my birth you
<>should be born as daughter of Yas4oda1, wife of
<>Nandagopa. You would be worshipped by the world
<>in various names like Ambika1, Na1ra1yan2i1, Can2d2ika1,
<>Durga1, Bhadraka1li1 etc. The child transferred by you to
<>the womb of Rohin2i1 will become known as San3kars2an2a,
<>Balabhadra and Ra1ma.
<NI>Accordingly Ma1ya1devi1 transferred the child in Devaki1's
<>womb to that of Rohin2i1, and it was given out that the
<>seventh child of Devaki1 was aborted in the womb.
<>Devaki1 conceived for the eighth time, and on As2t2ami1
<>day in the month of Sim3ha (Leo, August-September)
<>when the Bra1hma stars were collected on the same day
<>was S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a born. Maha1vis2n2u incarnated himself
<>as Kr2s2n2a with the conch, the discus, the club and the
<>lotus flower in his four hands. Vasudeva saluted the
<>marvellous child, and the chain that bound himself
<>and Devaki1 broke asunder, and the new-born child
<>spoke thus to Vasudeva:--“In Sva1yambhuva Manvan-
<>tara the Praja1pati called Sutapas with his wife Pr2s4ni
<>meditated upon me for 12,000 years, and when I
<>appeared to them and asked them to choose any boon
<>they prayed for my being born as their son. In the
<>next life Sutapas was born as Kas4yapa and Pr2s4ni as
<>Aditi, and I incarnated in the form of Va1mana
<>(Dwarf) as their son. Afterwards Kas4yapa and Aditi
<>took various births, and I too took various births as
<>their son. Now also, Kas4yapa and Aditi, are born as
<>Vasudeva and Devaki1. Just at this time a daughter
<>has been born to Nandagopa and Yas4oda1 at Gokula.
<>You shall take me over there and replace me with the
<>child born at Gokula.” After having told Vasudeva
<>the above facts Kr2s2n2a assumed the form of an ordinary
<>child and lay by the side of its mother. At mid-night
<>when the guards at the prison house were deep in sleep
<>the doors of the prison opened by themselves. Vasudeva
<>with the child Kr2s2n2a, started for Gokula and on his
<>way the river Yamuna1 changed its course for him to
<>proceed. The doors of Yas4oda1's house were open.
<>Owing to the divine prowess of Ma1ya1devi1, the child of
<>Yas4oda1, everybody in the house went into deep sleep.
<>Vasudeva placed Kr2s2n2a by the side of Ys4odaa1 and
<>returned home with her child. As soon as he had thus
<>returned the prison-guards woke up and reported to
<>Kam3sa about the delivery of a child by Devaki1.
<>Kam3sa rushed to the house, caught hold of the child
<>and was about to dash it against the rock when lo! [Page421-b+ 64]
<>the child slipped free of his hands and rose in the sky
<>wherefrom it spoke as follows:--
<NI>Oh! unrighteous and cruel Kam3sa! thy prowess is
<>not to be exhibited against women. Thy killer is born
<>on earth, and search for him everywhere. (S4iva Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 1).
<NI>7) {%Colour of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was dark in colour and Balabhadra white. There is a
<>story in the Maha1bha1rata to explain this difference in
<>their colour. The Devas informed Maha1vis2n2u of their
<>decision to incarnate themselves on earth for the
<>annihilation of the evil and cruel people. Pleased at
<>their decision Vis2n2u plucked from his head a black
<>hair and also a white hair and threw them on the
<>ground, and he said that the black hair would enter
<>Devaki1 and be born as Kr2s2n2a while the white one
<>would enter Rohin2i1 and be born as Balabhadra.
<>Accordingly Kr2s2n2a became of the colour of the cloud
<>(black) and Balabhadra white in colour. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 199, Verse 31).
<NI>8) {%The incidents during the childhood of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%}
<>(1) {%Pu1tana1moks2a (Salvation to Pu1tana1).%} Pu1tana1, a
<>Ra1ks2asi1 and one of the assassins deputed by Kam3sa to
<>search out and kill Kr2s2n2a, went to Kr2s2n2a's house
<>disguised as a Gopa woman and fed him on her breasts.
<>But the child extracted her life also with her breast-
<>milk, and she assumed her original form and fell down
<>dead.
<NI>(2) {%S4akat2a1sura killed.%} Kam3sa next deputed the Asura
<>called S4akat2a to kill Kr2s2n2a. He approached the
<>sleeping Kr2s2n2a in the form of a cart and raised great
<>sound. Kr2s2n2a jumped awake and kicked the cart into
<>hundreds of pieces. (See under S4akat2a).
<NI>(3) {%Killed Tr2n2a1varta1sura.%} Tr2n2a1varta, son of Ta1raka1sura,
<>at the behest of Kam3sa went to Amba1d2i in an invisible
<>(formless) manner. Yas4oda1 was then breast-feeding
<>child Kr2s2n2a, and the child appeared to gradually
<>increase in weight. Yas4oda1 tried to lay the child on
<>the bed, but had to lay him on the ground as it was too
<>heavy for her to lift up to the bed. At once, Tr2n2a1-
<>varta, in the form of a whirl-wind, rose up to the sky
<>carrying Kr2s2n2a along with him. Amba1d2i (Gokula)
<>was chokingly filled with clouds of dust; the Gopa1las
<>cried out. But, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a clasped round the Asura's
<>neck and rested, and on account of the child's weight
<>he could not rise any more. The child hardened its
<>hands around the Asura's throat and he got killed and
<>fell down with a thud on a rock. Yas4oda1 hurriedly
<>took the child in her hands and covered it with kisses.
<>(See under Tr2n2a1varta).
<NI>(4) {%Naming.%} During this period the famous sage
<>Garga visited Kr2s2n2a at Amba1d2i, and he informed
<>Vasudeva and Devaki1 of the actual facts relating to
<>Kr2s2n2a. The son of Rohin2i1 was brought there, and the
<>sage named him Ra1ma, and Yas4oda1's child Kr2s2n2a,
<>and blessed them. Thenceforth Ra1ma and Kr2s2n2a grew
<>up in Amba1d2i as the apple of the people's eyes. (See
<>under Garga).
<NI>(5) {%All the worlds in Kr2s2n2a's mouth.%} The Gopika1s once
<>saw Kr2s2n2a eating mud and informed Yas4oda1 of it, and
<>she, in great anger, opened the child's mouth to look
<>for the sand when she saw there all the worlds including
<>herself and she closed her eyes in great alarm.
<>(Bha1gavata 10th Skandha). [Page422-a+ 64]
<NI>(6) {%Kr2s2n2a drags Ulu1khala. (Mortar).%} Yas4oda1 was once
<>breast-feeding Kr2s2n2a when she noticed milk flowing
<>out of the boiling pan, and she put the child on the
<>floor and went to attend to the boiling milk. Angry at
<>this Kr2s2n2a broke the milk-pot by throwing a stone at
<>it. Yas4oda1 then tried to bind the child to the mortar
<>with a cord. But, any number of cords could not
<>reach round the child's waist. At this trouble of his
<>mother Kr2s2n2a decided to oblige her and then the first
<>cord itself sufficed to bind him round the mortar. But,
<>Kr2s2n2a then began running, dragging the mortar
<>behind him. Dragging the Ulu1khala behind him he
<>passed through a narrow gap between two trees. The
<>trees were shaken and at once the trees rose up in the
<>sky as two Devas. The two trees were actually
<>Nalaku1bara and Man2igri1va, the sons of Vais4ravan2a,
<>both of whom had been cursed into the form of trees
<>by Na1rada. (See under Nalaku1bara).
<NI>(7) {%Vatsa1sura killed.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma
<>were one day, engaged in sports along with the Gopa1las
<>on the banks of river Ka1lindi1. At that time an Asura
<>sent by Kam3sa got into the ranks of the cows disguised
<>as a cow. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a understood it; Balabhadra also
<>pointed out the new ‘cow’ to him. Then Kr2s2n2a leisure-
<>ly went towards the herd of cattle, lifted the new ‘cow’
<>by its legs and tail and dashed it against a peepal
<>tree. The peepal tree and the one next to it were
<>broken, and thus ended the life of Vatsa1sura.
<NI>(8) {%Baka killed%} On another occasion Kam3sa deputed
<>Baka1sura, brother of Pu1tana1 to kill Kr2s2n2a. He assumed
<>the form of a bird, and lay there on the road with his
<>fierce mouth wide open. The Gopa1las were terror-
<>stricken. But, Kr2s2n2a entered the cave-like mouth of the
<>bird leaving his companions behind. The Asura
<>closed his mouth, and the Gopa1las cried out in fear
<>and agony. But, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a stirred round and round
<>within Baka's stomach and he was forced to vomit
<>Kr2s2n2a out. Along with Kr2s2n2a he vomited blood and
<>died. (See under Baka).
<NI>(9) {%Killed Agha1sura.%} Agha1sura, brother of Baka and
<>Pu1tana1, deputed by Kam3sa to kill Kr2s2n2a assumed the
<>form of a serpent and with its mouth opened like a
<>cave lay on the road used by the Gopa1las. The stench
<>that emanated from its mouth vitiated the atmosphere.
<>The Gopa1las including Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra entered
<>the serpent's mouth, and immediately its entire body
<>shook and it vomited blood. Life escaped through its
<>broken stomach. The Gopa1las came out of it and fell
<>down unconscious. But, at the very sight of Kr2s2n2a they
<>regained consciousness. (See under Agha).
<NI>(10) {%Brahma1 placed in ridiculous situation.%} On another
<>occasion Brahma1 saw Maha1visn2u, in the assumed form
<>of man, playing on the banks of the Ka1lindi1 along with
<>Balabhadra and his companions. To test whether God
<>possessed powers in the assumed form of man also
<>Brahma1 carried away the cattle of the Gopa1las. The
<>Gopa1las were naturally upset at the disappearance of
<>their cows. After consoling them Kr2s2n2a searched for
<>the cattle on the heights of mount Govardhana and in
<>the forest. But, the cattle were to be found nowhere,
<>and when Kr2s2n2a returned to the banks of the Ka1lindi1
<>the Gopa1las too had disappeared. Divining the reason
<>for the whole affair by his divine powers, Kr2s2n2a created
<>both the Gopa1las and the cows with his divine powers. [Page422-b+ 65]
<NI>One year passed by thus, and one day Kr2s2n2a and his
<>companions with their cattle went to the top of
<>Govardhana. Brahma1 was alarmed to find Kr2s2n2a with
<>the artificially created Gopa1las and the cattle, and
<>while he was looking at them the colour of all of them
<>began changing and within minutes they put on the
<>form of Vis2n2u. Moreover, he saw another Brahma1 and
<>Brahmaloka. Upset and alarmed by the whole
<>phenomenon he sang the praises of Maha1vis2n2u at which
<>his illusion was lifted and he saw the actual Kr2s2n2a, the
<>Gopa1las and the cattle.
<NI>(11) {%Dhenuka1sura killed.%} There lived in the Kadali1 forest
<>on the banks of the Ka1lindi1 an Asura called Dhenuka
<>with his followers. The forest was thick with palm trees.
<NI>Out of fear of the Asura nobody dared to travel in the
<>forest. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra having heard the
<>story about Dhenuka one day went to the forest with
<>their companions. Balabhadra shook down a lot of the
<>palm fruits, the Gopa1las loudly cheered him. The
<>Asura rushed forth challenging them when Kr2s2n2a and
<>Balabhadra thrashed him to death.
<NI>(12) {%Suppressed Ka1liya.%} There lived in Ka1lindi1 a fierce
<>serpent called Ka1liya with his wife and relations. The
<>trees on the banks of the river were withered and had
<>dried up on account of the poisonous breath emitted by
<>the serpent. One day the Gopa1las and their cattle drank
<>water in the Ka1lindi1 and fell down dead. Then Kr2s2n2a
<>climbed a tree on the banks of the river and jumped
<>into its waters and Ka1liya rushed forward to him with
<>his hoods spread out. Kr2s2n2a stepped on the hoods and
<>danced thereon. Ka1liya vomited blood, got exhausted
<>and prayed to Kr2s2n2a for mercy. At the instance of
<>Kr2s2n2a the serpent with its family emigrated to the
<>Raman2aka island. (See under Ka1liya).
<NI>(13) {%Kr2s2n2a swallows fire.%} When Kr2s2n2a came out of the
<>waters after having suppressed Ka1liya and taking with
<>him the gem presented by Ka1liya, the Gopa1las covered
<>Kr2s2n2a with embraces. People of Amba1d2i came to the
<>banks of the Ka1lindi1 looking out for the children. As the
<>sun had set by now the Ya1davas spent the night there,
<>when a wild fire enveloped them, and they cried out
<>to Kr2s2n2a. Kr2s2n2a swallowed the entire fire. (Bha1gavata,
<>10th Skandha).
<NI>(14) {%Killed Pralamba.%} While the Gopa1las were playing
<>once under the shade of a giant peepal tree called
<>Bha1n2d2i1raka an Asura known as Pralamba joined their
<>games disguised as a Gopa1la. Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra
<>understood the trick. They made all the others take
<>the following pledge, i.e. that all of them would beat
<>one another, and the vanquished should carry about
<>the victor on his head. The beating began, and the
<>Gopa called S4ri1da1man defeated Kr2s2n2a. Vr2s2abha defeat-
<>ed Bhadrasena and Balabhadra defeated Pralamba.
<>According to the pledge S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a carried on his
<>shoulders S4ri1da1man, Bhadrasena carried Vr2s2abha and
<>Pralamba carried Balabhadra. But, Pralamba rose up
<>to the skies with Balabhadra, who broke the former's
<>head, and Pralamba fell down dead in his actual form
<>as an Asura.
<NI>(15) {%Again in wild fire.%} The Gopa1las were once again
<>caught in wild fire at the Mun5ja forest on the banks of
<>the Ka1lindi1. They cried out in great fear when Kr2s2n2a
<>went to them and asked them to remain standing with
<>eyes closed. They obeyed him, and he swallowed the
<>fire as though it were nectar. The Gopa1las were aston- [Page423-a+ 65]
<>ished to find themselves safe when they opened their
<>eyes. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>(16) {%Blessed the wives of Brahmins.%} Kr2s2n2a and his com-
<>panions one day travelled a long way along the banks
<>of the Ka1lindi1. They felt very hungry and Kr2s2n2a advis-
<>ed them to request for food at brahmin houses. They
<>begged for food the wives of brahmins, and the
<>wives happy at Kr2s2n2a's presence there, came with food.
<>Kr2s2n2a blessed them. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>(17) {%Theft of clothes.%} Kr2s2n2a once picked up the clothes
<>of the Gopa women who were bathing in the Ka1lindi1 and
<>climbed to the top of a tree with the clothes and play-
<>ed on his flute. The Gopa women came out of the river
<>and saluted Kr2s2n2a with folded hands. He then returned
<>the clothes to them. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>(18) {%Mount Govardhana used as Umbrella.%} Indra is the
<>rain-God. The people of Amba1d2i used to perform yajn5a

<>the Kauravas. They were victims to all sorts of miseries.
<>Hearing about the sad plight of the Pa1n2d2avas Kr2s2n2a
<>deputed Akru1ra to Hastina1pura to enquire about them.
<>Kunti1devi1, with tears in her eyes, told Akru1ra about
<>the injustice being done against the Pa1n2d2avas by the
<>Kauravas and the continuous attempts being made to kill
<>Bhi1ma. Akru1ra visited important persons like Vidura,

<>succeeded Pa1n2d2u as King, to mete out equal justice to
<>Kauravas as well as to the Pa1n2d2avas. Akru1ra returned

<>Jara1sandha, aided by such famous Kings as Sa1lva,
<>Kalin3ga, Cedira1ja, Dantavaktra and S4is4upa1la besieged
<>Mathura1puri1 with a big army. Ya1dava leaders like
<>Kr2s2n2a, Balabhadra, Uddhava, Akru1ra and Kr2tavarman
<>met the enemies in battle in which many kings got [Page425-a+ 64]
<>killed. Balabhadra met Jara1sandha in duel, but let him
<>off on the request of Kr2s2n2a. But, Jara1sandha, supported
<>by Ba1n2a1sura and others besieged Mathura1 again and
<>again. When Balabhadra attempted to kill Jara1sandha,
<>a celestial voice declared that it was not possible for
<>the former to kill Jara1sandha, and the war, therefore,
<>ended for the time being.
<NI>(5) {%Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra meet Paras4ura1ma.%} The conti-

<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra started for mount Gomantaka
<>the repository of gems and on their way they saw
<>Paras4ura1ma engaged in penance under a peepal tree.
<>Paras4ura1ma told them that there was a kingdom at the
<>foot of the Gomantaka called Karavi1ra ruled by King
<>Sr2ga1lava1sudeva and advised them to kill him and collect

<>Since Sr2ga1lava1sudeva had been killed by Kr2s2n2a and
<>Ra1ma, Jara1sandha attacked Mathura1puri1 again, for the
<>eighteenth time. Though during all the wars Jara1sandha
<>was defeated, by that time the Ya1dava power had been
<>weakened much and so Kr2s2n2a ultimately decided to
<>leave Mathura1 and found another kingdom somewhere
<>else. Kr2s2n2a had two reasons to come to this decision.
<>Firstly, Jara1sandha was the father-in-law of his uncle
<>Kam3sa. Next, it was Jara1sandha's object to conquer
<>Mathura1puri1 for Kam3sa's sons. Taking into considera-
<>tion the above two objects of Jara1sandha, Kr2s2n2a and
<>Ra1ma voluntarily quitted Mathura1 with the Ya1davas
<>and went and lived in the city built for them by Vis4va-
<>karman on an island called Dva1raka1 in the western sea.

<>Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a of Yudhis2t2hira. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>33, Verse 13).

<>(goddess Earth). (Sabha1 Parva, Page 808, Southern
<>text).
<NI>(7) He killed S4is4upa1la. (See under S4is4upa1la).
<NI>(8) He made the clothes of Pa1n5ca1li1 unending when
<>Duryodhana tried to strip her naked in the royal
<>assembly. (See under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<NI>(9) He fought Sa1lva and Saubha. (See under Sa1lva
<>and Saubha).
<NI>(10) He once took Subhadra1 and Arjuna to Dva1raka1.
<>(Vana Parva, Chapter 22; Verses 47, 48).
<NI>(11) He consoled the Pa1n2d2avas at the Ka1myaka
<>forest. (Vana Parva, Chapter 183, Verse 16).
<NI>(12) He ate the bit of a leaf of greens from Pa1n5ca1li1's
<>vessel and was pleased with her. (See under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<NI>(13) Attended the wedding of Abhimanyu at
<>Upaplavyanagara and gave a lot of money to Dharma-
<>putra. (Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 72, Verse 24).
<NI>(14) He sent to the court of King Vira1t2a a messenger,
<>who explained to him the corrupt ways of the
<>Kauravas and the righteousness of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 1).
<NI>31) {%Tested by Na1rada.%} Na1rada wanted to know how
<>Kr2s2n2a managed to satisfy all his 16008 wives. For
<>this purpose he visited their houses and Na1rada was
<>wonder-struck to find Kr2s2n2a engaged in conversation
<>with his wives in all the houses he visited. (Bha1gavata,
<>10th Skandha).
<NI>32) {%Kr2s2n2a blessed Kucela.%} See under Kucela.
<NI>33) {%The story of Santa1nagopa1lam.%} See para 7 (d) under
<>Arjuna.
<NI>34) {%Kr2s2n2a feigned sleep.%} The Kauravas refused to part
<>with half the kingdom to the Pa1n2d2avas, who had
<>returned from their exile in the forest. Both the
<>sides began preparations for war. Duryodhana went to
<>Dva1raka1 to invite Kr2s2n2a to his side, and seeing him
<>at a distance Kr2s2n2a feigned sleep and lay down there.
<>Duryodhana occupied a stool at the head of Kr2s2n2a's
<>bed. Arjuna, who also came to seek his help, stood
<>with folded hands at Kr2s2n2a's feet. It was Arjuna
<>whom Kr2s2n2a first saw on waking up. But Duryodhana
<>told him that it was he who had come first. Kr2s2n2a
<>was in a fix, and he had to promise to help both the
<>sides. He promised his entire army to one side and his
<>personal help, himself without any weapons with him,
<>to the other side, and Arjuna was asked to make his
<>choice first as he was younger than Duryodhana.
<>Arjuna chose Kr2s2n2a without arms and Duryodhana
<>with his infantry. Kr2s2n2a agreed to act as Arjuna's
<>charioteer.
<NI>35) {%As messenger of peace in Kaurava assembly.%} Dharma-
<>putra requested Kr2s2n2a to find out means to avoid war
<>somehow or other and Kr2s2n2a sent a message to Dhr2tara1-
<>s2t2ra through San5jaya but nothing came out of it. Ultima-
<>tely Kr2s2n2a himself decided to visit the Kauravas for which
<>purpose he went first to Dva1raka1 in his chariot with
<>Sa1tyaki. On his way Kr2s2n2a held talks with many a
<>great sage. From Dva1raka1 he returned to Hastina1pura
<>where he visited and consoled Kunti1 at Vidura's house.
<>He had his supper also there. The next day he attended
<>Duryodhana's court and strongly pleaded for the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. But Duryodhana and others ridiculed him
<>and even attempted to take him captive. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a at [Page427-b+ 64]
<>once exhibited his Vis4va-ru1pa (Cosmic form). The
<>Kauravas were frightened to witness Brahma1 on
<>Kr2s2n2a's forehead, S4iva on his chest, A1ditya-Vasu-
<>Rudras in his mouth etc. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a granted the blind
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra divine eyes to see this Vis4varu1pa and he
<>sang the praise of Kr2s2n2a. Kr2s2n2a returned to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas after advising Karn2a to fight on the Pa1n2d2ava
<>side in the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<NI>36) {%Kr2s2n2a in the great war.%} The parts Kr2s2n2a played
<>during the Kuru-Pa1n2d2ava war are briefly given below.
<NI>(1) The Kaurava and the Pa1n2d2ava armies were gather-
<>ed at Kuruks2etra in full battle array and Arjuna, at
<>the sight of the thousands of relations in the opposite
<>camp, became a prey to a great delusion and sat down.
<>Kr2s2n2a then enthused him to fight by giving him
<>advice, which came later to be known as the great
<>Gi1ta1. The Gi1ta1 contains the Sa1n3khya, Yoga, the
<>characteristics of the wise people and the unwise, des-
<>cription about yajn5as, greatness of knowledge, chara-
<>cteristics of Sa1m3khya and nis2ka1makarma, yogins,
<>jn5a1nayoga etc. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapters 26-42).
<NI>(2) At the commencement of the battle, Kr2s2n2a blew
<>aloud his conch Pa1n5cajanya. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter
<>25, Verse 15).
<NI>(3) Kr2s2n2a rushed forward with his Cakra1yudha to
<>kill Bhi1s2ma, who then praised Kr2s2n2a. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 65).
<NI>(4) He prompted Arjuna to kill Bhi1s2ma. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 106, Verse 33).
<NI>(5) He received on his chest the Vais2n2ava1stra shot by
<>Bhagadatta against Arjuna. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 29,
<>Verse 13).
<NI>(6) Consoled Arjuna, who was lamenting over the
<>death of Abhimanyu. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 72).
<NI>(7) Consoled Subhadra1, who was sunk in sorrow at
<>the loss of her son. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 77).
<NI>(8) Consoled the crying Pa1n5ca1li1 and Uttara1. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 78).
<NI>(9) Took Arjuna in a dream to S4iva and got S4iva's
<>blessing for him. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 80).
<NI>(10) He looked after the horses in the battle-field.
<>Dron2a Parva, Chapter 100).
<NI>(11) Prompted Arjuna to kill Duryodhana. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 102).
<NI>(12) Kr2s2n2a created illusory darkness and prompted
<>Arjuna to kill Jayadratha. (See under Jayadratha).
<NI>(13) He lifted the darkness after Jayadratha was killed
<>by Arjuna. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 146).
<NI>(14) As it was not proper for Arjuna and Karn2a to be
<>fighting with each other at mid-night he deputed
<>Ghat2otkaca to fight Karn2a. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>173).
<NI>(15) He consoled Dharmaputra, who was grieving
<>over the death of Ghat2otkaca. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>153).
<NI>(16) He prompted Arjuna to kill Karn2a. (Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 60).
<NI>(17) Withdrew Arjuna from confrontation with Karn2a
<>on the pretext of attending to Dharmaputra, who had
<>been wounded. (Karn2a Parva, Chapter 64).
<NI>(18) A sudden dispute arose between Dharmaputra and
<>Arjuna, who drew his sword to kill the former. And
<>Kr2s2n2a reconciled them by relating the story of Vya1dha
<>and Kaus4ika (For the story see under Vala1ka). [Page428-a+ 64]
<NI>(19) Arjuna got ready to commit suicide: Kr2s2n2a
<>dissuaded him from the attempt. (Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 70).
<NI>(20) Kr2s2n2a again prompted Arjuna to kill Karn2a.
<NI>(21) In the fierce battle that ensued between Arjuna
<>and Karn2a, Kr2s2n2a pressed down the platform of the
<>chariot when the latter shot the na1ga1stra (the serpent
<>arrow). The arrow flew off with Arjuna's crown.
<>(Karn2a Parva, Chapter 90).
<NI>(22) Arjuna killed Karn2a after which Kr2s2n2a prompted
<>Dharmaputra to kill S4alya. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 7).
<NI>(23) Kr2s2n2a prompted Bhi1ma to kill Duryodhana in an
<>illusory battle. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(24) As requested by Yudhis2t2hira Kr2s2n2a left the
<>battle-field for Hastina1pura and returned after con-
<>soling Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 62).
<NI>(25) Kr2s2n2a cursed As4vattha1ma1 who released arrows
<>against pregnant women. (See under As4vattha1ma1).
<NI>(26) Asked Bhi1s2ma to instruct Yudhis2t2hira on dharma
<>(righteousness). (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 51).
<NI>(27) He granted the boon to Bhi1s2ma lying on the bed of
<>arrows that he would not feel hunger and thirst and
<>that his intellect would function powerfully as long as
<>he was discoursing on dharma. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>52).
<NI>(28) He related to Arjuna the root meaning of his
<>various names. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 341).
<NI>(29) He explained to sages and Bhu1midevi1 some pro-
<>found doctrines about God and the world. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 167).
<NI>(30) He gave permission to Bhi1s2ma to die. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 167).
<NI>(31) Consoled Gan3ga1devi1 who grieved over the death
<>of Bhi1s2ma. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 168).
<NI>(32) He once again revealed the doctrine of the Gi1ta1
<>in the form of discussions between Siddhamahars2is and
<>Kas4yapa. (A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 16).
<NI>(33) After the great war was over he went to Dva1raka1
<>with Subhadra1 and Sa1tyaki with the consent of Yudhis2-
<>t2hira. (A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 57, Verses 54-58).
<NI>37) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a again at Dva1raka1.%} When Kr2s2n2a returned to
<>Dva1raka1, Sage Uttan3ka visited him. The sage was told
<>details about the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas by Kr2s2n2a.
<>He detailed to the sage spiritual principles too and
<>showed him his Vis4varu1pa (Cosmic form). Kr2s2n2a parti-
<>cipated in festival held by the Ya1davas on the Raivata
<>mountain. Afterwards when he went to Dva1raka1 he
<>told his father Vasudeva details about the war. He him-
<>self performed the obsequies of Abhimanyu. (As4vamedha
<>Parva).
<NI>(38) {%Killed Ham3sad2ibhakas.%} See under D2ibhaka.
<NI>(39) {%Kr2s2n2a brought back Pari1ks2it to life.%} Kr2s2n2a again
<>went to Hastina1pura. There Uttara1, wife of Abhimanyu,
<>delivered, but the child was born dead as the arrow
<>of As4vattha1ma1 had hit her womb. Kr2s2n2a brought the
<>dead child back to life on the request of Kunti1. It was
<>this child, who became later famous as Pari1ks2it. (As4va-
<>medha Parva, Chapter 66).
<NI>(40) {%The evening of Kr2s2n2a's life.%}
<NI>(1) {%The curse of Ga1ndha1ri1.%} Most of the heroes and
<>distinguished archers like Duryodhana had been killed
<>in the great war, and Ga1ndha1ri1 overwhelmed with grief
<>and anger at the death of her sons lamented over them [Page428-b+ 65]
<>loudly. She realised that Kr2s2n2a was the cause of all
<>the destruction and cursed him as follows:--
<>“If I have gained any powers by my loyal and devout
<>service to my husband, O! Kr2s2n2a I curse you on the
<>strength of that power. Since you forsook relations like
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas who quarrelled with
<>each other, you also will have to witness the killing of
<>relations. Thirtysix years from today your relations,
<>ministers and sons will be killed, and you too will be
<>killed by a hunter in the forest. Your women-folk also
<>will cry as we women cry now.” (Stri1 Parva, Chapter
<>25).
<NI>The curse of Ga1ndha1ri1 that the Ya1dava dynasty would
<>be annihilated after thirtysix years was fulfilled. In the
<>thirtysixth year another curse also befell the dynasty
<>which contributed further to its annihilation.
<NI>(2) {%Curse of the sages.%} The sages Vis4va1mitra, Kan2va
<>and Na1rada came to Dva1raka1 once. Some Ya1davas
<>brought Sa1mba dressed as a pregnant woman before the
<>sages and asked them derisively what child, whether
<>male or female, would Sa1mba give birth to. Angry at
<>this insult, the sages said that the ‘pregnant woman’
<>would deliver an iron rod, which would become instru-
<>mental for the destruction of the Ya1dava dynasty. Kr2s2n2a
<>who was told about the curse said that it was as it was
<>destined to be. Next day Sa1mba delivered an iron rod.
<>The Ya1davas filed it into powder and threw the
<>powder into the sea. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a enforced prohibition of
<>liquours in Dva1raka1 with the object of avoiding any
<>untoward incidents in Dva1raka1. It was declared that
<>those who produced liquor would be hanged to death
<>along with their families. (Mausala Parva, Chapter 1).
<NI>(3) {%Evil omens.%} Signs of the destruction of the Ya1davas
<>began appearing. Agents of Ka1la visited house after
<>house. Rats multiplied in numbers everywhere in the
<>land, and they began gnawing the nails and hairs of
<>people enjoying sleep. Sheep howled like jackals. Asses
<>were born from cows and cats from mules. Dogs coha-
<>bited with rats. The Cakra1yudha (Discus) given to
<>Kr2s2n2a by Agnideva at the time of Kha1n2d2avada1ha dis-
<>appeared into the sky while the Ya1davas were looking
<>on. Thus symptoms of an all-round destruction were
<>witnessed.
<NI>(4) {%Destruction of the ra1davas.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Balabhadra,
<>Uddhava and others were about to go on a pilgrimage,
<>and the Yadus, the Vr2s2n2is and the Andhakas began
<>manufacturing and drinking liquor. They also began to
<>quarrel with one another. The powder of the iron rod
<>thrown into the sea was washed ashore and it grew up
<>like arrow-like grass. The Ya1davas fought with one
<>another and many were killed. Kr2s2n2a got terribly angry
<>at the death of Sa1tyaki, Pradyumna and others. He
<>plucked a handful of grass and it transformed itself into
<>an iron rod with which he beat to death those around
<>him. Then all the people plucked up the grass which
<>turned into iron rods. They fought amongst themselves
<>with the iron rods and all of them got killed.
<NI>(5) {%Death of Ra1ma and Kr2s2n2a.%} During this period Bala-
<>bhadra went and seated himself under a tree in deep
<>meditation. Kr2s2n2a stood near him. Da1ruka and Babhru
<>also arrived there. Kr2s2n2a deputed Da1ruka to Hastina1-
<>pura to inform Arjuna about the annihilation of the
<>Ya1dava race. Then Kr2s2n2a went to the palace and con-
<>soled the women-folk there. When he told them that
<>Arjuna would come and take care of them, his wives [Page429-a+ 64]
<>shed tears. Kr2s2n2a then took leave of Vasudeva and
<>returned to Balabhadra. Kr2s2n2a saw even at a distance
<>a white serpent coming out of Balabhadra's mouth
<>and moving away to Pa1ta1la through the sea. The ser-
<>pent which was the soul of Balabhadra was duly receiv-
<>ed by the prominent Na1gas in Pa1ta1la. Kr2s2n2a roamed
<>about the forest for some time and then lay down on
<>the ground immersed in Yoga with his feet raised up.
<>An Asura called Jara, who saw Kr2s2n2a's raised feet from
<>a distance mistook the same for a deer and shot it with
<>his arrows. Kr2s2n2a expired at once and rose up in the
<>guise of Vis2n2u to Vaikun2t2ha. (Mausala Parva).
<NI>(6) {%Reason for Kr2s2n2a's foot being hit by arrow.%} Durva1sas
<>once went to Dva1raka1 and enquired who was there to
<>put him up as a guest. Kr2s2n2a invited him to his palace
<>and treated him as a very honoured guest. He began
<>creating trouble there by breaking vessels, eating only
<>very sparsely at times but eating all that he saw at
<>other times. Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 put up with the
<>vagaries of the sage quite patiently. One day the sage
<>expressed a desire to taste pudding, and accordingly
<>Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 cooked it and served it to the sage.
<>After tasting some pudding he asked Kr2s2n2a to smear
<>his whole body with the balance of it and Kr2s2n2a did so
<>except the bottom of his feet. The sage asked him why
<>he did not smear the nether surface of his feet with
<>the pudding to which Kr2s2n2a humbly answered that he
<>did not like doing so. Durva1sas smeared Rukmin2i1's
<>body with what remained of the pudding. He yoked
<>Rukmin2i1 to the chariot and rode off swiftly in it. On
<>the way he whipped Rukmin2i1. Kr2s2n2a ran after the
<>chariot so that he might be of service to the sage.
<>After he had gone some distance the sage jumped out
<>of the chariot and ran through the forest. Ultimately
<>he turned round to Kr2s2n2a and told him as follows:--
<>“Oh! Kr2s2n2a! I am pleased with your service. Let
<>Rukmin2i1 have the first place among your wives. She will
<>not be affected by old age. And, you will never meet
<>with death by being hit at those parts of your body
<>which have been smeared with the pudding.”
<NI>When Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 returned to the palace the
<>vessels which Durva1sas had broken were found to be
<>in a more glittering condition than of old. Their welfare
<>and happiness were also increased. Kr2s2n2a died hit by
<>the arrow of the hunter on the lower surface of his feet
<>as he had not smeared that part of the body with the
<>pudding left over by Durva1sas. (Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 159), (There is another story to the effect that
<>Jara, the hunter, was Ba1li (whom S4ri1 Ra1ma had killed)
<>reborn, and he killed Kr2s2n2a in retaliation for his former
<>death).
<NI>(7) {%After Kr2s2n2a's death.%}
<NI>(i) Arjuna came to Dva1raka1 and cremated Kr2s2n2a.

<>yan2a in the divine sphere. (Svarga1rohan2a Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Verses 24-26).
<NI>(iii) Anointed queens like Rukmin2i1 and Ja1mbavati1
<>and some other wives of Kr2s2n2a entered his funeral
<>pyre and ended their lives. (Mausala Parva, Chapter
<>7, Verses 73 and 74).
<NI>(iv) While Arjuna was leading the remaining wives of
<>Kr2s2n2a away from Dva1raka1 forest-dwellers attacked
<>them on the way. But the women, to escape from their [Page429-b+ 65]
<>clutches, ran off and jumped into the river Sarasvati1
<>and died in its waters. Their souls entered heaven

<>ed. The genealogy of both is given below.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1
<>Atri--Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a--
<>Yaya1ti--Yadu--Sahasrajit--S4atajit--Hehaya--Dharma
<>Kunti--Sada1jit--Dhanaka.
<NI>Dhanaka had four sons called Kr2tavi1rya, Kr2ta1gni, Kr2ta-
<>varman and Kr2taujas, and one of the four was the first
<>Kr2tavarman.
<NI>The dynasty continues again from Kr2tavi1rya--Kr2tavi1rya-
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna--Madhu--Vr2s2n2i--Yudha1jit--
<>S4ini--Satyaka--Sa1tyaki (Yuyudha1na)--Jaya--Kan2i--
<>Anamitra--Pr2s4ni--Citraratha--Vid2u1ratha--S4u1ra--S4ini
<>-Bhoja--Hr2di1ka--Kr2tavarman.
<NI>Hr2di1ka had four sons, viz. Devava1ha, Gada1dhanvan,
<>Kr2tavarman and S4u1ra. And, Su1ra begot of his wife,
<>Ma1ris2a1 ten sons, i.e. Vasu, Devabha1ga, Devas4ravas,
<>A1naka, Sr2n5jaya, Ka1ka1ni1ka, S4ya1maka, Vatsa, Kavu1ka
<>and Vasudeva. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was the son of Vasudeva. The
<>Kr2tavarman referred to below was the brother of Kr2s2-
<>n2a's grand-father.
<NI>2) {%Kr2tavarman and Syamantaka.%} King Satra1jit had in his
<>possession the famous gem called Syamantaka. The
<>King's brother Prasena, went for hunting with this jewel
<>on him. A lion killed Prasena, and Ja1mbava1n killed
<>the lion and got the gem. A scandal was circulated to the
<>effect that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a had stolen the gem. But, Kr2s2n2a
<>got back the gem from Ja1mbava1n and handed it over [Page431-a+ 64]
<>to Satra1jit, who in turn, gave his daughter Satyabha1ma1
<>in marriage to Kr2s2n2a. Though Satra1jit wanted to give
<>the gem--Syamantaka--to Kr2s2n2a as dowry, the latter
<>did not accept it.
<NI>Akru1ra and Kr2tavarman were bosom friends, and they
<>incited another Ya1dava King S4atadhanva1, to grab the
<>Syamantaka. S4atadhanva1 killed Satra1jit and took poss-
<>ession of the gem. Hearing about this murder S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma set out to kill S4atadhanva1,
<>who, in great alarm, started for north after entrusting
<>the gem to Akru1ra and Kr2tavarman. His horse died
<>at Mithila1puri1 and he began running. Balabhadra and
<>Kr2s2n2a ran after him, caught and killed him. But, they
<>did not get the Syamantaka.
<NI>Now Akru1ra and Kr2tavarman began their penance at
<>Ka1s4i1. Seven years passed thus when famine broke out
<>in Dva1raka1. When once upon a time famine stalked
<>Ka1s4i1 the king had brought S4vaphalka, father of Akru1ra,
<>over to Ka1s4i1, and there was no more famine in the
<>country. Therefore, when famine broke out in Dva1raka1
<>the Yadavas thought the presence of S4vaphalka's son,
<>Akru1ra would dispel the famine. Accordingly Akru1ra
<>was recalled to Dva1raka1, and along with him returned
<>Kr2tavarman also. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra decided
<>that Syamantaka should be kept by Akru1ra himself.

<HI>KR2TYA1 (KR2TYAKA1) I. A Ra1ks2asi1 who is born when
<>the black arts as enunciated in the Atharvaveda are
<>practised to annihilate enemies. Kr2tya1 may appear in
<>male form too. Some of the activities of Kr2tya1 are
<>given below.
<NI>(1) {%Carried off Duryodhana.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>living in exile in the forest, Duryodhana and others
<>went in a procession to the forest. Though Duryodhana
<>was taken into captivity in the forest by a Gan-
<>dharva, Arjuna saved him out of fraternal considera-
<>tion for him. Duryodhana returned to Hastina1pura.
<>Now the question was whether half of the kingdom [Page432-b+ 64]
<>should be given to the Pa1n2d2avas or not. S4akuni and
<>others advised Duryodhana to give it, but the latter
<>remained adamant against it. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra decided to
<>end his life and for the purpose spread darbha grass on
<>earth and sat thereon. The Asuras heard about these
<>developments and created a Kr2tya1 by mantras. The
<>Kr2tya1 took Duryodhana to Pa1ta1la where the Asuras
<>advised him against any compromise with the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas. On the other hand they wanted him to intensify
<>his hatred against the Pa1n2d2avas, and they assured
<>him all support. After that Kr2tya1 took Duryodhana
<>back to Hastina1pura. (Vana Parva, Chapter 252).
<NI>(2) {%Kr2tya1 born under the name Madana.%} Devendra once
<>prevented the As4vini1devas from drinking Soma juice.
<NI>(Devas drink a liquid-liqueur extracted from the soma
<>creeper, during yajn5as, and that is called Somapa1na).
<>Aggrieved at the orders of Indra the As4vini1devas
<>wandered about the world in the course of which they
<>approached sage Cyavana of the Bha1rgava family.
<>They restored sight to the blind Cyavana, who, in
<>return, assured them that he would see to it that they
<>got the right of drinking soma juice. Cyavana began
<>a Yajn5a and Indra came for Somapa1na. The sage
<>invited the As4vini1devas also for Somapa1na. Indra
<>prevented them from doing so, and the sage opposed
<>him. Then Indra drew his Vajra1yudha against Cyavana.
<>The sage made Indra's hands paralysed. Further, he
<>raised from the Ya1jn5ic fire a Kr2tya1 which appeared in
<>male form under the name Madana. Sharp molar
<>teeth hundred yojanas long, other teeth each ten yoja-
<>nas long, hands ten thousand yojanas long and as big
<>as mountains, round eyes like the Sun and Moon,
<>mouth spitting fire--such was Madana, the Kr2tya1, a
<>really terrible being. Frightened at the sight of the
<>terrible being Indra permitted the As4vini1devas to drink
<>Soma.
<NI>(3) {%Kr2tya1 against Ambari1s2a.%} Ambari1s2a once began the
<>Eka1das4i1 Vrata and the Devas deputed Durva1sas to
<>obstruct it somehow or other. Durva1sas came to
<>Ambari1s2a, who requested him to return after bath.
<>But, though the vrata was over the sage did not return
<>and Ambari1s2a fed the Devas with the offerings (havis).
<>Immediately after that Durva1sas returned and com-
<>plained that what he was given was the left-overs of
<>the havis, By means of black art he created a Kr2tya1,
<>who charged against Ambari1s2a's throat. Ambari1s2a
<>prayed and the Sudars4ana Cakra of Vis2n2u appeared and
<>killed the Kr2tya1 and drove Durva1sas round the three
<>worlds. At last the sage sought refuge with Ambari1s2a
<>himself and thus saved himself. (Bha1gavata, 9th
<>Skandha).
<NI>(4) {%Kr2tya1 opposed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} While Kr2s2n2a was ruling
<>Dva1raka1, Paun2d2rakava1sudeva was the King of Ka1ru1s2a.
<>Once he sent a messenger to ask Kr2s2n2a to go and bow
<>down before him as he was the real Va1sudeva. Enraged
<>at this insolent demand Kr2s2n2a cut off Paun2d2raka's head
<>with the Sudars4ana Cakra. The dead King's son,
<>Sudaks2in2a, to gather power enough to fight Kr2s2n2a
<>went to Ka1s4i1 and performed penance to please S4iva.
<>S4iva appeared and taught him the method of creating
<>Kr2tya1. Accordingly he created from fire, a Kr2tya1, who
<>dashed against Kr2s2n2a roaring like hell. Kr2s2n2a used the
<>Sudars4ana Cakra, which burnt to death not only the
<>Kr2tya1, but also Sudaks2in2a. [Page433-a+ 65]
<NI>(5) {%Kr2tya1 against Prahla1da.%} To change the nature of
<>Prahla1da, a great devotee of Vis2n2u, his father Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu deputed Asura preceptors. But, severe punish-
<>ments like poisoning, throwing into fire etc. did not
<>succeed in changing the devotee's character. At last,
<>the preceptors raised Kr2tya1 from fire. The S4u1lam,
<>which Kr2tya1 thrust against the throat of Prahla1da was
<>broken into hundreds of pieces. Kr2tya1 then got angry
<>and turned against the preceptors, who had sent her
<>against Prahla1da. The preceptors fell down unconscious
<>on the verge of death. But, Prahla1da touched their
<>bodies and they became alive again. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Part 1, Chapter 18).

<HI>KS2EMADARS4I1. A King of Kosala. There is a story
<>in the Maha1bha1rata stating how the hermit Ka1laka-
<>vr2ks2i1ya saved this King from the trap laid by his
<>favourites. The treasury-keeper spent the money of the
<>King lavishly on himself. The subjects began to
<>consider how to inform the King about this. Finally [Page433-b+ 64]
<>the hermit Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya began to travel throughout
<>the country with a crow kept in a cage. As if the
<>crow was speaking, the hermit began to tell the past,
<>present and future fortunes of the people. The crow
<>became famous and people began to have faith in the
<>crow. Once Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya and the crow reached the
<>palace and under the pretence that the crow was speak-
<>ing, the hermit disclosed all the secret dealings of the
<>treasury-keeper. The servants of the King stealthily
<>put the crow to death that night. When the King
<>knew this he made Ka1lakavr2ks2i1ya the minister and the

<HI>KS2ETRA (S). Sacred spots. In Malaya1lam it means
<>Temples also.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The temples of India are
<>reflections of the outward form or body of man. As
<>the soul lives in the body of man, God dwells in the
<>temples. The stone, rock, marble, metals etc. are equal
<>to the bones of the body of a man.
<NI>2) {%Two types of temples.%} Temples are of two types.
<>One type is the Gra1madevata1 temples. These are
<>temples in which goddess Bhadraka1li1 is consecrated
<>and worshipped for the protection of villages and
<>cities. The second type is of special temples. These are
<>temples specially meant for a particular god or
<>goddess. Thus there are temples for Vis2n2u, S4iva,
<>Gan2apati and so on.
<NI>3) {%Gra1madevata1 temples.%} Worship of Bhadraka1li1 existed
<>in India from very early times. When Mohanjodaro
<>and Harappa were excavated idols of Devi1 (goddess)
<>more than 4000 years old, were obtained from there.
<>During the prevalence of Buddhism in India the
<>goddesses Yaksi1 and Ha1riti1 were worshipped in
<>India. Later when Hinduism was revived these
<>goddesses took their places in it as the goddesses of
<>Hindu Pura1n2as and epics. The Ka1li1 temples of Ujja-
<>yini1 and Calcutta are famous. In the Cidambara
<>temple also the main deity is Ka1li1. The legend is that
<>Paramas4iva defeated Ka1li1 in a dance. In Mysore
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 (Ka1li1) is worshipped as chief goddess or
<>family goddess. Ka1ma1ks2i1 in Ka1n5ci1, Mi1na1ks2i1 in Madura
<>(South India), Mu1ka1mbika1 in North Karn2a1t2aka and
<>so on are the gentle and peaceful forms of Ka1li1.
<NI>4) {%Devas (gods).%} In many of the temples in South
<>India, Muni1s4varan and Karuppan are the gra1ma-
<>devata1s (village gods). In some places Bhairava also is
<>worshipped as gra1madevata1. In certain other places
<>Vi1ran, Irulan, Ka1ret2t2i, Non2d2i and Pan5caruli
<>are worshipped. S4a1sta1 or Ayyappan has a prominent
<>place among the village gods. Importance is attached
<>to S4a1sta1 or Ayyappan mostly in Kerala and Tamil
<>Na1d2u.
<HI>KS2ETRAPA1LA. Ks2etrapa1la is consecrated on the South
<>East corner of the temple, for protecting the villages
<>and cities. This is a large image with three eyes. There
<>are figures which are Sa1ttvika, Ra1jasa and Ta1masa
<>(having the attributes goodness, ostentatiousness and
<>sloth). In some places figures having two or four or
<>eight hands are seen. It is presumed that this deity is
<>a portion of S4iva. It is stated in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>51 that Ks2etrapa1las should be figures having trident in
<>the hand.
<HI>KS2I1RASA1GARA. Sea of Milk. It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 102, that
<>Brahma1 drank too much of Amr2ta and vomited. From
<>the vomit the cow Surabhi came into being. The milk
<>of Surabhi flowed and collected into a sea. This sea is
<>called the milk-sea or Ks2i1rasa1gara. [Page434-b+ 65]
<HI>KS2I1RAVATI1. A holy bath. Those who bathe in this
<>holy bath will obtain the fruits of performing the
<>sacrifice of Va1japeya. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 84).
<HI>KS2I1RIN. A tree in the family of the Uttara Kurus.
<>This tree has six tastes. Milk flows ceaselessly from
<>this tree. It is said that from the fruit of this tree we
<>could get cloth, ornaments etc. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 7).
<HI>KS2ITIKAMPANA. A captain of the army of Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 59).
<HI>KS2UDRAKA. There was a country known as Ks2udraka
<>in Ancient India. Those who inhabited this country
<>were called Ks2udrakas. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 52 that the Ks2udrakas had
<>brought gifts to Dharmaputra. In the battle of Bha1rata
<>Duryodhana protected S4akuni with the help of the
<>Ks2udrakas. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 16).
<>It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 19
<>that the Ks2udrakas attacked Arjuna at the behest of
<>Bhi1s2ma. Many Ks2udrakas were killed when Paras4u-
<>ra1ma exterminated the Ks2atriyas. (M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 70).
<HI>KS2UPA I. A Praja1pati. There is a story about the
<>birth of this Praja1pati in Maha1bha1rata. Once Brahma1
<>wished to perform a sacrifice. But he could not get
<>suitable priest as the performer of the sacrifice. So
<>Brahma1 decided to create a befitting person as R2tvik
<>(the priest who does the rituals of the sacrifice) and
<>he got pregnant in his head. After a thousand years he
<>sneezed and a Praja1pati came out of the head of
<>Brahma1. That Praja1pati was Ks2upa. He made Ks2upa
<>his R2tvik. (Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 122).
<NI>Rudra Bhagava1n made him Praja1pati (the Lord of all
<>subjects).
<HI>KS2UPA II. A King who was the son of Prasandhi,
<>and the grandson of Vaivasvata Manu. He was the
<>father of Iks2va1ku. In Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 8, it is mentioned that Ks2upa stayed in the
<>Palace of Yama after his death. In Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 166 it is stated that this King had receiv-
<>ed a sword directly from Vaivasvata Manu. Ks2upa
<>was not in the habit of eating flesh. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva. Chapter 159, Stanza 67).
<HI>KS2URAKARN2I1. An attendant of Skanda. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 25).
<HI>KUBERA.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1--
<>Pulastya--Vis4ravas--Kubera.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya Praja1pati wedded Ma1nini1 alias Havir-
<>bhu1, daughter of sage Tr2n2abindu, and a son called
<>Vis4ravas was born to them, Vis4ravas married Ilibila1
<>alias Daivavarn2ini1, daughter of Bharadva1ja. Ra1van2a
<>Kumbhakarn2a and Vibhi1s2an2a were the sons of Vis4ravas
<>by another wife. (Refer to the genealogy of Ra1van2a).
<>Vis4ravas was childless for long, and the above mention-
<>ed four sons were the fruits of the boon granted him
<>by Brahma1, whom he pleased by austerities. (For details
<>see under Vis4ravas, Para 1).
<NI>3) {%Kubera's attainment of eminence.%} Once during Kr2ta-
<>yuga the Devas went to Varun2a, and after performing
<>a Yajn5a for Kubera they told him thus: “In future you
<>live in the ocean itself as deva of all rivers, and let the
<>ocean and the rivers obey you. As in the case of the
<>moon you too will experience waxing and waning.”
<>From that day onwards Kubera became the lord of [Page435-a+ 65]
<>oceans, rivers, streams etc. and all of them together
<>gave him immense wealth. S4iva became a particular
<>friend of Kubera. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 47).
<NI>4) {%Kubera in Lan3ka1.%} Afterwards Kubera performed
<>penance for ten thousand years in water with head
<>submerged, to please Brahma1. Yet, Brahma1 did not
<>appear. Then he performed penance standing on one
<>foot in the centre of Pan5ca1gni. Brahma1 appeared and
<>asked him to choose any boon. Kubera requested that
<>he might be made a lokapa1laka (protector of the uni-
<>verse) and the custodian of wealth, and Brahma1 respon-
<>ded by supplying Kubera the treasures S4an3kha nidhi
<>and Padmanidhi and also the Pus2paka Vima1na as
<>vehicle. He was also appointed one of the As2t2adikpa1la-
<>kas. (Indra, Agni, Yama, Nirr2ti, Varun2a, Va1yu,
<>Kubera and I1s4a are the eight protectors of the eight
<>regions). Kubera's city is called Mahodaya.
<NI>Kubera felt really happy and told his father Vis4ravas
<>about his new status and dignity. The father also
<>blessed the son. Kubera requested his father to get a
<>city built for him to live in, and his father asked him to
<>settle down in Lan3ka1 built by Maya on top of the
<>mountain Triku1t2a in the middle of the south sea. From
<>that day onwards Kubera took his abode in Lan3ka1. (It
<>was originally built for Indra).
<NI>5) {%Old history of Lan3ka1.%} Once upon a time when
<>Brahma1 was repeating the Vedas he felt hungry. He was
<>annoyed that at that untimely hour he should have felt
<>hungry, and from his angry face emerged the Ra1ks2asa
<>called Heti. From his hunger emerged the Yaks2a called
<>Praheti. The Ra1ks2asa turned out to be an unrighteous
<>being, and the Yaks2a a righteous person. Heti married
<>Bhaya1, daugher of Ka1la, and a son Vidyutkes4a was born
<>to them, who wedded Sa1lakat2an3ka1, daughter of Sandhya1.
<>To them were born a child, whom they forsook in
<>the valley of mountain Manthara and went their own.
<>way. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 came that way just then, saw
<>the forsaken child and blessed it. At once the child
<>became a youth. S4iva named him Sukes4a, and he
<>married Devavati1, the daughter of a Gandharva called
<>Man2imaya. To them were born three sons called
<>Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1. and Ma1li1. Thanks to the blessings
<>of S4iva all of them became youths as soon as they were
<>born. By means of penances they secured from Brahma1
<>the boon to conquer the three worlds.
<NI>They then returned to their father. They did not relish
<>the advice of their father to lead a righteous life. They
<>went round the three worlds harassing people. Maya
<>built for them the city called Lan3ka1 on the top of the
<>Mountain Triku1t2a.
<NI>There is a story about the origin of Triku1t2a. Once a
<>controversy arose between Va1suki and Va1yubhagava1n
<>as to who was the greater of the two. To prove that he
<>was greater than Va1yu, Va1suki enveloped with his body
<>mountain Maha1meru so that Va1yu (wind) could not
<>enter it, and Va1yu tried to blow off the mountain with
<>the result that a dust storm concealed the whole world
<>from view. The Devas took refuge in Vis2n2u, who paci-
<>fied Va1suki, and he then unwound one coil round the
<>mountain. Va1yu took advantage of the opportunity and
<>swept off one peak of the mountain to the South into
<>the sea, and that peak is Triku1t2a.
<NI>Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1 and Ma1li1 settled down in Lan3ka1, and
<>they married Sundari1, Ketumati1 and Vasudha1, the three
<>daughters of Narmada1, a Gandharva woman. Seven [Page435-b+ 65]
<>sons called Vajramus2t2i, Viru1pa1ks2a, Durmukha, Supta-
<>ghna Yajn5akos4a, Matta and Unmatta and a daughter
<>called Nala1 were born to Ma1lyava1n and Sundari1. Ten
<>sons called Prahasta, Akampa, Vikat2a, Ka1laka1mukha,
<>Dhu1mra1ks2a, Dan2d2a, Supa1rs4va, Sam3hra1da, Prakva1ta
<>and Bha1sakarn2a and four daughters called Veka1, Pus2-
<>potkat2a1, Kaikasi1 and Kumbhi1nasi1 were born to Suma1li1
<>and Ketumati1. Four sons called Anala, Anila, Aha and
<>Sampa1ti (these four were the ministers of Vibhi1s2an2a)
<>were born to Ma1li1 and Vasudha1.
<NI>When the harassments of the Ra1ks2asas became unbear-
<>able the Devas sought protection from S4iva, and Indra
<>detailed to him about the unrighteous actions of Ma1lya-
<>va1n, Suma1li1 and Ma1li1. S4iva directed the Devas to
<>Vis2n2u, who set out, to fight against the Ra1ks2asas.
<>Ma1li1 cut at Garud2a, and Vis2n2u killed him (Ma1li1)
<>with his Sudars4ana Cakra. The other Ra1ks2asas retreated
<>to Lan3ka1. As their presence in Lan3ka1 was dan-
<>gerous to the Devas, Vis2n2u directed the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra to go to Lan3ka1 every day and kill the Ra1ks2asas
<>in groups. The Cakra began its work, and the remaining
<>Ra1ks2asas escaped to Pa1ta1la. Lan3ka1 became thus deserted
<>and Kubera took his abode there. The Yaks2as, born from
<>the hunger of Brahma1 roamed about without a leader
<>and ultimately settled down in Lan3ka1 under the leader-
<>ship of Kubera. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>6) {%Kubera left Lan3ka1.%} The other sons of Vis4ravas like
<>Ra1van2a returned with boons from Brahma1 for the con-
<>quest of the earth, and the first thing Ra1van2a did was to
<>drive away his brother Kubera from Lan3ka1. He also
<>took by force the Pus2paka Vima1na of Kubera, who
<>cursed Ra1van2a thus: “This will never be your vehicle,
<>but will become that of his, who kills you.”
<NI>Kubera, with the Yaks2as, Kinnaras etc. went north and
<>settled on mount Gandhama1dana. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 275).
<NI>7) {%Kubera's sabha1.%} The assembly hall of Kubera is 100
<>yojanas in length and 100 yojanas wide. High walls
<>surround the city. In the centre of the city is a beautiful
<>mansion studded with gems where Kubera sits surrounded
<>by thousands of women. Ma1ruta Deva carrying fragrance
<>from Kalpavr2ks2a worships him. Gandharva and Apsara1
<>women entertain Kubera with music. Mis4rakes4i1, Ram-
<>bha1, Menaka1, Urvas4i1, Citrasena1, S4ucismita1, Ghr2ta1ci1,
<>Pun5jikasthala1, Vis4va1ci1, Sahajanya1, Pramloca1, Varga1,

<>Pus2pa1nana, Pin3galaka, S4on2itoda, Prava1laka, Vr2ks2aba1s2-
<>paniketa, Ci1rava1sas and Nalaku1bara are the chief
<>members in the court of Kubera. S4iva, a good friend
<>of Kubera, very often visits him. Gandharvas and sages
<>like Vis4va1vasu, Ha1ha1, Hu1hu1, Parvata, Tumburu and
<>S4ailu1s2a live in Kubera's assembly. Na1rada told Dharma-
<>putra that the Kuberasabha1 was thus always sweet and
<>pleasant. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 10).
<NI>8) {%Fight between Kubera and Ra1van2a.%} Kubera got secret
<>information that the Devas and the brahmins had decid-
<>ed jointly to complain to Maha1vis2n2u about their
<>unbearable harassment by Ra1van2a. He sent a messen-
<>ger to his brother Ra1van2a warning him to lead a more
<>righteous life. Ra1van2a got so much enraged at the [Page436-a+ 64]
<>advice of his brother that he cut the messenger into
<>pieces and served as food to the Ra1ks2asas.
<NI>Ra1van2a mobilised his army against Kubera and the
<>Devas, and decided first to attack Kubera. At the head
<>of a huge army led by heroes like Mahodara, Prahasta,
<>Ma1ri1ca, S4uka, Sa1ran2a, Vajradam3s2t2ra, Dhu1mra1ks2a,
<>Viru1pa1ks2a, Yu1pa1ks2a, Maha1pa1rs4va, Matta, Unmatta,
<>Vikat2a, Suptaghna, Yajn5a1ntaka, Makara1ks2a, Kumbha-
<>karn2a, Atika1ya and Aks2akuma1ra, Ra1van2a marched to
<>Alaka1puri1 where a fierce battle ensued between Ra1va-
<>n2a's and Kubera's armies. Many Yaks2as were killed
<>by Ra1van2a's army, and the Yaks2a hero Man2icara
<>killed a large number of Ra1ks2asas. As a last resort
<>Ra1van2a thrashed Man2icara on the head with a club
<>and this turned the hair on his head to one side. From
<>that day Man2icara came to be known as Pa1rs4vamauli
<>(head turned to one side). In the fight that followed
<>between Kubera and Ra1van2a the former fell down
<>unconscious. But, the Yaks2as brought two Vima1nas
<>and carried Kubera to the palace. Ra1van2a plundered
<>Kubera's palace and carried off to Lan3ka1 a lot of costly
<>gems and other wealth. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a)
<NI>9) {%Kubera became a Chameleon.%} King Marutta once per-
<>formed a Mahes4vara yajn5a to which were invited
<>Indra, Varun2a, Kubera and Ka1la. While the yajn5a was
<>progressing Ra1van2a came that way with his army.
<>Indra and the others, in great fear, ran away and
<>escaped disguised in various forms, Kubera assuming
<>the form of a chameleon. After resuming his own form
<>Kubera gave the Chameleon the gift to change its
<>colour. It was further blessed that to the onlookers it
<>would seem that there was gold on its cheeks. (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>10) {%Kubera cursed Viru1pa1ks2a.%} Kubera had a yaks2a called
<>Viru1pa1ks2a as Manager, and he was in charge of
<>Kubera's treasures also. Viru1pa1ks2a had employed a
<>gigantic yaks2a to look after the treasures outside the
<>capital. One day a brahmin called Pa1s4upata came in
<>search of treasures to Alaka1puri1. He knew a very
<>peculiar art, viz. he would go about with a lamp
<>lighted with ‘the ghee of men’ (oily substance extracted
<>from human body) and the lamp would tumble down
<>from his hands on earth exactly on spots where trea-
<>sures lay hidden. Pa1s4upata tried to unearth Kubera's
<>treasures by the above means, and Viru1pa1ks2a who got
<>scent of the brahmin's activities got him killed. Since a
<>brahmin (Pa1s4upata) was killed the sin of brahmahatya1
<>affected the Yaks2a community, and angered at this
<>Kubera cursed Viru1pa1ks2a into a man, and he was born
<>on earth as the son of a brahmin. Viru1pa1ks2a's wife
<>complained about this curse to Kubera, who told her
<>that she would be born as a daughter of the maid-
<>servant of the brahmin as whose son her husband was
<>born, and that he (son) would marry her. Kubera,
<>further told her that association with her would redeem
<>Viru1pa1ks2a from the curse and that both of them would
<>return to him. Accordingly she lay as a human child at
<>the gates of a brahmin maid-servant, who took it to her
<>master. The child and the brahmin's son grew up
<>together in his father's house, and in due course they
<>were wedded to each other. They felt so happy as
<>though at a reunion after a long separation. First the
<>brahmin boy and after him his wife expired, and they
<>returned to Alaka1puri1. (Katha1saritsa1gara) [Page436-b+ 64]
<NI>11) {%Kubera and emperor Pr2thu.%} While emperor Pr2thu
<>was ruling the land in the best interests of his subjects,
<>mountains, trees, Devas, Asuras, Saptars2is, Ra1ks2asas etc.
<>came to the earth and sang his praises, and as ordered by
<>the emperor the earth turned itself into a cow and they
<>milked her. It was Kubera who served as calf when
<>the Ra1ks2asas began to milk the cow. (Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 69, Verse 24).
<NI>The Devas crowned Pr2thu as emperor, and, on that
<>occasion imperial symbols were presented to him. The
<>throne was presented by Kubera; the royal umbrella by
<>Varun2a; the crown by Indra and the sceptre by Yama.
<>(Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha Chapter 15, Verses 14 and 15).
<NI>12) {%Kubera cursed Tumburu.%} The Yaks2a called Tumburu
<>once displeased Kubera, who cursed him into a Ra1ks2asa.
<>He was to be redeemed from the curse on his death at
<>the hands of S4ri1 Ra1ma. Tumburu, who was born as
<>Vira1dha, the Ra1ks2asa in Dan2d2aka1ran2ya attacked Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a during their stay in exile in the forest
<>and was killed by them. He was cremated in the forest.
<>He resumed his former form as Tumburu and returned
<>to Kubera's palace. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>Ka1n2d2a, Canto 4).
<NI>13) {%Kubera became Pin3gala1ks2a.%} Kubera once looked with
<>jealousy at Pa1rvati1 seated on the left thigh of S4iva, and
<>therefore, he became blind in one eye. When Pa1rvati1
<>regained her equanimity she turned that eye of Kubera
<>into yellow in colour so that he might always remember
<>the incident. Henceforth Kubera came to be known as
<>Ekapin3gala.
<NI>14) {%Agastya cursed Kubera.%} Kubera also was invited to
<>the chanting of mantras held by the Devas at Kus4a1vati1.
<>Kubera was on his way to Kus4a1vati1 with Man2ima1n
<>when the latter spat on the head of Agastya, who was
<>performing penance on the banks of river Ka1lindi1.
<>Agastya cursed them thus:--“Oh Kubera, your attend-
<>ant Man2ima1n has insulted me. Therefore, he himself and
<>the army will be killed by a man. You will grieve over
<>their death. But, you will be absolved from this curse at
<>the sight of the man, who had killed Man2ima1n and his
<>army.”
<NI>Bhi1masena, who went to mount Gandhama1dana in
<>search of the Saugandhika flower could kill Man2ima1n
<>and his soldiers because of this curse of Agastya. After
<>killing Man2ima1n, Bhi1ma saw Kubera in person, and
<>the latter got absolved from the curse. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 161).
<NI>15) {%Other information about Kubera.%} (i) He comforted
<>the Pa1n2d2avas once during their life in exile in the forest.
<>(Vana Parva, Chapter 161, Verse 41).
<NI>(ii) During the war with Ra1van2a when S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>fainted on the field, it was the water, purified by
<>mantras, which Kubera sent through the Yaks2a,
<>Guhyaka, which brought Ra1ma back to consciousness.
<NI>(Vana Parva, Chapter 289, Verse 9).
<NI>(iii) Kubera once cursed the Yaks2a called Sthu1n2akarn2a.

<>Mucukunda. [Page437-a+ 65]
<NI>(vi) S4ukra once carried off all the wealth of Kubera,
<>who complained to S4iva about it. S4iva, in anger, raised
<>his s4u1la, when S4ukra stood on its top and pressed it
<>down. S4iva threw S4ukra off but he fell into the palms
<>of S4iva who threw him again. S4ukra then entered the
<>stomach of S4iva and roamed about there finding no
<>path to get out. S4iva waited with the s4ula to kill S4ukra
<>the moment he came out of his (S4iva's) stomach. S4ukra
<>came out as S4iva's son, and Pa1rvati1 prevented S4iva from
<>killing S4ukra on the plea that it was not proper to kill
<>one's own son. S4ukra thus escaped and Kubera lost
<>some of his wealth. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 289).
<NI>(vii) On another occasion Kubera entertained sage
<>As2t2a1vakra. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 37).

<>Kucela and Kr2s2n2a to collect fire-wood from the forest,
<>and they had to stay the whole night there as they

<>any monetary help. But, by the time he reached home
<>his old dilapidated house had converted itself into a

<>female child. To worship such a child is Kumari1pu1ja1,
<>and it should be conducted accompanied by sumptuous
<>feasts and presentation of clothes etc. There are no
<>hard and fast rules as to how many Kuma1ri1s should
<>be worshipped and as to the manner and method of
<>the worship. The same Kuma1ri1 may be worshipped
<>during all the days of the Pu1ja1, or every day one more
<>girl may be worshipped like this:--one girl on the first
<>day, two on the second day and so on. Or it may be
<>in the order 4, 6, 8 etc or 4, 8, 12, 16 etc. Even if
<>the daily number be nine it is in order. There is no
<>rule that Kuma1ri1s alone should be worshipped; any one
<>of the navakanyaka1s would do. A girl two years
<>old is called Kuma1ri1, three years old Trimu1rti; four
<>years old Kalya1n2i1; five years old Rohin2i1; six years old
<>Ka1li1; Seven years old Can2d2ika1; eight years old S4a1mb-
<>havi1; nine years old Durga1 and ten years old Subhadra1.
<>These girls are called Navakanyaka1s. But, a child less
<>than two years of age should not be worshipped, because
<>it will not be fully sensitive to taste, smell etc. Also,
<>age alone does not render Kuma1ri1s suitable for worship.
<>They should be absolutely free from ulcers, leprosy,
<>ugliness, squint-eyes, dwarfishness, lameness, bad
<>odour, stigma of low birth etc. For the achievement of
<>special objects a Brahmin child should be worshipped;
<>for victory, a Ks2atriya child and for profit, a Vais4ya
<>or a Su1dra child should be worshipped. The Brahmin
<>may worship brahmin childern; the Ks2atriya, Brahmin
<>and Ks2atriya children; the Vais4ya, Brahmin, Ks2atriya
<>and Vais4ya children; and the S4u1dra, Brahmin,
<>Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra children. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, 3rd Skandha).
<HI>KUMBHA I. One of the three sons of Prahla1da, the
<>other two being Virocana and Nikumbha. (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 19).
<HI>KUMBHA. II. Son of Kumbhakarn2a, whose wife
<>Vajrajva1la1 bore him two sons called Kumbha and
<>Nikumbha. Both of them were very powerful, and
<>Kumbha, in the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war defeated the army
<>of monkeys on various occasions. Many of the ministers
<>of Sugri1va tried to defeat Kumbha. An3gada, son of
<>Ba1li also could not stand up to him. Then Sugri1va
<>fought against Kumbha and flung him into the sea
<>when the water in it rose up to the level of mount
<>Vindhya. Kumbha came ashore from the sea roaring
<>but was fisted to death by Sugri1va. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Canto 76).
<HI>KUMBHAKA I. A warrior of Skanda. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Verse 75).
<HI>KUMBHAKA II. (Nikumbhaka). A very reputed sage.
<>If he visited any place at dusk he left it only after a
<>thousand years. He visited Ka1s4i1 once when King Divo-
<>da1sa was ruling the state after having killed the Ra1ks2asa
<>called Ks2emaka, who had lived like a king there. Kum-
<>bhaka lived in a forest in Ka1s4i1 with his disciples.
<>Prosperity reigned supreme within a radius of three
<>Yojanas from where the sage lived. Neither wild beasts
<>nor famine infested the area.
<NI>Once a fierce famine broke out in Ka1s4i1, and the failure
<>of rain caused great havoc. Finding it impossible to [Page439-b+ 65]
<>feed the cows their keepers went with their live-stock
<>every morning to Kumbhaka's place where summer had
<>not yet even peeped in, and after feeding their cows
<>there, they returned home in the evening. But, one even-
<>ing they led back with them the cows used by the sage for
<>his Pu1ja1s. When the sun set, as usual the sage sat before
<>the sacred fire for Pu1ja1. But, the cow had not come.
<>With his divine vision he found out the reason for the
<>absence of the cow. He cursed that the region where
<>the keepers of the cows lived be turned into a desert,
<>and the kingdom of Ka1s4i1 became a desert place, where-
<>upon king Divoda1sa went to the banks of the Gomati1
<>and founded a new kingdom there. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>Chapter 2).
<HI>KUMBHAKARN2A.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1--
<>Pulastya--Vis4ravas--Kumbhakarn2a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Pulastya, one of the Praja1patis married
<>Havirbhu1 (Ma1nini1) and a son called Vis4ravas was
<>born to them.
<NI>Ra1van2a and Kumbhakarn2a were born to Vis4ravas of
<>Pus2potkat2a1, and Vibhi1s2an2a was born to him of Ra1ka1,
<>and Khara and S4u1rpan2akha1 were born to him of
<>Ma1lini1. The above version is based on verses--1 to 8 in
<>Chapter 275 of the Vana Parva. But, according to
<>Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a, Ra1van2a, Vibhi1s2an2a and Kumbha-
<>karn2a were born to Vis4ravas of his wife called Kaikasi1.
<>According to the Agni Pura1n2a, Pus2potkat2a1 and Kaikas4i
<>were one and the same.
<NI>3) {%Former births of Kumbhakarn2a.%} Ra1van2a and Kumbha-
<>karn2a were originally the two Devas called Jaya and
<>Vijaya. Vis2n2u appointed them as gate-keepers at Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. Once they stopped sages like Sanaka and others
<>at the gates, and the latter cursed Jaya and Vijaya into
<>Ra1ks2asas. When they complained about the curse to
<>Vis2n2u he promised to welcome them back to Vaikun2t2ha
<>after they had lived three births as Ra1ks2asas. Accord-
<>ingly Jaya was born as Hiran2ya1ks2a and Vijaya as
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu, both of them Asuras. Maha1vis2n2u incar-
<>nated himself as a Boar and killed Hiran2ya1ks2a and
<>as Narasim3ha he killed Hiran2yakas4ipu. Hiran2ya1ks2a and
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu were reborn as Ra1van2a and Kumbha-
<>karn2a respectively. Maha1vis2n2u, during his incarnation
<>as S4ri1 Ra1ma killed both Ra1van2a and Kumbhakarn2a.
<>Ra1van2a was reborn as S4is4upa1la and Kumbha-
<>karn2a as Dantavaktra. Both of them were killed by
<>Maha1vis2n2u during his incarnation as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Thus
<>the Deva called Vijaya, on account of the curse of
<>Sanaka and other sages, passed through three lives as
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu, Kumbhakarn2a and Dantavaktra and
<>finally reached Vaikun2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>4) {%Kumbhakarn2a secured boons.%} Kumbhakarn2a spent his
<>childhood with his brothers at the a1s4rama of his father
<>on mount Gandhama1dana. Kubera was at the zenith of
<>his glory at that time, having been crowned king of the
<>Yaks2as, and also having got the Pus2paka Vima1na. The
<>reputation of Kubera kindled jealousy in Kumbhakarn2a
<>and his brothers. They too performed penance in the
<>forest on one foot for a thousand years. But, Brahma1
<>did not appear. They continued the penance without
<>eating any food. Khara and S4u1rpan2akha1 stayed there
<>serving their brothers. Even after the second thousand
<>years Brahma1 did not appear. Then Ra1van2a cut off his
<>ten heads and made offerings of them to Brahma1. Then
<>Brahma1 appeared. Brahma1 restored his heads to Ra1van2a [Page440-a+ 64]
<>and he was granted the boon that he would not be
<>killed by anybody but a man. The Devas shuddered
<>at the gift to Ra1van2a, and feared about the future in
<>case Kumbhakarn2a too got such a boon. At their request
<>Sarasvati1 danced on his tongue at the time of
<>Kumbhakarn2a's request for a boon. Kumbha-
<>karn2a wanted NIRDEVATVAM (Absence of all
<>Devas). But by a slip of the tongue (caused by Saras-
<>vati1) what he asked for was nidra1vatvam (sleep).
<>Brahma1 granted him nidra1vatvam; he said that Kum-
<>bhakarn2a would sleep for six months of the year
<>continuously. Vibhi1s2an2a got the boon that he should re-
<>member righteousness in danger and use the Brahma1stra
<>without any training in its use. The brothers returned
<>home after securing the boons, and, after driving off
<>Kubera, the lord of Lan3ka1, Ra1van2a and his brothers
<>took their abode there. (Vana Parva, Chapter 275 and
<>Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>5) {%Death of Kumbhakarn2a.%} Kumbhakarn2a played a very
<>important part in the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war. Prominent
<>warriors on the side of Ra1ma, like Sugri1va, his minis-
<>ters and Laks2man2a fought with him. But, none of them
<>could kill him. At last, S4ri1 Ra1ma's arrows killed him.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 67).
<NI>Kumbhakarn2a is not to be viewed merely and purely
<>as an evil character. His advice to Ra1van2a on various
<>occasions shows noble traits of his character. When S4ri1
<>Ra1ma with his army of monkeys appeared on the other
<>side of the ocean Ra1van2a held a conference of his
<>brothers, ministers and others at which Kumbhakarn2a
<>spoke as follows:--“You abducted Si1ta1 without consult-
<>ing us, and we would not therefore be responsible for
<>the consequences of that action of yours. But, it is not
<>proper that the younger brother should keep away
<>when danger faces the elder one, and on that principle
<>here I am ready to fight Ra1ma.”
<NI>These weighty words of Kumbhakarn2a throw consi-
<>derable light on the character of Kumbhakarn2a.
<NI>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddhaka1n2d2a, Chapter 12).
<HI>KUMBHAKARN2A1S4RAMA. A holy place. He who

<>An3ga1raparn2a).
<HI>KUMBHI1NASI1 II. A daughter born to Vis4va1vasu of

<>them. One who had killed an animal will be kept in

<>the animal killed by him had on its body. (Devi1

<>Chapter 45, Verse 25).
<HI>KUMUDODARA. A particular region in the S4a1ka
<>island. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 25).
<HI>KUMUDVATI1 I. Wife of King Vimars4ana of Kira1ta-
<>des4a. Kumudvati1 requested him one day, to put a
<>stop to his cruelties against the people. His reply was
<>as follows:--“Oh! dear wife, don't feel sorry. In my
<>past life I was a dog and, starved almost to death. I
<>went to the gates of the S4iva temple at Pampa1pura. It
<>was Caturdas4i1 day, and thousands of people had
<>gathered there, and I stood there looking at the
<>S4ivalin3ga. Then someone cried out, ‘Beat the dog to
<>death,’ and though, in mortal terror, I ran thrice
<>about the temple, people beat me to death. Since,
<>although only by accident, I had run thrice around
<>the temple, I was born as a King in the present life. I
<>cherish the greatest devotion for Lord S4iva; but, as
<>inherent tendencies do not die out so easily I possess
<>certain characteristics of the dog and that is why I
<>commit the present cruelties.”
<NI>On hearing her husband's past history Kumudvati1
<>wanted to know about her past also, and Vimars4ana
<>said thus: “In the past life you were a she-dove. Once
<>you sat on the top of a Pa1rvati1 temple with a piece of
<>flesh in your beak. Then another dove tried to snatch
<>it from you, and with it you flew thrice round the
<>temple. But, the other dove killed you and flew away
<>with the piece of flesh. Since you flew around the
<>Pa1rvati1 temple thrice you are now born as a queen.”
<>Vimars4ana told her this also that in the next birth she
<>would be born as the daughter of King Sr2n5jaya, as the
<>daughter of the King of Kalin3ga in her third rebirth,
<>as the daughter of the King of Magadha in her fourth
<>birth, as the daughter of King Das4a1rn2a in her fifth
<>birth, as the daughter of Yaya1ti in her sixth birth, as
<>the daughter named Vasumati1 of the King of Vidarbha
<>in her seventh birth, and that ultimately she would
<>attain salvation. Vimars4ana in his next birth would
<>likewise be born as the Sindhu King, as the King of
<>Saura1s2t2ra in his third birth, as the King of Ga1ndha1ra
<>in his fourth birth, as King of Avanti1 in his fifth birth,
<>as King A1narta in his sixth birth, as King of the
<>Pa1n2d2yas in his seventh birth, and that ultimately he
<>too would attain salvation. Thus Vimars4ana taught his

<>as they had gone round the temple. (S4iva Pura1n2a,

<HI>KUMUDVATI1 II. Wife of Kus4a, son of S4ri1 Ra1ma.

<>the country was called Kuntala and the people were
<>known as Kuntalas. (Sabha1 Parva, and Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>KUNTI1 (PR2THA1). Wife of King Pa1n2d2u and the mother
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas, Kunti1 is a noble heroine in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Kunti1 was the sister of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's father
<>Vasudeva. Her real name was Pr2tha1. Vasudeva and
<>Pr2tha1 were the children of King S4u1rasena of the Ya1dava
<>dynasty. King Kuntibhoja was the son of S4u1rasena's
<>sister. He had no issues. S4u1rasena had promised to give
<>the daughter first born to him as the adopted daughter
<>of Kuntibhoja, and accordingly his first-born daughter
<>Pr2tha1 was given to Kuntibhoja, and Kunti1 was brought
<>up in his palace. From that day onwards Pr2tha1 came to
<>be known as Kunti1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 111).
<NI>Kunti1, Ma1dri1 and Ga1ndha1ri1 were born from aspects
<>respectively of the three celestial women Siddhi, [Page442-b+ 65]
<>Kr2ti and Mati. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 160).
<NI>2) {%Kunti1 and the mantra.%} To treat brahmins who came
<>to the court of Kuntibhoja with worshipful offerings
<>etc. was the duty of Kunti1. Once sage Durva1sas visited
<>Kuntibhoja, and as he knew that the sage was easily
<>annoyed Kunti1 was specially deputed for his service,
<>and she served him to the utmost. One day, to test
<>Kunti1, he asked her to be ready with his food by the
<>time he took his bath, and he took practically no time
<>to return after bath and sit for meals. By that time
<>Kunti1 had managed to cook his food, which she placed
<>before him in a plate. The food was too hot and steam-
<>ing, and the sage meaningfully looked at the back of
<>Kunti1. Realising the meaning of the look, Kunti1 turned
<>her back to the sage for him to place the plate of food
<>thereon. The sage placed it accordingly on her back
<>and began eating. Though her back was really burning
<>she showed no sign of it. Pleased at her behaviour the
<>sage taught her a mantra and blessed her to the follow-
<>ing effect.
<NI>“Repeating this mantra you invoke whichever Deva you
<>like and thanks to his favour you will get children.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalambaka, Taran3ga 2 and
<>Bha1rata (Malaya1lam) Chapter 111).
<NI>3) {%Kunti1 tested the mantra.%} After the departure of
<>Durva1sas from the palace, Kunti1 developed an irresisti-
<>ble desire to test the efficacy of the mantra. and one
<>day she invoked Sun-god with the mantra. Thereupon
<>Su1rya approached her in the guise of a brahmin youth.
<>Kunti1 got alarmed. Owing to disinclination to become
<>an unmarried mother Kunti1 could not make up her mind
<>to welcome the brahmin youth. But, Su1rya deva argued
<>that his coming could not be in vain, and Kunti1 had
<>to yield. She requested Su1rya for a son adorned with
<>helmet, ear-rings etc. (Vana Parva Chapter 207 Verse
<>17).
<NI>Su1rya assured Kunti1 that even though a child was born
<>to her from him, that will not affect her virginity and
<>departed. Kunti1 delivered a son in due course of time
<>in secret. She locked up the child in a box and floated
<>it in the Yamuna1. An old charioteer called Adhiratha
<>picked up the child from the river and brought it up as
<>though it were his own son. That boy grew up to
<>become the famous Karn2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 112).
<NI>4) {%Kunti1's wedding.%} In due course Kuntibhoja cele-
<>brated Kunti1's Svayam3vara and she chose King Pa1n2d2u
<>of the lunar dynasty as her husband, and Pa1n2d2u took
<>her to Has2tina1pura in all pomp and glory. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 112).
<NI>5) {%Kunti1's wedded life.%} Pa1n2d2u married another wife also
<>called Ma1dri1, and all the three of them led a very
<>happy life. During one of those days Pa1n2d2u went
<>a hunting in the forest and arrowed to death sage Kin-
<>dama, who was making love with his wife in the forest,
<>both of them having assumed the forms of deer. The
<>sage cursed Pa1n2d2u with death the moment he touched
<>his wives, and grief-stricken at the curse he told his
<>wives about it and decided to take to Sannya1sa. But,
<>the wives told him that they would commit suicide in
<>case he took to Sannya1sa. Ultimately Pa1n2d2u went to
<>S4atas4r2n3ga with his wives, and there he began the per-
<>formance of penances.
<NI>After some time Pa1n2d2u asked his wives to become
<>mothers by some noble persons. But, Kunti1 and Ma1dri1
<>did not agree to it. Then Kunti1 told Pa1n2d2u about the [Page443-a+ 63]
<>boon she had got from Durva1sas, and with his per-
<>mission she bore three sons called Dharmaputra, Bhi1ma
<>and Arjuna respectively from the three Devas, Dharma,
<>Va1yu and Indra. As it had been ordained that the
<>fourth and fifth children would bring sorrows and pain
<>to the parents Kunti1 satisfied herself with three child-
<>ren (A1di Parva, Chapter 122, Verses 77, 78).
<NI>But, as Pa1n2d2u desired that Ma1dri1 also should have
<>children by Kunti's mantra she used the remaining
<>mantra and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva from the
<>As4vini1devas were born to her.
<NI>6) {%Kunti1 widowed.%} During a winter when the forest
<>was fragrant with flowers, Pa1n2d2u forgot all about the
<>Sage's curse and indulged in sexual joys with Ma1dri1, and
<>immediately he expired. Kunti1 and Ma1dri1 competed
<>with each other to end their life in the funeral pyre of
<>their husband. But, as the sages and other relations
<>insisted that one of them should live to bring up the
<>children, Ma1dri1 alone ended her life, and Kunti1 returned
<>to Hastina1pura with the five children. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 125).
<NI>7) {%Kunti1 at Hastina1pura.%} At Hastina1pura differences
<>cropped up between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas.
<>Kunti1 and the five Pa1n2d2avas removed themselves to
<>the ‘Lac palace’ built at Va1ran2a1vata. When the palace
<>was gutted by fire Kunti1 and her sons escaped through
<>a secret tunnel to the forest, and Bhi1ma carried the
<>worn out Kunti1 on his shoulders. In the forest the
<>Ra1ks2asa woman Hid2imbi1, requested Kunti1 to permit
<>Bhi1ma to become her husband, and Kunti1 advised
<>Bhi1ma to beget a child by Hid2imbi1, and thus was born
<>Ghat2otkaca. At the city named Ekacakra1, Vya1sa consoled
<>Kunti1. There the brahmins complained to Kunti1 about
<>the depredations of Baka1sura. Kunti1 got Baka killed by
<>Bhi1ma and asked the brahmins to keep the matter secret.
<>On the advice of a brahmin who came there accidental-
<>ly Kunti1 and others visited the Pa1n5ca1la kingdom, and
<>there Arjuna, having defeated all the Kings present
<>at Pa1n5ca1li1's Svayam3vara wedded her. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>who returned with Pa1n5ca1li1 at dusk time were asked by
<>Kunti1 to enjoy that day's bhiks2a1 (Alms received) to-
<>gether among themselves. Accordingly Pa1n5ca1li1 became
<>the wife of all the five Pa1n2d2avas. Vidura, at the court
<>of the Pa1n5ca1la King saluted Kunti1 and presented to her
<>various varieties of gems. Kunti1 and Vidura talked
<>about the painful incidents of the past, and Vidura
<>escorted the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hastina1pura.
<NI>Arjuna led a solitary life in the forest for one year, and
<>then returned to Hastina1pura with Subhadra1 whom he
<>had married meanwhile. Kunti1 received Subhadra1
<>heartily. In the game of dice with Duryodhana, Dharma-
<>putra was defeated, and the Pa1n2d2avas again started
<>for their life in the forest. During this period Kunti1
<>lived in Vidura's house. Meanwhile S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a one day
<>visited Kunti1, and she told Kr2s2n2a about the fate of her
<>sons with tears in her eyes. Duryodhana refused to give
<>half of the kingdom to the Pa1n2d2avas, who returned
<>after twelve years' life in exile in the forest and one
<>year's life incognito. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a prompted the Pa1n2d2avas
<>to war with the Kauravas, and both the parties began
<>preparations for war. (A1di Parva, from Chapter 135 to
<>Sabha1 and Vana Parvans and Udyoga Parva, upto
<>Chapter 137). [Page443-b+ 65]
<NI>8). {%Kunti1 before Karn2a.%} War clouds grew thick and
<>fast, and Kunti1 at Vidura's house got restless. Her
<>heart trembled at the disasters of war as described by
<>Vidura. She went alone to the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>where just then Karn2a was engaged in Japa with his
<>hands raised and face turned to the east. Kunti1 waited
<>for some time after which they began to talk. With
<>tears in her eyes Kunti1 told Karn2a that he was her
<>son and implored him to return to the Pa1n2d2ava side
<>to which Karn2a replied as follows: “Oh! noble lady,
<>that is quite impossible. I have vowed to kill Arjuna.
<>I will not kill the other four Pa1n2d2avas. You shall
<>always have five sons alive. If Arjuna were to be no
<>more I would be there for you in his stead.”
<NI>Kunti1 shuddered at those terrible words of Karn2a,
<>and thus did both of them part with each other.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapters 145 and 146).
<NI>9) {%Last days of Kunti1.%} The great war ended. Thou-
<>sands of warriors on the Kaurava side like the mighty
<>Karn2a were no more. On the Pa1n2d2ava side also many
<>were killed. Though the Pa1n2d2avas won the war their
<>hearts no more enjoyed peace or happiness. Kunti1
<>suffered as though caught in a wild fire. She asked
<>the Pa1n2d2avas to perform the obsequies for Karn2a also.
<>When she let out the secret that Karn2a was her first-
<>born child Dharmaputra burst into tears. Kunti1
<>consoled Subhadra1 and Uttara1 who were lamenting
<>over the death of Abhimanyu. She requested S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a to cremate the dead son of Uttara1.
<NI>Then Kunti1 went to Ga1ndha1ri1, who stood there bathed
<>in tears. Grief-stricken, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1
<>started for the forest. Holding Ga1ndha1ri1's hand in hers
<>Kunti1 led the way. The Pa1n2d2avas prevented their
<>mother from going, but she did not yield. She advised
<>Dharmaputra to have a special eye on Sahadeva, not
<>to forget Karn2a's name and not to show any dis-
<>pleasure towards Bhi1ma and Pa1n5ca1li1. But, the
<>Pa1n2d2avas wanted to follow their beloved mother into
<>the forest. Pa1n5ca1li1 and Subhadra1 stationed themselves
<>behind Kunti1, who shed copious tears at the sight.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1, who also felt deeply
<>pained at the sight tried their best to dissuade Kunti1
<>from following them to the forest. But, Kunti1 consoled
<>her sons and daughters-in-law by means of sympathetic
<>words and followed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 to the
<>banks of the Gan3ga1, where all of them lived together.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas felt acutely the absence of their mother
<>at home. They went to the forest and paid their res-
<>pects to Kunti1 on the banks of the Gan3ga1. Kunti1
<>embraced Sahadeva with tears in her eyes. Though
<>Yudhis2t2hira and Sahadeva wanted to stay with Kunti1
<>in her service she did not allow that. Kunti1, Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 performed penance in the forest
<>near the Gan3ga1, taking food only once in a month.
<>The three of them died there in a wild fire. (A1s4rama-
<>va1sika Parva, Chapter 37, Verse 31). Their relations
<>inmersed their bones in the Gan3ga1 and performed the
<>necessary obsequies. (Stri1, S4a1nti, A1s4ramava1sika and
<>A1s4vamedhika Parvans).
<NI>10) {%Kunti1 in Devaloka.%} Kunti1, Ma1dri1 and Pa1n2d2u

<>effulgent as burning fire. The famous Sage Vis4va1mitra
<>was born in Kus4a's dynasty. (For genealogy etc see
<>under Vis4va1mitra).
<HI>KUS4A II. One of the two sons of S4ri1 Ra1ma, the other,
<>being Lava.
<NI>1). {%Birth.%} To Si1ta1 forsaken by Ra1ma a son called Lava
<>was born while she was living at the a1s4rama of Va1lmi1ki.
<>One day Si1ta1 took Lava to the stream to bathe him,
<>and Va1lmi1ki, who did not know about it was upset not
<>to see the child in the a1s4rama. He feared that it might
<>have been eaten up by some animal, and fearing that
<>Si1ta1 might die when she missed the child he created a
<>child with Kus4a grass and laid it where Lava was lying
<>before. When Si1ta1 returned to the a1s4rama with Lava
<>after their bath Va1lmi1ki explained the whole situation
<>to Si1ta1. Since the second child was created with Kus4a
<>grass he was called Kus4a, and he was made the second
<>son of Si1ta1 (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a and Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Alan3ka1ravati1lambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<NI>2) {%Kus4a went to Ayodhya1.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma decided to conduct
<>an As4vamedha yajn5a. It was ordained that the emperor,
<>who conducted a yajn5a should have his wife. As Si1ta1
<>had been abandoned, Ra1ma had no wife for the pur-
<>poses of the yajn5a. It was laid down that in the absence
<>of the wife a statue of hers may be made with pala1s4a
<>wood. But, Vasis2t2ha decreed that a statue of Si1ta1
<>might be made with gold. The yajn5a was to be held
<>in the Naimis2a forest. During the triumphal tour of
<>S4atrughna with the ya1jn5ika horse he reached the banks
<>of the river Tamasa1 near the a1s4rama of Va1lmi1ki where [Page446-a+ 65]
<>Lava and Kus4a captured the horse. S4atrughna could
<>not defeat Lava and Kus4a, and they routed the addi-
<>tional force also which arrived under the leadership of
<>Laks2man2a to help S4atrughna. Then Va1lmi1ki intervened
<>and the horse was returned to S4atrughna. Afterwards,
<>Va1lmi1ki, Si1ta1 and Lavakus4as also attended S4ri1 Ra1ma's
<>yajn5a where Lava and Kus4a recited the poem Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a composed by Va1lmi1ki. Ra1ma recognised the boys
<>and they were made to live in Ayodhya1. Thus did
<>Kus4a visit Ayodhya1.
<NI>The Katha1saritsa1gara tells the following story about
<>Kus4a's visit to Ayodhya1.
<NI>Va1lmi1ki duly performed the thread-wearing ceremony
<>of Lava and Kus4a and taught them, even in their very
<>childhood, all arts and sciences including the secrets
<>about divine arrows. The boys one day killed a deer in
<>the a1s4rama and worshipped with its flesh the lin3ga, which
<>Va1lmi1ki used to worship daily, and as a result of that
<>the sage became ill. Si1ta1devi1 requested for penance for
<>the action of her children, and Va1lmi1ki said that Lava
<>should bring golden lotus flowers from Vais4ravan2a's
<>pond and flowers of Kalpakavr2ks2a from his garden, and
<>that Lava and Kus4a together should worship the
<>S4ivalin3ga with those flowers. Lava then went to mount
<>Kaila1sa and after killing many yaks2as collected the
<>flowers. On his way back he rested for some time at the
<>foot of a tree. Just then Laks2man2a, who was on the
<>look-out for a human being for the naramedha (human
<>sacrifice) of S4ri1 Ra1ma, also reached the spot. He
<>decided to take Lava captive with him, and they fought
<>with each other for some time. At last Lakm2an2a
<>took Lava captive by using mohana1stra (arrow which
<>makes the opponent unconscious) and took him to
<>Ayodhya1. Si1ta1 was pained that Lava had not returned
<>yet, and Va1lmi1ki with his divine vision understood the
<>reason for his absence. He deputed Kus4a to Ayodhya1
<>to bring back with him Lava somehow or other. When
<>Kus4a reached Ayodhya1, S4ri1 Ra1ma was conducting the
<>As4vamedha yajn5a, and Kus4a, successfully confronting a
<>number of people, got into the yajn5a ground. In the
<>combat that ensued between Kus4a and Laks2man2a the
<>latter was defeated, as he could not defeat Kus4a due to
<>the greatness of Va1lmi1ki. When S4ri1 Ra1ma asked
<>Kus4a who he was he replied that he was the brother
<>of Lava and that he had heard from his mother Si1ta1
<>that both of them were the sons of S4ri1 Ra1ma. Ra1ma
<>was overjoyed to hear that and he covered the boys
<>with kisses. Si1ta1 also was brought down from the a1s4rama
<>of Va1lmi1ki, and all of them lived very happily. (Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara, Alam3ka1ravati1lambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<NI>3). {%Kus4a's reign.%} Following the demise of Laks2man2a S4ri1
<>Ra1ma divided the country between Kus4a and Lava. A
<>city called Kus4a1vati1 was built in the Kosala Kingdom
<>and Kus4a was crowned King thereof. Thirtytwo out
<>of the sixtyfour aks2auhin2i1s of the kings of the solar
<>dynasty, four out of the eight ministers and half of the
<>movable property were allotted to Kus4a. Lava was
<>crowned king of north Kosala where a city called
<>S4ara1vati1 was built for him, and the other half of the
<>army, ministers etc. became his share. While Kus4a and
<>Lava were ruling the country thus, S4ri1 Ra1ma immolated
<>himself in the depths of the river Sarayu1 (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4). {%Kus4a's successors.%} Descended from S4ri1 Ra1ma thus:

<>King Sa1lva. The miserly king did not give him any-
<>thing. Thereafter he began worshipping Bhagavati1
<>with the object of making some money. While medita-
<>ting upon Bhagavati1 a girl emerged out of his mouth.
<>She was named Devavati1. When she came of age an
<>asura called S4ambhu desired to marry her; but Kus4a-
<>dhvaja did not agree to the proposal. Enraged at the
<>refusal S4ambhu killed Kus4adhvaja while the latter was
<>asleep one night. But Devavati1 cursed and reduced
<>the asura into ashes. Then she took herself to penance
<>to secure Maha1vis2n2u as her husband when Ra1van2a
<>happened to come there, and he tried to make her his
<>wife. But, she repelled all his attempts at which he
<>caught hold of her by the hair. She escaped by cutting
<>her hair. She then immolated herself in burning fire.

<>S4iva in a cradle throughout day and night, in the next
<>birth he was born as King Kus4adhvaja. One day the
<>King abducted the daughter of the Sage Agnives4a when

<>the curse that he would regain his human form on the
<>day on which he helped Indradyumna.

<>57).
<NI>This statement is not quite correct. Certain other

<>and brother of Kus4a1mba. (See under Kus4ana1bha).
<HI>KUS4ANA1BHA. A son born to Kus4a of Vaidarbhi1. (For

<>they were cured of their hunch at the touch of Brahma-
<>datta and became their previous beautiful selves.
<NI>Kus4ana1bha conducted the yajn5a called Putraka1mes2t2i,
<>and Kus4a, who was so pleased by the yajn5a blessed him
<>to have a son called Ga1dhi. Vis4va1mitra was the son

<>--Vivasva1n--Vaivasvata Manu--S4arya1ti (S4ayya1ti)--
<>A1narta--Revata. Certain Pura1n2as state that it was
<>A1narta, who first built forts at Kus4asthali1. It would not
<>be incorrect to say that A1narta built forts in this city
<>first founded by his son Revata. The city was sunk in
<>the sea after a few years. Afterwards the region re-
<>mained as a forest for long years. It was later on that
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a built Dva1raka1 there. Following Kr2s2n2a's
<>death the Ya1dava dynasty got annihilated and the
<>region was again swallowed by the ocean. Dva1raka1 is

<>1) {%Short history.%} Since details about Laks2man2a are
<>included in the story under ‘Ra1ma’ only a short
<>description is given below:
<NI>Das4aratha, King of Ayodhya1 had three wives,
<>Kausalya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1. To obtain children
<>Das4aratha performed a sacrifice named Putraka1mes2t2i
<>requesting the great sage R2s2yas4r2n3ga to officiate at the
<>ceremony. At the close of the ceremony a divine
<>person rose up from the sacrificial fire with a pot of
<>pudding and all the three wives became pregnant by
<>eating the same. Kausalya1 gave birth to S4ri1 Ra1ma,
<>Kaikeyi1 to Bharata and Sumitra1 to Laks2man2a and
<>S4atrughna. Laks2man2a was an incarnation of Ananta
<>and so Ra1ma and Laks2man2a had more attachment to
<>each other.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra once took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to the
<>forests to give protection to the sages against the
<>demons who gave them trouble. In the course of that
<>Vis4va1mitra took them to the Svayam3vara held at the
<>court of Janaka and S4ri1 Ra1ma married Si1ta1 and
<>Laks2man2a married U1rmila1. [Page449-a+ 65]
<>When the coronation of S4ri1 Ra1ma was about to take
<>place, Kaikeyi1 demanded of Das4aratha, on the strength
<>of the two boons granted to her on a previous occasion,
<>to send S4ri1 Ra1ma to the forests for fourteen years and
<>crown Bharata her son as King. Das4aratha was
<>compelled to accede to her request and so S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>went to the forests. Si1ta1 and Laks2man2a accompanied
<>him. Laks2man2a during the fourteen years of their
<>exile followed his brother Ra1ma like a shadow.
<>Laks2man2a cut off the breasts and nose of S4u1rpan2akha1,
<>the demoness who made amorous overtures to them.
<>Laks2man2a acted promptly and bravely when the
<>notorious trio, Khara, Du1s2an2a and Tris4iras attacked
<>them and he was responsible for the slaughter of the
<>three. Ra1van2a, coming to know of that, carried away
<>Si1ta1 to Lan3ka1.
<NI>Grief-stricken, Ra1ma and Laks2man2a roamed about in
<>the forests searching for Si1ta1. At last they came to
<>Sugri1va with whom they made an alliance. Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a got back for Sugri1va his kingdom of
<>Kis2kindha1 and Sugri1va in return helped Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a to fight Ra1van2a. Accompanied by an army
<>led by Sugri1va Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went to Lan3ka1
<>and defeating Ra1van2a took back Si1ta1 to Ayodhya1. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma was crowned King and Laks2man2a helped his
<>brother in his duties. When there arose a scandal
<>about Si1ta1 from the people, S4ri1 Ra1ma asked Laks2man2a
<>to take Si1ta1 away to the forest and leave her there. In
<>the As4vamedha conducted by S4ri1 Ra1ma, Laks2man2a
<>led the sacrificial horse and the horse was blocked and
<>captured by Lava and Kus4a and Laks2man2a fought
<>against them.
<NI>When the purpose of the incarnation of Ra1ma was
<>over, god of Death in the garb of a sage approached
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma for a private talk. Ra1ma and the sage were
<>closeted in a room and Laks2man2a was asked to keep
<>watch over the door with instructions not to allow
<>anybody inside. After some time sage Durva1sas
<>came there and Laks2man2a entered the room to give
<>his brother the information of his arrival. Ra1ma was
<>angry and abandoned Laks2man2a and, feeling repen-
<>tant later, S4ri1 Ra1ma jumped into the river and drowned
<>himself before a huge crowd of weeping subjects.
<>Laks2man2a immediately ended his life by drowning
<>himself at the same place where his brother did so.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Laks2man2a was born on the day of A1s4les2a1
<>in the lagna of Karkat2aka. (S4loka 15, Chapter 18,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>LAKS2MAN2A II. A very brave son of Duryodhana. He
<>was a great archer. The Maha1bha1rata gives the
<>following information about him.
<NI>(i) In the great battle Abhimanyu defeated this
<>Laks2man2a. (S4loka 32, Chapter 73, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<NI>(ii) Laks2man2a fought against Ks2atradeva. (S4loka 49,
<>Chapter 14, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(iii) Abhimanyu killed him in the battle-field. (S4loka
<>17, Chapter 46, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(iv) After the great war when once, at the request of
<>Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1, Vya1sa by his yogic powers
<>arrayed the dead warriors for Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1 to
<>see, this Laks2man2a was also among them. (S4loka 11,
<>Chapter 32, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<HI>LAKS2MAN2A1. One of the queens of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>(Chapter 33, Sabha1 Parva, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha).
<HI>LAKS2MI1 I. Consort of Maha1vis2n2u. [Page449-b+ 65]
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Devi1 originated from the left side of
<>Parama1tma1 (Supreme Being). The beautiful Devi1 by
<>a command from the Supreme Being divided herself
<>into two enchanting damsels both equal in figure,
<>splendour, age, majesty, adornment and love. One of
<>these was Laks2mi1devi1 and the other Ra1dha1devi1. That
<>born of the left was Rama1 and that of the right, Ra1dha1.
<>Ra1dha1 wedded herself to the two-handed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>and Laks2mi1 also wanted the same person and so Bhaga-
<>va1n himself became two, S4ri Kr2s2n2a from the left side
<>as a two-handed person and as four-handed
<>Vis2n2u from the right side. (9th Skandha. Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) {%Different incarnations of Laks2mi1.%} Laks2mi1 had many
<>incarnations and she had been on earth in different
<>forms at different times. They are given below:
<NI>(i) {%Birth from the ocean of milk.%} Once the Devas
<>became aged and afflicted with rugosity and
<>grey hairs by a curse of Durva1sas. Indra lost his
<>majesty and was ousted from Svarga. Svargalaks2mi1
<>deserted Devaloka and went to Vaikun2t2ha and merged
<>with Maha1laks2mi1.
<NI>The Devas were greatly aggrieved on account of this
<>plight of theirs and they went to Satyaloka and
<>appealed to Brahma1 to find a solution to their difficult-
<>ies. Brahma1 was helpless in the matter and so they
<>all together went to Vaikun2t2ha and represented their
<>grievances before Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u smiled and told
<>Maha1laks2mi1 thus: “You go and be born as Ks2i1ra-
<>sa1garakanyaka1 using a part of your inherent power
<>and do give relief to the Devas.” Accordingly when
<>the Devas conducted the churning of the ocean of milk
<>(Ks2i1ra1bdhimathana) Maha1laks2mi1, the goddess of
<>beauty, wealth and prosperity arose from the ocean as
<>Ks2i1rasa1garakanyaka1 (Daughter of the ocean of milk)
<>and blessed the Devas and put a Vanama1la1 (garland
<>of wild flowers) on Maha1vis2n2u. The Devas got back
<>all their lost wealth and prosperity and they, on going
<>to Devaloka, worshipped Laks2mi1devi1 properly. (9th
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>(ii) Maha1laks2mi1 was born as a mare. (See under
<>Ekavi1ra, Para 2).
<NI>(iii) Maha1laks2mi1 was born as the Tulasi1 plant (Holy
<>Basil. (See under Tulasi1.)
<NI>(iv) Maha1laks2mi1 was born as Si1ta1 and Vedavati1. (See
<>under Si1ta1).
<NI>(v) {%Other births:%} Maha1laks2mi1 was born as a daughter
<>to the sage Bhr2gu of Khya1ti. When Maha1vis2n2u
<>incarnated as Su1rya, Laks2mi1 rose up from the lotus.
<>When Vis2n2u became Paras4ura1ma, Laks2mi1 became
<>the earth. When Maha1vis2n2u incarnated as S4ri1 Ra1ma,
<>Laks2mi1 became Si1ta1 and when Vis2n2u was born as Kr2s2n2a
<>Laks2mi1 became Ra1dha1. Thus whenever and wherever
<>Maha1vis2n2u changed his form, Maha1laks2mi1 also chang-
<>ed hers to form part of the changed life. (Chapter 9,
<>Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>3) {%Maha1laks2mi1 cursed Vis2n2u.%} Once Maha1laks2mi1 cursed
<>Maha1vis2n2u, her husband, that his head would drop off
<>from his body. (See under Cital).
<NI>4) {%Two forms of Laks2mi1.%} Maha1laks2mi1 has two forms,
<>Vis2n2u-priya1 Laks2mi1 and Ra1jyalaks2mi1. The former is the
<>embodiment of chastity and virtuousness. The latter
<>goes about courting Kings. Ra1jyalaks2mi1 is fickle and
<>unsteady. This Laks2mi1 enters all places where virtue
<>and charity are found and as soon as these two vanish [Page450-a+ 62]
<>from any place Ra1jyalaks2mi1 will also vanish from that
<>place.
<NI>5) {%Laks2mi1 in cow-dung.%} The people of Bha1rata consider
<>cow dung as very sacred and there is a story in the 82nd
<>Chapter of Anus4a1sana Parva as to how cow-dung be-
<>came so sacred;
<NI>Once a herd of cows was grazing in a large grassy ground
<>when Laks2mi1 happened to pass that way. Maha1laks2mi1
<>was pleased at the cows and bade them ask for any boon
<>they wanted. The cows were prosperity incarnate and
<>contented and they rejected the offer of Laks2mi1 and
<>when pressed again by her, said that they would like to
<>have prosperity deposited in their dung also. Maha1-
<>laks2mi1 did so and so even today it is believed that the
<>cowdung is embedded with prosperity.
<NI>6). {%Other details:%}
<NI>(i) Laks2mi1 stays in the court of Kubera. (S4loka 19,
<>Chapter 10, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) Maha1laks2mi1 is installed in temples as an idol carrying
<>a lotus in her right hand and a Bilva fruit in her left
<>hand. (Chapter 50, Agni Pura1n2a).
<NI>(iii) Laks2mi1devi1 stays in the court of Brahma1 also.
<>(S4loka 41, Chapter 11, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>LAKS2MI1 II. A daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. She was
<>married to Dharmadeva. (S4loka 14, Chapter 66, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>LAKS2MI1DA1SA. A Sanskrit poet who was the author
<>of S4ukasandes4a.
<NI>1). {%Birth.%} He was born in the former state of Cochin in
<>Karin3ga1mpilly Mana. This Mana (house) was near the
<>temple of Tr2ppu1taman3gala in Vella1rappilly in Cochin
<>(Kan2ayannu1r taluk). The Karin3ga1mpilly Mana was
<>bearing the position of Taliya1tiri in the village of Ira1n2ik-
<>kula. It is over two hundred years since that Mana
<>became extinct. (The houses of Namboothiri brahmins
<>are called Manas).
<NI>2) It is believed that the famous ‘S4ukasandes4a’ was
<>written in 112 M.E. There is one set of historians
<>who hold that it was written in 666 A.D. But the fam-
<>ous scholar and poet Ullu1r states with authority that
<>it was written in the 10th or 11th century A.D.
<NI>3) {%Stories about this poet.%} As usual there are legends
<>regarding this poet also. That the poet was a very
<>dull boy in his childhood and that he became bright
<>and brilliant by the blessings of his guru is one legend.
<>After writing his S4ukasandes4a the poet went on a
<>pilgrimage in South India. One night he came to a
<>brahmin's house but was not given any food or a place
<>to sleep. He slept in an open veranda on the outside.
<>He was lying awake when he heard his ‘S4ukasandes4a’
<>being read inside by a few people. At a stage they were
<>not able to follow the import of a verse when Laks2mi1-
<>da1sa shouted the meaning from outside. A door
<>opened and a voice enquired in Tamil “Are you
<>Karin3ga1mpilly?” When he said yes they were extremely
<>happy and took him inside and treated him with
<>respect.
<NI>4) {%Works.%} No major work other then S4ukasandes4a has
<>been found. Two small poems are available.
<NI>S4ukasandes4a has been written on the model of the
<>famous Meghasandes4a of Ka1lida1sa. Many commentaries
<>on this have come to light; of these the one written by [Page450-b+ 64]
<>Ma1navedan Ra1ja of Kozhikode Palace named Vila1sini1
<>is the best. Other commentaries named Varavarn2ini1,
<>Cinta1tilaka and Vya1kr2ti are also worth mentioning.
<HI>LA1LA1BHAKS2AM. A hell. (See under Ka1la I).
<HI>LALA1MA. A division among horses. The white patch on
<>the forehead of a horse is also called Lala1ma and so
<>horses with lala1ma are called Lala1mas. (S4loka 13, Chap-
<>ter 13, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>LALA1T2A1KS2A. A country of ancient India. The King of
<>this country was present at the yajn5a of Yudhis2t2hira with
<>very many valuable presents. (S4loka 17, Chapter 51,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>LALITA1. See under PUND2ARI1KAMUKHA.
<HI>LALITA. A Gandharva. This Gandharva was born by
<>a curse and by observing a vrata called Ka1mada1 Eka1das4i1
<>he obtained relief from the curse and became Gandharva
<>again. (Uttara Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>LALITAKA. An ancient holy place of Bha1rata. If one
<>bathes in a sacred pond there, one will be free from sins.
<>(S4loka 34, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<HI>LALITTHA. A country of ancient Bha1rata. The people
<>of the place were called Lalitthas. They fought on the
<>side of the Kauravas in the great battle. Lalitthas boast-
<>ed that they would kill Arjuna in the big battle. The
<>King of the Lalitthas attacked Abhimanyu. Arjuna
<>killed them all in the battle. (S4loka 47, Chapter 5,
<>Karn2a Parva).
<HI>LAMBA1. A daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. Asikni1 wife of
<>Daks2apraja1pati got a hundred daughters and ten of them
<>were married to Dharmadeva. Lamba1 was one of them.
<>(Chapter 15, Am3sa 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>LAMBANI1. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 18,
<>Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>LAMBAPAYODHARA1. A follower of Subrahman2ya
<>(S4loka 21, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva)
<HI>LAMPA1KA. A place of Pura1n2ic fame. In the great epic
<>battle the people of Lampa1ka fought on the side of the
<>Kauravas. They attacked Sa1tyaki and he destroyed the
<>Lampa1kas. (S4loka 42, Chapter 121, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>LAN3GALI1. A celebrated river of Pura1n2ic fame. This
<>river worships Varun2a in the form of a Devi1. (S4loka
<>22, Chapter 9, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>LAN3GHATI1. A river of Pura1n2ic fame. This river sits in
<>the court of Varun2a and worships him.
<HI>LAN3KA1. The kingdom of Ra1van2a.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} It is believed that the present island of
<>Ceylon was the Lan3ka1 of the Pura1n2as, the city of
<>Ra1van2a. This city of Lan3ka1 was situated on the top of
<>the mountain Triku1t2a. This Triku1t2a was a peak
<>of Maha1meru. Because of a fight between Va1suki
<>and Va1yubhagava1n this peak broke away from
<>Maha1meru and fell into the ocean. (See Para 5 under
<>Kubera).
<NI>2) {%History.%} Vis4vakarma1 constructed a magnificent city
<>on the top of the mountain Triku1t2a for the use of
<>Kubera. Kubera lived there adored and worshipped by
<>all. One day Kubera travelled by air in an aeroplane of
<>his. Kaikasi1, mother of Ra1van2a saw that and she became
<>jealous. She called her son to her side and said that
<>at any cost the city of Lan3ka1 on the mount Triku1t2a
<>should be captured and given to her. Ra1van2a along
<>with his brothers went to the Hima1layas and performed
<>penance there and obtained several boons from S4iva. Then
<>Ra1van2a conducted a victory march as an arch-opponen [Page451-a+ 64]
<>of all living forces and drove away Kubera from Lan3ka1
<>and took possession of Lan3ka1 as the place of his abode.
<>He took along with him all the demons residing in
<>Pa1ta1laloka.
<NI>3). {%The design of Lan3ka1.%} Vis4vakarma1, the celebrated
<>architect designed the beautiful Lan3ka1 and the supreme
<>building ability of Maya brought into form the enchant-
<>ing city. On the top of Triku1t2a was the all important
<>Navaratnas4r2n3ga and on a spacious plateau on its top
<>stood the majestic city of Lan3ka1. In the centre was the
<>ten-storeyed palace of Ra1van2a and around it in eight
<>different places stood the nine-storeyed buildings of the
<>great ministers of Ra1van2a. The nine edifices were like
<>the Navagrahas (nine planets) of Lan3ka1. Each of the nine
<>edifices was built with one of the nine gems and the royal
<>palace in the centre was built by using all the nine gems.
<>Even the sun avoided passing over these buildings and
<>changed his path either a bit to the north or to the
<>south making what is known as the Daks2in2a1yana and
<>Uttara1yan2a. (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4). {%No sand in Lan3ka1.%} The ancient belief is that there is
<>no sand in Lan3ka1 The fourth taran3ga of Katha1mukha-
<>lambaka of Katha1saritsa1gara gives a story relating to the
<>reason for this belief.
<NI>Garud2a flew to Devaloka to bring Amr2ta (nectar) to
<>redeem his mother from her servitude to his step-mother.
<>On his way he took an elephant and tortoise from near
<>the a1s4rama of Kas4yapa for his food. He sat on a huge
<>banyan tree to eat them. On the ground below the
<>Ba1lakhilyas were performing penance. The branch on
<>which Garud2a sat with his food sagged and before it
<>broke Garud2a took away the elephant and tortoise
<>and deposited them on the mountain Gandhama1dana
<>near the ocean. The branch broke and fell into the ocean
<>and the city of Lan3ka1 was built on the branch and that
<>was why the ancient people believed there was no sand
<>in Lan3ka1.
<NI>5). {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Sahadeva sent Ghat2otkaca to collect tribute from
<>the King of Lan3ka1 for the Ra1jasu1yayajn5a of Dharma-
<>putra. (Chapter 31, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha).
<NI>(ii) The people of Lan3ka1 attended the Ra1jasu1yayajn5a of
<>Dharmaputra and took charge of serving rice in the
<>feast. (S4loka 23, Chapter 53, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iii) Hanu1ma1n once burnt the city of Lan3ka1 with a fire
<>from his tail. (See under RA1MA).
<NI>(iv) It was Brahma1 who gave Lan3ka1 at first to Kubera.
<>(S4loka 16, Chapter 274, Vana Parva).
<NI>(v) After the death of Ra1van2a, Vibhi1s2an2a was crowned
<>the King of Lan3ka1 (S4loka 5, Chapter 291, Vana Parva).
<HI>LAN3KA1LAKS2MI1. A Devi1 who was relieved of her curse
<>by a hard stroke of his hand by Hanu1ma1n.
<NI>1). {%How she came to Lan3ka1.%} Lan3ka1laks2mi1 was Vijaya-
<>laks2mi1 in her previous birth. She was the watch-girl of
<>the treasury of Brahma1 and one day finding her negli-
<>gent of her duties Brahma1 cursed her “Go to the earth
<>and be the watch-girl of the palace-gate tower of
<>Ra1van2a”. She begged for relief and Brahma1 said, “Dur-
<>ing the incarnation of Vis2n2u as Ra1ma his wife Si1ta1 will
<>be carried away by Ra1van2a and Hanu1ma1n will come in
<>search of her to Lan3ka1. You will then block the way of
<>that mightly monkey and he will then strike you down
<>by a fierce blow of his hand. You will be then released
<>from the curse and come back to me.” [Page451-b+ 64]
<>Vijayalaks2mi1 accordingly was born in Lan3ka1 and
<>became the watch-girl of Ra1van2a's palace.
<NI>2) {%Release from the curse.%} Hanu1ma1n coming to Lan3ka1
<>in search of Si1ta1 tried to find an opening through
<>which to enter Lan3ka1. Then he saw a huge tower-gate
<>on the northern side of the mountain Suvelagiri.
<>When he reached the gate he found it closed. The
<>mighty monkey beat hard on the door and the strong
<>door burst into two and fell on to the floor. Instantly a
<>ferocious woman of enormous size rushed to the gate
<>with a piercing roar and blocked it. Hanu1ma1n found
<>the situation dangerous and so gave her a powerful
<>blow and felled her. She then very politely asked
<>Hanu1ma1n who he was and Hanu1ma1n revealed his
<>identity and told her the purpose of his visit. Lanka1-
<>laks2mi1 then took leave of Hanu1ma1n and leaving
<>Lan3ka1 went to S4ri1 Ra1ma and worshipped him. Ra1ma
<>blessed her and she returned to Satyaloka and started
<>doing her duties as before. (Sundara Ka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>LAPET2IKA1. A holy place. If a man visits this place
<>he would get the benefit of conducting a Va1japeya
<>yajn5a. (S4loka 15, Chapter 58, Vana Parva).
<HI>LAPITA1. The second wife of a sage called Mandapa1la.
<>(See for details under Mandapa1la).
<HI>LATA1. A celestial maiden. She was the companion of

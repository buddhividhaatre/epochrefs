<HI>DHARMABHR2T. A mahars2i who was an inhabitant of
<>Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. This sage narrated to S4ri1 Ra1ma the
<>story of the pond ‘Pan5ca1psara’ and the ga1nadha1ra1 that
<>rises from it. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya, Sarga 11).
<HI>DHARMABUDDHI. See under Mitrabheda.
<HI>DHARMADA. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 72,
<>Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHARMADATTA I. A king of Kosala. He had a wife
<>named Na1gas4ri1. By her chastity she became a celebrity
<>and got the name of Arundhati1 of the earth. They got
<>a daughter named Ta1ra1datta1. Once when Dharmadatta
<>and Na1gas4ri1 were engaged in conversation both remem- [Page225-b+ 64]
<>bered their lives in their previous births. It was not
<>allowed to speak about previous births in open and if
<>anybody did so death was the penalty. But Na1gas4ri1
<>could not control herself and prepared to accept the
<>worst. Na1gas4ri1 told her husband thus: “I am just remin-
<>ded of my life in my previous birth. I will tell you my
<>story. I was the servant maid of a brahmin named
<>Ma1dhava in this same place. I had a husband named
<>Devada1sa then. My husband was the son of a merchant.
<>We made a small house of our own and lived there
<>peacefully. Each of us would bring food from where we
<>worked and everyday we used to set apart a portion of
<>what we got for guests and the pitr2s. We were satisfied
<>with what was left after that. If we got more than one
<>set of clothes we would give it to the poor. Then there
<>came a famine in the country. Our earning also was
<>reduced daily. We lived in hunger. One day a hungry
<>and tired sannya1si1 came to our place and we gave him
<>the whole of our food. My husband died that
<>day and I gave away my life jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of my husband. Then I was born in the family of
<>a King and became your wife.”
<NI>Dharmadatta also got back the memory of his previous
<>birth. He said he was the Devada1sa of Na1gas4ri1's
<>previous life.
<NI>The moment they finished talking about their previous
<>births both fell down dead. Orphaned Ta1ra1datta1 then
<>lived under the care of her mother's younger sister.
<>After some time a Mahars2i came to their house and by
<>his blessing Ta1ra1datta1 got a husband named Kalin3ga-
<>sena. Kalin3gasena was a brave and daring Prince. Very
<>soon they got a daughter and she was named Kalin3ga-
<>sena1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5juka1 lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 2).
<HI>DHARMADATTA II. A Brahmin who lived in the city
<>of Karavi1ra. One day while Dharmadatta was going to
<>the temple with material for pu1ja1 he came across a
<>demoness named Kalaha1 on the way. The brahmin
<>threw the pu1ja1 materials in his hand on to the face of
<>the demoness. When a tulasi1 leaf touched the demoness
<>she got back the memory of her previous birth.
<NI>Kalaha1 then abandoned her cruel nature and begged
<>Dharmadatta to advise her as to how she should get a
<>release from her demonaic life. Taking pity on her
<>Dharmadatta gave her all the ‘pun2ya’ he had obtained
<>by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Chapters 106, 107, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a and Chapters 2, 4, 24, 25
<>Skanda Pura1n2a).
<NI>Dharmadatta and Kalaha1 were born as Das4aratha and
<>Kaikeyi1 in their next births as a result of the accumulat-
<>ed Pun2ya obtained by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Sa1ra
<>khan2d2a, A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>DHARMADHVAJA. See under Tulasi1.
<HI>DHARMAGUPTA I. A prince who obtained blessings
<>from S4iva by observing the Prados2avrata. (For detailed
<>story see Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DHARMAGUPTA II. A Nandara1jakuma1ra belonging to
<>the Lunar dynasty. Chapters 1, 2 and 13 of Skanda
<>Pura1n2a gives the following story about him.
<NI>Once Dharmagupta went to the forests, hunting. Deeply
<>interested in the game he never knew when it became
<>dusk. It was late to go back to the palace and so decid-
<>ing to stay in the forest for the night he climbed upon a
<>tree and made a seat there to rest. After some time a bear [Page226-a+ 64]
<>followed by a lion came running and took refuge on the
<>top of the same tree. The lion stood growling below.
<>Seeing a man on the same tree the bear said “Oh, Prince,
<>we are both in the same sad plight now. Believe me
<>as a friend. We can spend the night on this tree safe.
<>Therefore, go to sleep till midnight and I will keep
<>watch over. After that I will go to sleep and you keep
<>watch”. Gladly accepting the proposal the prince went
<>to sleep and the bear kept vigil. Then the lion suggested
<>to the bear to push down the prince. The bear replied
<>that he would never cheat a friend and that it was a
<>great sin also to do so. After midnight the bear slept
<>and the prince kept watchover. The lion then suggest-
<>ed to the prince to push down the bear. Thinking that
<>he would be saved if the bear is given to the lion the
<>unfaithful prince pushed the bear down. But the bear
<>escaped catching hold of the branches lower down.
<>Embittered at this the bear cursed Dharmagupta and
<>made him mad.
<NI>Then addressing Dharmagupta first and the lion next
<>the bear said thus: “I am Dhya1naka1s2t2ha a sage of the
<>Bhr2gu family. I can take any form I like. I cursed you,
<>Dharmagupta, because you cheated a friend. This lion
<>is Bhadra, one of the ministers of Kubera. Once he
<>entered into sexual act with a bear in front of the
<>a1s4rama of Gautama at midday and the sage cursed him
<>and made him into a lion. The sage as a relief from the
<>curse had further decreed that he would get his origi-
<>nal form when he entered into a conversation with me.”
<>When Dhya1naka1{??}ha finished speaking the lion changed
<>itself into the form of Bhadra.
<NI>Dharmagupta remained mad and his father, the King,
<>approached Jaimini for help. The sage said that the
<>prince would be cured of his madness if he bathed in the
<>Pus2karin2i1 ti1rtha. The king did as was suggested and
<>Dharmagupta was cured.
<HI>DHARMA1KARA. A righteous house-holder. Once a
<>prince entrusted his beautiful wife with Dharma1kara
<>and went away. Though she lived with him for six
<>months he did not have any kind of contact with her.
<>The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse
<>doubts about the chastity of his wife and the house-
<>holder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharma1-
<>kara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victo-
<>rious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but
<>also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed
<>him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i khan2d2a, Chapter 50).
<HI>DHARMAKETU. A king of Bha1rgava gotra. He was the
<>son of Suketu and father of Satyaketu. (Navama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMANANDANA. A king of the family of Bha1rgava.
<>(Navama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMA1N3GADA. A Brahmin who became a deep
<>meditator on Vis2n2u, because of his habits in his previous
<>life. Dharma1n3gada was the son of Rukma1n3gada by
<>his wife Sandhya1vali1. Rukma1n3gada was the son of
<>R2tadhvaja who lived in the city of Vidis4a1. He was
<>a man of good personality, who lived with his
<>father and being a generous man he did not hesitate to
<>give his head to Mohini1 for the pleasure of his father.
<>God Vis2n2u was pleased with him because of his love of
<>his father and of his loyalty to Vais2n2avite deity and took
<>him bodily to heaven (Vaikun2t2ha). Dharma1n3gada [Page226-b+ 64]
<>lived there for many thousands of years enjoying heaven-
<>ly pleasures. Then he went astray from divine life
<>and had to take life again as Suvrata the son of a
<>Brahmin named Somas4arma1.
<NI>The wise Suvrata discarded the passions of Ka1ma (desire),
<>Krodha (anger) etc. and controlled his senses and engag-
<>ed himself in penance in Vaid2u1ryamaha1dri. For hun-
<>dred years he sat in meditation and Maha1vis2n2u was
<>pleased with him and took him and his father to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. At the instruction of Maha1vis2n2u, Suvrata
<>took life again in the house of Kas4yapa. When he died
<>he went to Vaikun2t2ha. In every successive birth he had
<>the remembrance of his previous birth. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 21).
<HI>DHARMANETRA I. A king of the Hehaya family. He
<>was the son of Hehaya and father of Kr2ti. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<HI>DHARMANETRA II. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (S4loka 60,
<>Chapter 94, A1di Parva).
<HI>DHARMAPA1LA. A minister of Das4aratha. There were
<>eight ministers for Das4aratha: Sr2s2t2i, Jayanta, Vijaya,
<>Siddha1rtha, Ra1s2t2ravardhana, As4oka, Dharmapa1la and
<>Sumantra. (Chapter 6, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHARMAPRASTHA. A sacred place. It is believed to
<>be the abode of Dharmara1ja. There is a general assum-
<>ption that anybody who touches the water in a well
<>there will be absolved of all sins. (S4loka 99, Chapter
<>94, Vana Parva).
<HI>DHARMAPUTRA. The eldest of the Pa1n2d2avas, the
<>others being Bhi1masena, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Arjuna.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Pa1n2d2u, brother of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, had two wives,
<>Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. There was a curse for Pa1n2d2u that he
<>would die the moment he touched his wife. (See under
<>Pa1n2d2u). Kunti1, the first wife of Pa1n2d2u, had obtained
<>from Durva1sas five mantras. The mantras were very po-
<>tent. If she called upon any god reciting the mantra that
<>God would manifest himself to her and bless her with a
<>son. When Kunti1 found that Ga1ndha1ri1 was pregnant and
<>was about to deliver she became anxious and meditating
<>on Dharmadeva recited one of the mantras given by Dur-
<>va1sas and got a child from him. The boy was born at mid-
<>day on the eighth Jyes2t2ha day of the year on Pan5cami1
<>and at the auspicious hour, Abhijit. At the time
<>of his birth there was a celestial voice which said “This
<>boy will become a very righteous and bold King, best
<>among the virtuous. He will be known as Yudhis2t2hira”.
<>Obeying the dictate of the mysterious voice he was
<>named Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 123).
<NI>3) {%Boyhood.%} When he had five sons Pa1n2d2u went to the forest
<>of S4atas4r2n3ga together with his family to spend the spring
<>time there. The sages residing in that forest conducted
<>the christening ceremony of Dharmaputra. Kas4yapa,
<>priest of Va1sudeva, performed the Upanayana ceremony
<>(thread-wearing) of Dharmaputra (Chapter 123, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tyapa1t2ha) A1di Parva, M.B.). Ra1jars2i S4uka imparted
<>instructions to Dharmaputra on spear-warfare. Pa1n2d2u
<>died during their stay there. Ma1dri1 abandoned her life
<>by jumping into her husband's funeral pyre. Before
<>doing so she called Dharmaputra to her side and join-
<>ing her hands together said “Son, you are now the father
<>to your brothers.” When Pa1n2d2u and Ma1dri1 were dead
<>the sages of the forest took Kunti1 and the children to
<>Hastina1pura and entrusted them to the care of Bhi1s2ma [Page227-a+ 65]
<>detailing to him all that had happened in the forest.
<>(Chapter 125, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Kauma1ra (youth).%} Dharmaputra and his brothers spent
<>their boyhood in Hastina1pura along with Duryodhana
<>and his brothers. Bhi1masena became a great foe of
<>Duryodhana and his brothers and Duryodhana always
<>nurtured a desire to kill Bhi1masena. Once Duryodhana
<>invited Dharmaputra and his brothers to have aquatic
<>games in the Gan3ga1. Accepting the invitation Dharma-
<>putra participated in the games along with his brothers.
<>One night Duryodhana caught hold of Bhi1ma alone and
<>tied him with ropes and threw him into the river. When in
<>the morning Dharmaputra found his brother missing he
<>ran to his mother to inform her of the loss. Kunti1 asked
<>him to start a search and while he was on it Bhi1masena
<>appeared before him and told him how he was thrown
<>into the river by Duryodhana and how he went to
<>Na1galoka and was brought to earth with great acquisi-
<>tions from there. Dharmaputra advised them not to
<>make the incident public. They received training in
<>warfare in Hastina1pura under Dron2a1ca1rya. Dharmaputra
<>got great proficiency in chariot-fighting. As Gurudaks2in2a1
<>(fee for the preceptor) Dharmaputra agreed to bring
<>Drupada bound before the preceptor. But Arjuna stop-
<>ped him and himself undertook the task (Chapters 127
<>to 136, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Becomes heir-apparent and goes to the forest.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>crowned Dharmaputra as the heir-apparent when the
<>latter had successfully completed his course of study in
<>warfare. By his good conduct, righteousness and adminis-
<>trative efficiency Dharmaputra excelled his father and be-
<>came very popular among his subjects. Jealous of this
<>Duryodhana decided to destroy the Pa1n2d2avas somehow.
<>With the permission of his father, Duryodhana cons-
<>tructed a palace at Va1ran2a1vata for the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>reside there. That palace was built of La1ks2a1 (See
<>under Arakkillam). The entire population resented
<>this act of Duryodhana and rebuked him. They tried
<>to follow Dharmaputra to Va1ran2a1vata and stay there.
<>But by tactful words he made them abandon that idea.
<>Still many brahmins followed Dharmaputra. After some
<>days Duryodhana set fire to the palace. But the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas escaped through a tunnel from the house which had
<>been constructed without the knowledge of Duryodhana
<>just at the time of construction of the building. Escap-
<>ing from there the Pa1n2d2avas reached the forests and
<>travelling farther came to the shore of the Gan3ga1.
<>(S4lokas 138 to 148, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Story up to the life incognito.%}
<NI>(1) When the palace was burnt to ashes it was presumed
<>that they were dead and by the instructions of Dhr2tara1-
<>s2t2ra the funeral rites of the Pa1n2d2avas were conducted
<>at Hastina1pura. But Vidura informed Bhi1s2ma that the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were alive. (Chapter 149, Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha,

<NI>(5) After svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1 the Pa1n2d2avas returned [Page227-b+ 64]
<>to their country and Dharmaputra was crowned king
<>of half of the country. He started his rule at Kha1n2d2ava-
<>prastha, his capital. (Chapter 206, A1di Parva).
<NI>(6) Na1rada went to Kha1n2d2avaprastha and advised them,

<NI>(12) Yudhis2t2hira decided to perform a Rajasu1ya at Indra-
<>prastha. Even before the Ra1jasu1ya S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna
<>and Bhi1masena together killed Jara1sandha. After that
<>Yudhis2t2hira sent Arjuna to the northern side and the
<>other brothers to the southern side for Digvijaya (con-
<>quest of countries). When he established his autocracy
<>he performed the Ra1jasu1ya. (Chapter 45, Sabha1
<>Parva).
<NI>(13) Yudhis2t2hira used to give free sumptuous food to
<>thousands of brahmins in golden pots daily. (Chapter 49,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(14) Envious Duryodhana sent Vidura to bring Dharma-
<>putra to Hastina1pura and defeated him foully in a game
<>of dice. Though Dharmaputra lost everything Dhr2tara1-
<>s2t2ra gave him back everything. (Chapter 72, Sabha1
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(15) Before Dharmaputra went back to his place, with the
<>permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Duryodhana called him back
<>again for another game of dice. Despite protests from
<>all sides Dharmaputra went again for a game of dice
<>with Duryodhana and lost again all he possessed. Then
<>he left the country with his brothers and wife to spend
<>twelve years in exile in the forests and another year
<>incognito. (Chapter 79, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(16) Su1rya gave the Aks2ayapa1tra (a pot which is never

<>at the mountain Mahendra. (Chapter 117, Vana Parva).
<NI>(22) The Pa1n2d2avas then travelled in north India. On
<>their way to the mountain of Gandhama1dana Pa1n5ca1li1 [Page228-a+ 64]
<>fainted and Yudhis2t2hira wept bitterly. (Chapter 145,

<>they returned to Dvaitavana.
<NI>(24) When they went to Ka1myaka vana S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a visited
<>Dharmaputra there. (Chapter 153. Vana Parva).
<NI>(25) Duryodhana and his followers made a grand march
<>to Ka1myaka vana to see the Pa1n2d2avas in sad plight
<>and there the Gandharva Citrasena bound them all by

<>all released. (Chapter 246, Vana Parva).
<NI>(26) While the Pa1n2d2avas were in exile in the forest
<>Dus4s4a1sana went and invited Yudhis2t2hira to attend a
<>Vais2n2ava sacrifice conducted by Duryodhana. But
<>Dharmaputra sent him away saying that it was not

<NI>7) {%How Dharmadava tested Yudhis2t2hira.%} The Pa1n2d2avas
<>travelling through the forests reached Dvaitavana. A
<>brahmin among their group was making fire by the
<>aran2i sticks when a deer rushed at him and took the
<>aran2i sticks away, carrying them on its horns. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas ran after the deer and they travelled far
<>away from their place, still not getting scent of it. They
<>were all tired and thirsty. Yudhis2t2hira directed
<>Nakula to climb on the top of a tree and investigate
<>whether there was any water anywhere nearby. Nakula
<>did so and reported that he could see a pond not far
<>from the place where they were sitting. Yudhis2-
<>t2hira asked Nakula to go and fetch water. Nakula did
<>not return for a long time and Sahadeva was asked to
<>go and enquire. Sahadeva also did not return and
<>Arjuna was sent in search of them. When Arjuna did
<>not return Bhi1masena went to enquire. Bhi1masena also
<>did not return and finally Yudhis2t2hira himself set out in
<>search of them. On reaching the pond Yudhis2t2hira
<>was dumbfounded to see his brothers lying dead on
<>the banks of the pond. Weeping bitterly Yudhis2t2hira
<>entered the pond and to his surprise he heard a voice
<>from the air addressed to him thus: “Ho, Yudhis2t2hira,
<>I am a stork living on the small fishes of this pond.
<>This pond is my hereditary property. It was I who
<>killed your brothers. I will ask you certain questions.
<>If you answer them correctly you can drink from this
<>pond. If not, you will also die.
<NI>Dharmaputra:--“I do not believe that you are simply
<>a bird. My brothers are renowned for their valour and
<>have defeated not only the devas, da1navas, gandharvas
<>and ra1ks2asas but also the four huge mountains like
<>Hima1laya Pa1riya1tra, Vindhya and Malaya. I am eager
<>to know your true self who have slain such brave
<>brothers of mine.”
<NI>Yaks2a:--“I am a Yaks2a and not merely a bird. I
<>objected to your brothers' taking water from the pond. [Page228-b+ 64]
<>But waving aside my objections they started taking
<>water from the pond and then I slew them. Now,
<>hear my questions: Who carries the Sun? Who are his
<>followers? Who makes the sun set? On whom does
<>the sun exist?”
<NI>Dharmaputra:--It is Brahman who carries the Sun.
<>Devas are his followers. Dharma makes him set. He
<>exists on Satya.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How does Maha1siddhi come to he S4rotriyas?
<>(those who study the Vedas).
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--It happens by deep penance.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the reason for a brahmin getting divi-
<>nity? What deed is equal to good conduct? What makes
<>a brahmin mortal and what makes him evil?
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--The Brahmin gets divinity by medita-
<>tion. Austerity is equal to good conduct. Death makes
<>a brahmin mortal and abusive words make him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the divinity of Ks2atriyas? What is
<>equal to good nature? What makes them mortal and
<>what makes them evil?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The divinity of a Ks2atriya is weapon.
<>Sacrifice is equal to good conduct. Fear makes him
<>mortal and non-sacrifice makes him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the best thing for agriculture? What
<>is the most important thing for agriculture? What are
<>the installations of the atmosphere and child-birth?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The best thing for agriculture is rain.
<>The important thing for agriculture is seed. The ins-
<>tallation of atmosphere is rays and that of child-birth
<>is child.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is lifeless even though he breathes?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--He who never offers oblations to a
<>deva, a guest or a servant is like the dead even though
<>he breathes.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is bigger than the earth? What is higher
<>than the sky? What is swifter than the wind? What
<>are greater in number than grass?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Mother is bigger than the earth.
<>Father is taller than the sky. Mind is swifter than the
<>wind. Thoughts are greater in number than grass.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is it that does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep? What is it that does not grow after birth? What
<>is heartless? What grows very quickly?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A fish does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep. An egg does not grow after its birth. A stone
<>is heartless. A river grows very quickly.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a friend to one who lives outside his
<>country? Who is a friend to a householder, to a patient
<>and to one dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--For one who leaves his country the
<>friend he gets on his way is the best friend. To a house-
<>holder his wife is his friend, to a patient his doctor and
<>to one dead, charity.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a guest of all? What is Nectar? What
<>is spread throughout the world?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Agni (fire) is the guest of all. Moon
<>(Candra) is the nectar. Air is that which is spread
<>throughout the world.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who circles around solo? Who is born again?
<>What is the remedy for cold? What gives the maximum
<>yield?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The Sun circles solo. Candra is born
<>again. Fire is the remedy for cold. Earth gives the
<>maximum yield. [Page229-a+ 64]
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the soul of Man? Who is the com-
<>panion given by God? What is Upaji1vana?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The soul of Man is his son. The com-
<>panion given by God is wife. Cloud is Upaji1vana.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How do you become rich? How do you be-
<>come happy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--If you abandon lust you will be rich.
<>If you abandon desire you will be happy.
<NI>Yaks2a:--By what is this world covered? By what does
<>the world become clear? By what does one lose his
<>friend? What is the obstacle for an entry into heaven?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Dullness covers the world. World
<>becomes clear by intelligence. A friend is lost by desire.
<>Domestic ties stand in the way of getting into heaven.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who are those equal to the dead? Which
<>country is dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A poor penniless man is equal to the
<>dead. The country where there is mob-rule is dead.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a pandit? Who is an atheist? Who is
<>wicked? What are lust and jealousy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A righteous man is a pandit. An
<>atheist is wicked. Lust is the cause of worldly life.
<>Jealousy is the cause of worry.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Though charity, wealth and lust are incom-
<>patible with each other when do they unite together?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--When charity and wife compromise
<>the above three blend together harmoniously.
<NI>The Yaks2a was highly pleased with the replies given by
<>Dharmaputra. He then offered to revive one of his bro-
<>thers and asked Dharmaputra to name whom he should
<>do so. Then Yudhis2t2hira named Nakula. Yaks2a then
<>enquired why he had named Nakula leaving aside Arjuna
<>and Bhi1ma. Dharmaputra replied that though Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1 were two wives of Pa1n2d2u they were both
<>mothers to them and so he wanted to see one of the
<>sons of Ma1dri1 alive. He therefore pressed the name of
<>Nakula again. The Yaks2a who was none other than
<>Dharmadeva was immensely happy to hear that reply
<>and gave life to all his brothers. He confessed to
<>Yudhis2t2hira that it was he who in the form of a deer
<>came and ran away with the aran2i sticks. He returned
<>the aran2i sticks also. Dharmadeva then advised them
<>to go and spend their life incognito at the court of King
<>Vira1t2a blessing them with the assurance that they
<>would never be found out during their life in disguise.
<>Dharmadeva disappeared after this and the Pa1n2d2avas
<>returned to their a1s4rama. (Chapters 312 and 313 of
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).

<>s2t2hira went there with an army and challenged him for a
<>fight. (S4loka 18, Chapter 61, S4alya Parva).
<NI>(32) When Yudhis2t2hira won the war he sent S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>to Hastina1pura to console Ga1ndha1ri1. (S4loka 40, Chap-
<>ter 62, S4alya Parva).
<NI>10) {%Yudhis2t2hira is crowned King.%} When Yudhis2t2hira won
<>the war he sent Nakula to bring Pa1n5ca1li1. He went
<>round the Kuruks2etra battle ground and saw his own
<>kith and kin lying dead and the sight made him faint.
<>After that he went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Ga1ndha1ri1 cursed
<>him for killing her sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 gave a piercing
<>look at the nails on the foot of Dharmaputra when he
<>stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 bowing down, Instantly the
<>nails turned black. Yudhis2t2hira gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the
<>names of all the prominent persons who were killed in
<>the war Dhr2tara1s2t2ra ordered Yudhis2t2hira to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. It was at this stage that Yudhis2t2hira
<>came to know from Kunti1 that Karn2a was his brother.
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept bitterly when he knew the secret from
<>his mother and cursed womankind as a whole stating
<>that woman would thereafter be incapable of keeping a
<>secret to herself. The news of the death of Karn2a gave
<>a sudden mental turn-back to Yudhis2t2hira and he
<>decided to renounce all and go to the forest. He
<>called aside his followers and announced his decision to
<>them. At that time Vya1sa came there and preached to
<>him about the perishable nature of life. Yudhis2t2hira
<>then asked him what he should do for the atonement
<>of the sins committed. Though he strongly desired to
<>go to the forest Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did not allow him
<>to do so and sent them all to Hastina1pura. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas entered the city the people gave them a
<>rousing reception and Yudhis2t2hira was crowned King.
<>(Chapters 10 to 17 of Sauptika Parva, Chapters 12 to
<>27 Stri1 Parva, Chapters 1 to 40 S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>11) {%Administration.%} When Yudhis2t2hira became King,
<>with the permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, he distributed the
<>various administrative responsibilities among his bro-
<>thers. He took for himself the task of taking care of
<>their kith and kin and friends. He gave many gifts to
<>the brahmins and other dependants. He once went to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to express his gratitude for him. He visited
<>Bhi1s2ma lying on his bed of arrows accompanied by
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his brothers. Bhi1s2ma revealed to him
<>the inner import of Ra1jadharma, A1paddharma and
<>Moks2adharma. Receiving the blessings of Bhi1s2ma
<>Yudhis2t2hira and his brothers returned to Hastina1pura.
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to the Hima1layas to get riches from
<>Marutta before performing an As4vamedha Sacrifice.
<>While on his way to the Hima1layas he fasted for a night
<>and worshipped S4iva. People like Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>partook in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice was over
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra desired to go to forest and sought the
<>approval of Yudhis2t2hira to do so. On hearing that
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept. But on the advice of Vya1sa he gave his
<>approval for Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to go to forest. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>appealed to him through Vidura for funds to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. Bhi1ma objected to this but [Page230-b+ 65]
<>Yudhis2t2hira reprimanded him and silenced him and
<>gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra enough funds for his purposes. Kunti1
<>and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to the forest.
<>Yudhis2t2hira accompanied by Pa1n5ca1li1 and Sahadeva
<>went and saw them in the forests after a few days.
<>(Chapters 41 to 55, S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 92 from
<>Anus4a1sana Parva and As4vamedha Parva and Chapter
<>26 from A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>12) {%Vidura merges into Dharmaputra.%} When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 went to forest Vidura also accepted
<>sannya1sa and left for the forest. There sitting under a
<>tree he started doing penance. After a few days Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira came to the forest to see his mother and others.
<>After spending some time with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 he went to the place where Vidura was
<>doing penance. Vidura started running the moment he
<>set eyes on Yudhis2t2hira and the latter ran after him.
<>After some time Vidura turned back and stood staring
<>at Yudhis2t2hira. At that time the soul of Vidura escap-
<>ing from his body merged with that of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>The body of Vidura stood stiff and leaned against a tree.
<>Taking him to be dead Yudhis2t2hira started to do the
<>funeral rites and then there resounded a voice from
<>heaven saying that Vidura was not dead. The unknown
<>voice was from Dharmadeva. When the voice subsided
<>Vidura became his old self again. Yudhis2t2hira went
<>back. (Chapter 26, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>13) {%The end of Dharmaputra.%} Soon after his return from
<>the forest Na1rada came to Hastina1pura and told him of
<>the death of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1 in a
<>wild fire in the forest. Lamenting deeply Yudhis2t2hira
<>performed the obsequies at Hastina1pura. It was at
<>this time that the Ya1dava dynasty perished and Dva1raka1
<>was sunk into the ocean. The Pa1n2d2avas then crowned
<>Pari1ks2it as their successor and entrusted Yuyutsu with
<>the administration of the State till Pari1ks2it came of age.
<>Vajra was appointed as chief of Indraprastha. The
<>obsequies of Va1sudeva, Balara1ma and Kr2s2n2a were per-
<>formed at Hastina1pura. Kr2pa1ca1rya was appointed as
<>preceptor to Pari1ks2it. After having made all such
<>arrangements the Pa1n2d2avas commenced their Maha1pras-
<>tha1na. The five Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 started from
<>Hastina1pura. A dog also followed them. Yudhis2t2hira
<>walked ahead. On the way, one by one, Pa1n5ca1li1 Saha-
<>deva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhi1masena fell dead. Alone
<>with a dog to keep company, Yudhis2t2hira reached a
<>plateau on the top of the Hima1layas and there Indra
<>was waiting for him with a chariot. But Yudhis2t2hira
<>said that he would not come to heaven without his
<>wife and brothers. He was then informed that they had
<>already reached heaven. Yudhis2t2hira insisted that the
<>dog also should be taken to heaven which Indra
<>blankly refused. But Yudhis2t2hira refused to ascend the
<>chariot without the dog which, he said, had given him
<>company from the start to the finish. The dog then
<>changed itself into Dharmadeva and he complimented
<>him on his sense of justice. When Yudhis2t2hira entered
<>heaven he saw Duryodhana sitting in all luxury and glory.
<>Yudhis2t2hira did not like it but Na1rada pacified him.
<>Yudhis2t2hira saw all his relatives sitting there. A devadu1ta
<>took him round hell also. When he heard the pitiable
<>groans from there Yudhis2t2hira thought his right place
<>was with them. But Indra and Dharmadeva again con-
<>soled him. He was given a bath in A1ka1s4agan3ga1. He then
<>lost his mortal form and his soul entered Divyaloka. [Page231-a+ 64]
<>Standing in the form of Dharmadeva he saw all his
<>relatives including Kr2s2n2a. (Chapters 38 and 39,
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 1, Mausala Parva;
<>Maha1prastha1nika Parva, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).

<HI>DHARMARA1JA. A king of Gaud2ades4a. He became
<>King at a time when Jainism was getting more and
<>more hold on the people and the Hindu Vedic rites
<>were getting less and less popular among the people.
<>The King thought it was his duty to revive the interest
<>in the Vedic rites and so became a priest himself
<>and did much propaganda on the superiority of the
<>same, writing several books on the subject for the benefit
<>of the people. (Bhavis2yapura1n2a, Pratisarga Parva).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA. A Brahmin. He had many children.
<>The major portion of his life was spent in hard work
<>to support his large family. After that he went in
<>search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he
<>happened to reach the realm of Na1gas (serpents). He
<>entered the house of a Na1ga named Padmana1bha.
<>When he reached the house Padmana1bha had been away
<>carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharma1ran2ya sat out-
<>side the house and spent a few days in vow and medita-
<>tion. Then Padmana1bha returned. The Bra1hman2a asked
<>Padmana1bha about the ways of attaining heaven. The
<>Na1ga replied that there was none superior to the Sun.
<>The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermit-
<>age of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, 4
<>Chapters from 361).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA(M). A forest which is a holy place.
<>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva Chapter 82
<>Stanza 46, that the moment one enters this forest one
<>would become sinless. This place was once the capital
<>of the King named Asu1tarajasa. (See under Kus4a
<>I).
<HI>DHARMARATHA. A king of the family of An3gara1ja.
<>He was the great grandfather of Lomapa1da and the son
<>of Draviratha. (Chapter 277, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHARMASAKHA. A king of the Kekaya line of Kings.
<>He had a hundred wives but no children. At last, at an
<>old age, he got a son of Sucandra1, wife of his elder
<>brother. But the hunderd wives of Dharmasakha were
<>pining for having a son and so the king consulted his
<>ministers and on their advice conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i
<>yajn5a (a sacred sacrificial ceremony for obtaining chil-
<>dren) at Hanu1matkun2d2a near the southern sea-coast.
<>As a result of that each of his hundred wives got a
<>child. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapter 15).
<HI>DHARMAS4ARMA1 I. A brahmin who was born a parrot
<>named Kan5jala in his rebirth. Dharmas4arma1 was one of [Page231-b+ 65]
<>the three sons of an eminent Brahmin called Vidya1dhara.
<>His other two sons were Vasus4arma1 and Na1mas4arma1.
<>While both his brothers became great scholars Dhar-
<>mas4arma1 never studied anything and became a muff.
<>His father was greatly worried on account of this.
<>Dharmas4arma1 never heeded the advice of his father
<>and went about in bad company ruining himself. Years
<>went by and Dharmas4arma1 became old.
<NI>One day Dharmas4arma1 was sitting repentant in a
<>temple sadly pondering over his past when a siddha
<>came to the temple. Watching him Dharmas4arma1 saw
<>him go and sit in a lonely place for meditation with his
<>eyes shut. Dharmas4arma1 went and stood near him
<>very respectfully. When the Siddha opened his eyes
<>after some time he saw Dharmas4arma1 standing before
<>him and then the Siddha made enquiries about Dhar-
<>mas4arma1. The latter then requested the Siddha to give
<>him instructions to acquire the supreme knowledge.
<>The Siddha then gave him Jn5a1nopades4a (advice on
<>knowledge) and Dharmas4arma1 soon became a Siddha
<>himself. He then started on a pilgrimage and on the
<>way he got a parrot. He took care of the bird just like
<>his son and loved it very affectionately. One day when
<>Dharmas4arma1 was away from the place to collect
<>fruits for his food a cat caught and ate the parrot.
<>Greatly grief-stricken Dharmas4arma1 wept bitterly and
<>ran about like a mad man. After some days he died
<>and because at the time of death he was thinking about
<>the parrot he was born a parrot in his next birth. The
<>jn5a1nopades4a of the siddha was still lingering in him
<>while he died and so even in his life as a parro the never
<>lost the jn5a1na he had acquired in his previous life.
<>(Chapter 122, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHARMAS4ARMA1 II. See under S4ivas4arma1.
<HI>DHARMASA1VARN2I. The eleventh Manu. (See under
<>Manvantara).
<HI>DHARMASVA. A Brahmin. Once this Brahmin was
<>coming home with water from the Gan2ges. On the way
<>he saw Ka1pakalpa, the servant of merchant Ratna1kara,
<>being killed by an ox. Though Ka1pakalpa was a sinner,
<>his end aroused pity in the heart of the Brahmin. So he
<>sprinkled the Ganges-water on the body of Ka1pakalpa,
<>who instantly regained life and energy. The Brahmin
<>who saw the power of Ganges-water began to worship
<>the Ganges from that day onwards. It is mentioned in
<>Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Khan2d2a, Chapter 7, that finally
<>the Brahmin got a boon from the Ganges that only
<>uttering the name of the Ganges should he meet with
<>death.
<HI>DHARMATI1RTHA I. A holy place of ancient Bha1rata.
<>If a man bathes in a pond there, he would be absolved
<>of all sins. (S4loka 1, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<HI>DHARMATI1RTHA II. Another holy place of ancient
<>Bha1rata. If a person bathes in a pond there he would
<>get the benefit of performing a Va1japeya Sacrifice (S4loka
<>162, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<HI>DHARMAVARN2A. A Brahmin who lived in the country
<>of A1narta at the end of Kaliyuga. Once when he went
<>to the land of the dead, he saw his fathers hanging by
<>the end of darbha. They requested Dharmavarn2a to
<>marry and obtain sons who would get them relief from
<>their plight. Dharmavarn2a married and as soon as he
<>got a son he went to the forest of Gandhama1dana to
<>practise penance there. (Chapters 2, 17 and 22, Skanda
<>Pura1n2a). [Page232-a+ 64]
<HI>DHARMAVATI1. A wife of Dharmadeva. He got of
<>Dharmavati1 a daughter Dharmavr2ta1. Dharmavr2ta1 was
<>married to Mari1ci, son of Brahma1. (See under Gaya1-
<>ti1rtha).
<HI>DHARMAVR2TA1. A daughter of Dharmadeva. (See
<>under Gaya1ti1rtha).
<HI>DHARMAVYA1DHA. Though he was born in the caste
<>of foresters he became a saint by following the path of
<>duty and righteousness. In his previous birth he was a
<>Brahmin. He was a friend of a king who was an adept
<>in archery. Once both went on hunting expedition to the
<>forest. The brahmin sent an arrow at a wild animal but
<>the arrow went and struck a sage who was doing
<>penance under a tree. When the sage was rolling on the
<>arrow he said: “Oh, evil-natured Bra1hman2a, may you
<>be born as a hunter selling flesh in your next life.” The
<>Brahmin went and apologised to the sage and craved
<>for pardon. Taking pity on him the sage consoled him
<>by saying that though he would be born as such, he
<>would be a great scholar and attain moks2a by doing his
<>duty without even once wavering from it.
<NI>The Brahmin was born a hunter in the country of
<>Mithila1 He took to looking after his parents as a vow
<>and soon became a top-ranking righteous man. He did
<>his duty to which he was born. He sold meat and
<>earned a living. He never killed or butchered an animal.
<>One day a Brahmin named Kaus4ika was doing penance
<>sitting under a tree when a crane perched on the top
<>of its branches defiled the Brahmin's head with its
<>droppings. The Brahmin in rage looked up and his
<>powerful stare burnt the crane and it fell down dead.
<>Leaving that place some time later he went to a house
<>to beg. The house-wife informed him that he would be
<>given alms only after attending to her husband. The
<>Brahmin was not pleased with her reply. Seeing that she
<>added “Please do not look at me like that. I am no
<>crane. To me my husband is supreme.”
<NI>The Brahmin was taken aback when he heard the lady
<>mention the incident of the crane. The lady explained
<>to him that all her powers were due to her devotion to
<>her husband and advised the Brahmin to go and meet
<>Dharmavya1dha of Mithila1 to remove the egoism in him.
<>Obeying her instructions Kaus4ika went and accepted
<>Dharmavya1dha as his guru. The learned hunter then
<>spoke to Kaus4ika about Varn2adharmas, S4is2t2a1ca1ras,
<>him3sa1 and ahim3sa1, Mi1ma1m3sa1 relating to dharma and
<>karma, the importance and glory of Brahmavidya1, the
<>significance of the control of the senses, Trigun2as, Pra1n2a-
<>va1yu, service to father and mother and many such
<>other things. The egoism of Kaus4ika was removed and
<>he returned home. Devoted to his parents he attained
<>heaven. (Chapters 27 to 33, Vana Parva).
<HI>DHARMA1YU. A king of the Pu1ru family. His father
<>was Raudra1s4va, the son of Pu1ru and his mother was a

<NI>1) {%General information.%} A fierce Ra1ks2asa (giant) with the
<>figure of a donkey. He lived in the forest of Ka1li1 (Ta1la).
<>People did not dare to pass by that way fearing this
<>giant. Hearing about him, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his elder
<>brother Balabhadra Ra1ma went to the forest. There
<>were several palm trees in the forest, the fruits of which
<>they shook with force. Hearing the noise Dhenuka ran
<>to them. Balabhadra and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a beat the giant to
<>death.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%} (1) In Bha1gavata, Skandha 10, it is

<HI>DHI1MA1N. Second son of Puru1ravas. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 75, Stanza 24).
<HI>DHI1RADHI1. A brahmin devotee of S4iva. He lived in
<>Ka1s4i1. Because he meditated on S4iva alone, S4iva was
<>pleased with him and helped him in various ways.
<NI>The gan2as of S4iva were amazed at S4iva's partiality for
<>Dhi1radhi1. Paramas4iva told them the story of the former
<>birth of Dhi1radhi1. “This Brahmin was a swan in his
<>former life. Once he was flying over a lake when he
<>became tired and fell down. His colour became black.
<>Then Kamalini1, another swan who dwelt in the same
<>lake told him to recite the tenth Chapter of Gi1ta1, and
<>to meditate on S4iva. Because the swan did that holy
<>act, he was born a Brahmin in his next birth. Though
<>he was a Brahmin in his previous birth, he kicked his
<>teacher and for that fault he had to take birth as a
<>swan. Later, because of the love of S4iva, Dhi1radhi1
<>attained heaven. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 184).
<HI>DHI1ROS2N2I. A god concerned with S4ra1ddha (offering

<>born of fire. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 18).
<HI>DHR2S2T2A. A son of Vaivasvata Manu. Iks2va1ku, Nabha1ga,
<>Dhr2s2t2a, S4arya1ti, Naris2yanta, Pra1m3s4u. Nr2ga, Dis2t2a,

<>Manu. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>DHR2S2T2ABUDDHI. A Vais4ya who attained heaven by
<>performing the fast of Vais4a1kha Vrata. He lived in the
<>country of Bhadra1vati1, on the bank of the River
<>Sarasvati1. The name of the king of the country was
<>Dhr2tima1n. Dhanapa1la, a Vais4ya of that country had
<>five sons: Sumanas, Dyutima1n, Medha1vi1, Sukr2ta and
<>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi. The last of them turned out to be a
<>wicked man. Going after many women, keeping
<>company with wicked people, gambling, wandering
<>about in search of harlots, not venerating Gods, Manes
<>or Bra1hman2as, wasting the money of his father, eating
<>untouchable food, drinking liquor and such other acts,
<>he indulged in. Once he was seen walking in the
<>street with his hand on the shoulder of a harlot. So his
<>father turned him out of the house. He was discarded
<>by his relatives too. He sold the ornaments he had on
<>his body. When that was finished the harlots also
<>evaded him. He became a destitute having no money
<>or clothes. When he became tired with hunger and
<>thirst he began stealing in that city. The King's men
<>caught him. They chained him and scourged him.
<>Finally, he went to the forest and with a bow and
<>arrows he lived by hunting.
<NI>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi happened to reach the hermitage of
<>Kaun2d2inya. It was the month of Vais4a1kha. While
<>Kaun2d2inya was coming from the Ganges, having taken
<>bath, a drop of water fell on Dhr2s2t2abuddhi from the
<>wet cloth of the hermit, and consequently his sins were
<>washed off. He fell before the hermit and requested
<>him to instruct him in the way of attaining heaven. [Page234-a+ 65]
<>The hermit advised him to observe the fast of Vais4a1kha-
<>s4uklaika1das4i1 known as Mohini1. Accordingly he observed
<>the fast and became sinless. Invested with a divine form
<>he entered the realm of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Chapter 51).
<HI>DHR2S2T2ADYUMNA. The son of King Drupada. He was
<>brother of Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Drupada and Dron2a were fellow students. After
<>finishing his education Drupada became King. When
<>Dron2a came to his palace Drupada did not honour
<>him. Dron2a got angry, went to Hastina1pura and began
<>to teach the Pa1n2d2ava and the Kaurava princes in
<>archery and other weapons. When the weapon-training
<>was over, Arjuna, at the instruction of Dron2a, defeated
<>and captured Drupada. Dron2a seized half of his king-
<>dom from him.
<NI>As Drupada was not powerful to wreak vengeance on
<>Dron2a, he performed a sacrifice to obtain a son who
<>could take revenge on Dron2a and regain his lost
<>prestige. A son and a daughter were born from the
<>sacrificial fire. The son was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna.
<>The daughter grew up and became the famous Pa1n5ca1li1.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas married her.
<NI>At the time of birth, Dhr2s2t2adyumna had a crown on
<>his head, and armour on his body, bow, arrows and
<>sword in his hands. He ran out of the fire into a
<>chariot and sat in it as if he were about to begin a
<>travel of conquest. Seeing this the Pa1n5ca1las were filled
<>with joy. There was a celestial voice: “This boy will
<>destroy the fear of the Pa1n5ca1las. He is born to slay
<>Dron2a.” At this time the queen approached the sacri-
<>ficing priest with a request that the children born of the
<>sacrificial fire should consider her as their mother.
<>Accordingly the children accepted the wife of Drupada
<>as their mother. Bra1hman2as named the boy Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna and the girl Kr2s2n2a1.
<F>1. The fast taken on the eleventh day of the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Vais4a1kha.</F>
<F>2. Because he was born with Dhr2s2t2atva (boldness) amars2atva (impatience) and dyumna (vigour) the son of Drupada was
<>called Dhr2s2t2adyumna. Draupadi1 was called Kr2s2n2a as she was of Kr2s2n2a varn2a (dark complexion. Thus Drupada got two children from
<>‘Makha’ (sacrifice).</F> (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>166). (For more particulars see under ‘Pa1n5ca1li1’
<>Para 2).
<NI>2) {%Till the battle of Bha1rata.%} The history of Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna till the battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas, is given below.
<NI>The news that Dhr2s2t2adyumna was born to kill Dron2a
<>spread everywhere. The Broad-minded Dron2a did not
<>seem to mind this news. Dron2a took Dhr2s2t2adyumna to
<>his house, with the permission of Drupada and gave
<>him training in the wielding of weapons. He believed
<>that God's will could not be thwarted. After he had
<>learned archery Dhr2s2t2adyumna returned to his kingdom.
<>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna at the svayam3vara
<>(marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li. Several kings arrived from
<>various countries on that occasion. When the auspici-
<>ous moment came, Dhr2s2t2adyumna brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to
<>the nuptial dais. He proclaimed the rules and condi-
<>tions that the competitors of Svayam3vara had to
<>observe. After that he conversed with each king who
<>was present. In the Svayam3vara Pa1n5ca1li1 accepted
<>Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 were given the
<>Kumbhaka1ra mandira (the Palace of Kumbhaka1ra) which
<>stood in the city of Drupada, to stay for that night.
<>Though the Pa1n2d2avas were in the guise of Bra1hman2as,
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna had his own doubts about their identity. [Page234-b+ 61]
<>So he hid himself somehwere in the Palace and kept an
<>eye on them. This shows his peculiar trait of obser-
<>vation. After this he returned to his Palace and
<>pacified his father who had been much worried about
<>his daughter's selection.
<NI>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna, during the time of the
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas. He consoled Pa1n5ca1li1, who
<>was miserable. After that he took the sons of Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>to his house. While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the
<>forest ‘Ka1myaka’, Dhr2s2t2adyumna visited them. The
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas came to an end. A battle
<>between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas became inevi-
<>table. Then the Pa1n2davas selected Dhr2s2t2adyumna, as
<>the commander-in-general of their army. He ordered
<>for a general parade of the army and gave them
<>instructions. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 166 to 195;

<>eight sons. But seven of them were thrown into the
<>river Gan3ga1. Giving the eighth son Bhi1s2ma to S4antanu
<>Gan3ga1 disappeared. S4antanu then married Satyavati1,
<>a fisher-woman. Satyavati1 gave birth to two sons, Cit-
<>ra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya. When S4antanu grew old,
<>Citra1n3gada was anointed as King, as Bhi1s2ma had taken
<>Brahmavrata (vow of celibacy). Once when Citra1n3-
<>gada went to the forest for hunting, a Gandharva of the
<>name Citra1n3gada killed him. So Vicitravi1rya became
<>the King of Hastina1pura. Bhi1s2ma took the three daugh-
<>ters of the King of Ka1s4i, Amba1, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 [Page236-a+ 65]
<>by force into his chariot and brought the last two, to
<>Hastina1pura to be given as wives to Vicitravi1rya. On
<>the way he sent Amba1 back. Vicitravi1rya married Am-
<>bika1 and Amba1lika1. But shortly after that he also died,
<>before any children were born to him. Fearing that the
<>Lunar dynasty would come to an end, Satyavati1 brought
<>her son Vedavya1sa, who was born to her from hermit
<>Para1s4ara, before her marriage, to Hastina1pura. In the
<>night Satyavati1 sent Ambika1 adorned with ornaments
<>and costly garments, to the bedroom of Vya1sa. But she
<>could not bear to lie with Vya1sa who was clad in barks
<>of the tree and wearing matted hair. Still thinking that
<>it was not right on her part to stand against the wish of
<>her mother, she approached Vya1sa and lay with him
<>with closed eyes. Ambika1 became pregnant. The child
<>she gave birth to, was blind. That child was Dhr2tara1s2t2r2a.
<>Next night Amba1lika1 approached Vya1sa. When she
<>saw Vya1sa she turned pale at his uncouth figure and
<>her face became bloodless. So the child born to her was
<>pale and was called Pa1n2d2u. Next night the maid of the
<>queen approached Vya1sa with a joyful heart and so she
<>got Vidura as son, who was extremely wise and intelli-
<>gent. Thus Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura became sons
<>of the same father.
<F>1. It is stated in M.B. A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 7 that Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born as the incarnation of a Gandharva

<>marriageable age. Bhi1s2ma had heard about Ga1ndha1ri1,
<>daughter of Subala, the King of Ga1ndha1ra, as a beauti-
<>ful damsel of good qualities. Moreover she had acquired
<>a boon from S4iva that hundred sons would be born to
<>her. Bhi1s2ma sent a messenger to Subala with a request
<>to give Ga1ndha1ri1 as wife to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Subala was
<>not much pleased at the aspect of getting a blind man
<>as son-in-law. Still he thought of the prestige his family
<>would get by a marriage alliance with the kings of the
<>Pu1ru Dynasty, and finally agreed. Ga1ndha1ri1 submitted
<>to the will of her father, and to live with a husband who [Page236-b+ 63]
<>was blind. She tied her eyes with a cloth. S4akuni the
<>son of Subala brought Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1pura, and
<>gave her to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. With the sanction of Bhi1s2ma
<>their marriage took place.
<NI>Once Ga1ndha1ri1 feasted Vya1sa who came tired with hun-
<>ger and thirst. The hermit was pleased with her and
<>blessed her to have hundred sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 became
<>pregnant. But even after two years no delivery took place.
<>She crushed her womb by force and a lump of flesh
<>came out. At that time Vya1sa came there. He cut the
<>lump into hundred pieces and kept them in ghee-pots.
<>Gandha1ri1 had a desire to get a daughter also. Vya1sa
<>who had known it had cut the lump in such a way that
<>there was a small piece in excess. The pots broke by
<>themselves in due course and hundred sons and a
<>daughter were born. The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1.
<>A son named Yuyutsu also was born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of a
<>Vais4ya woman. Duryodhana was the eldest of the
<>hundred sons. The children grew up. Dus4s4ala1 was
<>given in marriage to Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.

<>a curse from a hermit that he would die if his wife tou-
<>ched him. With that Pa1n2d2u retired to forest with his
<>wives. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved at the separation of
<>his brother. Pa1n2d2u died in the forest and Ma1dri1 jumped
<>into fire and died with her husband. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked
<>Vidura to perform their cremation rites. After that
<>Yudhis2t2hira became King. The Pa1n2d2avas became more
<>and more prosperous. This made the heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>cloudy. He gave sanction to Duryodhana to transfer the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to the lac house in Va1ran2a1vata. The lac house
<>caught fire and it was rumoured that the Pa1n2d2avas died
<>in the lac house fire, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra shed crocodile
<>tears, and ordered for the mourning and oblation to
<>be performed. After the marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1, it came to
<>be known that the Pa1n2d2avas were alive and that they
<>were living with Drupada. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra recalled them and
<>gave them half of the country. The Pa1n2d2avas made
<>Indraprastha their capital and began to rule the king-
<>dom. Yudhis2t2hira performed the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(royal consecration). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra also took part in the
<>sacrifice.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge Yudhis2t2hira to a
<>game of dice. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed but advised Duryo-
<>dhana not to live in enmity with the Pa1n2d2avas. The
<>game of dice was played, and Yudhis2t2hira lost every-
<>thing the Pa1n2d2avas had. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called Pa1n5ca1li1
<>and told her that she might ask any boon. She request-
<>ed that her husband Dharmaputra might b{??} exempt-
<>ed from servitude and the Pa1n2d2avas made free. Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra compelled her to ask for more boons. She replied
<>that according to law Vais4yas were eligible for one boon,
<>Ks2atriya women two boons, Kings three boons and
<>Bra1hman2as hundred boons, and since she had already
<>taken two boons, she wanted no more. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra who
<>was pleased at this reply gave the Pa1n2d2avas freedom
<>and returned all their lost wealth.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge the Pa1n2d2avas for a
<>game of dice again. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed. This time also
<>Yudhis2t2hira lost the game. The Pa1n2d2avas who had lost
<>everything, were ordered to go to forest for twelve years
<>and to live incognito for one year. The Pa1n2d2avas went [Page237-a+ 65]
<>to the forest with Pa1n5ca1li1. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved.
<NI>After thirteen years the Pa1n2d2avas returned. Duryo-
<>dhana said that not an inch of land would be given to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra felt sorry at this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>came to talk about conciliation. Duryodhana wanted to
<>take him a prisoner. But Dhr2tara1s2t2ra opposed it. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a showed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra his Vis4varu1pa (cosmic form)
<>to see which, Kr2s2n2a gave him sight for the time being
<>for which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was very thankful. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas came to Kuruks2etra for Bha1rata-battle.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called San5jaya to him and asked him about
<>the preparations the parties had made for war. San5jaya
<>gave a true description of the battle arrays of both
<>parties. (M.B. A1di Parva. Sabha1 Parva, Vana Parva,

<NI>(6) {%Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the battle of Bha1rata.%} The terrible
<>battle began. The heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved with
<>sorrow. When Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jaya-

<>S4a1tyaki had destroyed the army of the Kauravas he
<>became dumb with grief. He praised Bhi1ma's valour
<>and blamed his sons. When San5jaya told him
<>about the fall of Karn2a, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra fell down
<>unconscious. He rose up again and attended to the
<>noises from the battlefield. He fell down again when
<>he knew that S4alya and Duryodhana were killed. He
<>rose again and cried for a long time. He gathered the
<>women-folk, his people and went to the battlefield.
<>He broke the metal statue of Bhi1ma and embraced the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He asked Yudhis2t2hira to do the mourning
<>and offerings for the dead. It was done accordingly.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas respected Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. But Bhi1ma
<>scolded them. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 were greatly
<>depressed and asked Yudhis2t2hira to permit them to live
<>in forest. Yudhis2t2hira tried to prevent it. He kissed on
<>the head of Yudhis2t2hira. Seeing that they did not eat
<>food he asked them to eat. Yudhis2t2hira saw that they
<>would eat only if he permitted them to live in forest.
<>At last Yudhis2t2hira agreed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted
<>money from Dharmaputra and performed mourning
<>and offerings for the dead on a large scale (M.B. Dron2a

<>from Maha1vis2n2u, Dhruva returned. All who were there
<>embraced Dhruva. Years passed by. Utta1napa1da left
<>his kingdom to Dhruva and became a forest house-
<>holder. Dhruva became King. The King Dhruva
<>married Bra1hmi1, the daughter of S4is4uma1ra a Praja1pati.
<>The queen gave birth to two sons Kalpa and Vatsara.
<>Dhruva married Ila1 the daughter of Va1yu (wind). She
<>gave birth to a son named Utkala.
<NI>Uttama remained unmarried. While he was hunting in
<>the forest a Yaks2a (a demi-god) killed him. Suruci was
<>caught in wild fire and died. Hearing about the death
<>of Uttama, Dhruva took his weapons and reached the
<>realm of the Yaks2as. He stood at their gate and
<>challenged them for battle. One lac and thirty thousand
<>Yaks2a warriors fought with Dhruva. Dhruva destroyed
<>the entire army. The Yaks2as began illusive and
<>magical arts. Dhruva overcame that also. At last
<>Kubera himself appeared before Dhruva and blessed
<>him. They got him into a plane and placed him in a
<>place higher than all the planets. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%The descendants of Dhruva.%} Two sons named S4is2t2i and
<>Bhavya were born to Dhruva by his wife S4ambhu.
<>Succha1ya1 the wife of S4is2t2i gave birth to five sinless sons
<>named Ripu, Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2katejas.
<>Br2hati1 the wife of Ripu gave birth to Ca1ks2us2a of extreme
<>bright complexion. Manu was born to Ca1ks2us2a by his
<>wife Pus2karan2i1 the daughter of Vi1ran2apraja1pati and in-
<>cluded in the children of Varun2a. Ten sons were born
<>to the bright Manu by his wife Nad2vala1, daughter
<>of Praja1pati Vaira1ja. These ten bright sons were Kuru,
<>Pu1ru, S4atadyumna Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2-
<>t2oma1, Atira1tra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. A1gneyi1,
<>the wife of Kuru gave birth to six children.
<>They were An3ga, Sumanas, Khya1ti, Kratu, An3giras
<>and S4ibi. A son named Vena was born to An3ga [Page239-a+ 63]
<>by his wife Suni1tha1. Hermits churned the right hand
<>of Vena to obtain children. As a result of churning
<>Vaineya was born from the right hand of Vena. That
<>King is the famous Pr2thu. This Pr2thu milked the earth
<>for the prosperity of his subjects. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a
<>1, Chapter 13).
<NI>5) {%The place of Dhruva.%} The origin of the river Gan3ga1
<>was through the hole at the top of the shell of the
<>mundane egg. It flowed down and fell on the highest
<>part of heaven. That place is called Vis2n2upa1da. Sitting
<>in this Vis2n2upa1da, Dhruva does penance to Vis2n2u. So
<>this place got the name Dhruvaman2d2ala. (Devi1 Bha1ga-

<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 75).
<HI>DHRUVARATNA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 4).
<HI>DHRUVASANDHI. A king of Kosala. During the reign
<>of this King there was prosperity in Ayodhya1 and the
<>people were virtuous. This king had two wives
<>Manorama1 and Li1la1vati1. A son named Sudars4ana was
<>born to Manorama1. After a month the second wife
<>also gave birth to a son named S4atrujit. The King was
<>much pleased and both sons were brought up alike.
<>As S4atrujit was cleverer than Sudars4ana people loved
<>S4atrujit more.
<NI>Once Dhruvasandhi went to the forest for hunt-
<>ing and was killed by a lion in the forest. Accord-
<>ing to the custom Sudars4ana became King. Li1la1-
<>vati1, the mother of S4atrujit was the daughter of the
<>King of Ujjayini1. Her desire was to make S4atrujit the
<>King. Manorama1. the mother of Sudars4ana was the
<>daughter of the King of Kalin3ga. Hearing about the
<>death of Dhruvasandhi, the kings of Ujjayini1 and
<>Kalin3ga arrived at Ayodhya1. The King of Ujjayini1
<>got angry because Sudars4ana was made king and
<>began war. The King of Kalin3ga took the side of
<>Sudars4ana. A terrible battle was fought in Ayodhya1
<>as to who should be the heir to the throne. In the
<>battle Yudha1jit, the King of Ujjayini1, killed Vi1rasena,
<>the king of Kalin3ga. Sudars4ana and his mother
<>Manorama1 were in a sorry plight. According to the
<>advice of minister Vidulla, Manorama1 and Sudars4ana
<>fled from the capital. Vidulla and the maid of
<>Manorama1 accompanied them. In two days they
<>reached Gan3ga1tat2a. They were caught by fishermen
<>thieves and they lost everything they had. At last with
<>the help of a boat they crossed the Ganges and reached
<>Triku1t2a. They went to the hermitage of Bharadva1ja [Page239-b+ 64]
<>who was doing penance there. He gave them protec-
<>tion.
<NI>After making S4atrujjit King, Yudha1jit began to search
<>for Manorama1 and Sudars4ana. He got news that they
<>lived in Citraku1t2a. Yudha1jit went there with an army.
<>But he could not get them out of the hermitage of
<>Bharadva1ja. Manorama1 and Sudars4ana lived safely in
<>the hermitage.
<NI>Once Vidulla came to the hermitage of Bharadva1ja to
<>enquire about Manorama1. Seeing the old man the
<>hermit boys called out “Kli1ba Kli1ba.” Prince Sudars4ana
<>heard only “Kli1”. The syllable ‘Kli1’ is the spell called
<>‘Ka1mara1ja bi1jamantra’. Without knowing its meaning
<>Sudars4ana called out ‘Kli1’ several times. With that the
<>prince got a special power.
<NI>Six more years passed. The prince became eleven years
<>old. By this time Bharadva1ja had taught the prince
<>Vedas, S4a1s4tras, etc. The prince was a devotee of Devi1.
<>Devi1 appeared before him and gave him a bow and a
<>quiver which would never become empty, and an
<>impenetrable armour. Sudars4ana married S4as4ikala1 the
<>daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1. Nis2a1da, the King of
<>S4r2n3giverapura, was a friend of Dhruvasandhi. He gave
<>Sudars4ana a chariot which Sudars4ana rode through the
<>forest. With the help of the King of Ka1s4i1 and others
<>Sudars4ana recaptured Ayodhya1. He made Vidulla his
<>minister and ruled over the country for a long time.

<HI>DHUNDHU I. A notorious Asura. He was the son of
<>the Madhu Kait2abhas.
<NI>Brahma1 was born in the lotus from the navel of Vis2n2u,
<>who was lying in meditation on the surface of water.
<>From the ear-wax of Vis2n2u two asuras--Madhu and
<>Kait2abha sprang up. They terrified Brahma1 by sha-
<>king the stalk of the lotus. Brahma1 became terribly
<>afraid of the asuras and ran about on the surface of
<>water. Hearing the cry of Brahma1 Vis2n2u awoke, but
<>he could not defeat the asuras. Vis2n2u decided to
<>employ ‘Sa1ma’ (conciliation) the first expedient. The
<>arrogant demons ordered Vis2n2u to ask of them any
<>boon. Vis2n2u replied. “If it is so, you must be killed by
<>me.” They could not but give the boon. They agreed
<>to the request of Vis2n2u and said: “But we must be
<>killed in an atmosphere, which is not cloudy.” Vis2n2u
<>killed them when the atmosphere was clear.
<NI>A son named Dhundhu had been born to Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. Because Vis2n2u had killed his fathers
<>Dhundhu decided to take revenge on Vis2n2u and the
<>Gods. With this idea in view Dhundhu began to do
<>penance in the sandy desert of Ujja1laka in Marudhanva.
<>Standing on one leg he did penance for thousands of
<>years. Then Brahma1 appeared before him and gave the
<>boon that he would not be killed by Devas, Da1navas
<>(asuras), Gandharvas (Demi-gods), Ra1ks2asas (demons),
<>Yaks2as (paragods) and Uragas (serpents). Having got
<>this boon, he lived under sand in the desert of Ujja1laka.
<>His idea was to destroy the gods.
<NI>A hermit named Uttan3ka had erected his hermitage in
<>another part of Marudhanva and began penance. By his
<>penance he made Vis2n2u appear before him and then
<>made a request that Dhundhu's activities be put a
<>stop to. Vis2n2u replied “Uttan3ka! Dhundhu has become
<>a curse to the three worlds. There is a king named
<>Kuvala1s4va, born of the dynasty of Iks2va1ku. He will
<>kill Dhundhu.” Saying these words, Vis2n2u disappear-
<>ed.
<NI>Uttan3ka went to the palace of Kuvala1s4va and told
<>him what Vis2n2u had said. Kuvala1s4va and his sons
<>went to the forest and killed Dhundhu in a fight.
<>From that day Kuvala1s4va came to be known by the [Page240-b+ 64]

<HI>DHYA1NA. (Meditation). Even from ancient times the
<>people of Bha1rata believed that heaven could be attain-
<>ed by meditation. There are scientific methods of
<>meditating upon God. They are described below:
<NI>The root “dhyai”, means “to think”. Dhya1na (medi-
<>tation) means thinking of God with concentration.
<>God is invisible and figureless. We can meditate only
<>upon some material that contains the attributes of God.
<>So dhya1na (meditation) is to fix the mind on the
<>object of meditation, and to imagine that particular
<>object in a particular place and to concentrate the
<>mind upon it. One who casts off his body, while engag-
<>ed in meditation attains ‘Sa1yujya’ (oneness with God). [Page241-a+ 64]
<NI>He who can meditate upon God, with concentration
<>of mind even for a moment or two can attain heaven.
<>The fruits he attains are far greater than the fruits
<>attained by performing great sacrifices and offerings.
<>For meditation, there are four factors: Dhya1ta1 (the
<>meditator), Dhya1na (the act of meditation) Dhyeya
<>(the object meditated upon) and Dhya1naprayojana
<>(the attainment by meditation). He who indulges in
<>meditation is the meditator. The act done by him is
<>meditation. That which is meditated upon is the object
<>of meditation. What the meditator obtains as a result
<>of his meditation is the attainment. A meditator should
<>be wise and virtuous, should have attention and patie-
<>nce, devoted to Vis2n2u and always energetic.
<NI>We can meditate upon God, walking, standing, sleeping
<>and awake. God should be consecrated in the centre of
<>the lotus chair of the heart and be worshipped with de-
<>votional meditation. It is to give practice in fixing the
<>mind firmly on a particular object, that the sages say
<>that some visible material object should be given to
<>meditate upon, in the early stage of meditation. When
<>concentration of mind is obtained by meditating upon
<>a visible object, it will be possible for us to meditate
<>upon an object which is not amenable to our senses.
<>When engaged in meditation we should be thinking
<>“Aham3 Brahma1 jyotira1tma1 va1sudevo vimukta Om3”. (I
<>am Brahma1, the light, the Spirit, Va1sudeva, and Vimukta
<>(having no connection with anything), OM). (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 374).
<HI>D2IBHAKA. A prince who, puffed up by the power of
<>boons and blessings from the gods, tried to harm sage
<>Durva1sas. Balabhadrara1ma killed him. The following
<>account occurs in the Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a.
<NI>Brahmadatta, King of Sa1lva, had two wives. No chil-
<>dren were born to them for several years. Brahmadatta's
<>minister, Mitrasaha, also had no children. Mitrasaha
<>was a brahmin and a scholar. On his advice, Brahma-
<>datta, with his wives, went to Kaila1sa and performed
<>tapas to please S4iva to get children. As a result of ten
<>years’ rigorous tapas S4iva was pleased and blessed
<>him that two sons would be born to him. Later his
<>wives gave birth to two sons. The son of the eldest
<>queen was named Ham3sa and that of the second queen
<>was named D2ibhaka. At this time a son was also born
<>to Mitrasaha, the minister by the blessing of Vis2n2u. That
<>child was named Jana1rdana.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka were spoilt, but Jana1rdana was
<>a bhakta of Vis2n2u. Ham3sa and D2ibhaka performed
<>tapas in their childhood to please S4iva and got invinci-
<>ble power and arrows. After that they became loka-
<>kan2t2akas (torturers) and went round the world. Once
<>they went to Kas4yapa's a1s4rama and destroyed the place
<>of worship. After that they went to the a1s4rama of
<>Durva1sas. There they tortured the sages and made the
<>sages naked who were wearing only loin cloth. Then
<>they returned.
<NI>Enraged by these, sage Durva1sas went to Dva1raka1
<>taking the destroyed loin-cloth and other articles. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and his courtiers stood up and saluted him when
<>they saw Durva1sas coming like sam3ha1rarudra. On
<>hearing the news, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a assured him that he would
<>kill Ham3sa and D2ibhaka and sent him back pacified.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka began a ra1jasu1ya. They sent
<>Jana1rdana to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a with the message that he should [Page241-b+ 63]
<>either fight with them or give them tribute (in the
<>form of money). Jana1rdana went to Dva1raka1, just as
<>Akru1ra, a devotee of Vis2n2u, went to Amba1d2i with the
<>message of Kam3sa. Immediately Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra
<>with the chief Ministers like Sa1tyaki went to Sa1lva. In
<>the war that followed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Ham3sa and Bala.
<>Bhadrara1ma killed D2ibhaka. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva,

<HI>DI1KS2A1. Di1ks2a1 is the vrata that expels sin and increases
<>Jn5a1na (wisdom). Those who are to be blessed fall into
<>three categories. The person who belongs to the first
<>category is called Vijn5a1nakala; the second is Pralaya-
<>kala; and the third is Sakala. Vijn5a1nakala is free from
<>sin alone. Pralayakala is free from sins and Karmans.
<>Sakala has everything from Kala1 to the earth. The
<>Di1ks2a1s to be practised by the three classes of persons
<>are of different kinds. Di1ks2a1 is classified into two:
<>“Nira1dha1ra and Sa1dha1ra.
<NI>Nira1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is performed for the sake of Vijn5a1na-
<>kala and Pralayakala. Sa1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is prescribed for
<>the third class of people, the Sakalas.
<HI>DILI1PA I. (Khat2va1n3ga). A mighty king of the Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See Das4aratha's Genealogy.
<NI>2) {%Reign and Birth of Son.%} Dili1pa is counted as one of the
<>noblest kings. His reign was extremely popular. But
<>even after a long period of married life, he had no
<>issue. His queen was Sudaks2in2a1, the princess of Maga-
<>dha. In order to get Vasis2t2ha's advice, Dili1pa and
<>Sudaks2in2a1 went to the sage's a1s4rama. After hearing
<>about their grievance, Vasis2t2ha meditated for a little
<>while and described why the royal couple were not
<>blessed with children:--“Long ago, Dili1pa had paid
<>a visit to Indra. While returning after the visit, he
<>passed by Ka1madhenu who was lying under the shade of
<>Kalpavr2ks2a. He paid no heed to her, as he did not
<>see her. The divine cow (Ka1madhenu) took this as
<>a personal slight to her and cursed the King that he
<>would not have children until he served and propitiat-
<>ed her daughter, Nandini1. Neither the King nor his
<>charioteer was aware of the curse. Ka1madhenu has
<>now gone to Pa1ta1la (underworld) to attend a sacrifice
<>of Varun2a. Therefore Dili1pa and his queen should
<>attend on and propitiate her daughter, Nandini1.”
<NI>From the next morning the King and queen began to
<>offer their services to Nandini1. The King followed her
<>as her shadow. After twentyone days, one morning
<>Nandini1 went to graze in a dense forest. As usual, the
<>King also followed her. As they reached the middle
<>of the woods, the King was enchanted for a moment
<>by the charm of the Sylvan scenery. Just then, on
<>turning round he saw a lion springing towards Nandini1
<>to prey upon her. Suddenly he took up his bow and
<>aimed an arrow at the lion, but to his great amaze-
<>ment, his hands were paralysed. The lion spoke to him
<>as follows:--“O King, you need not exert yourself in
<>vain. I am the servant of Lord S4iva. This holy deodar [Page242-a+ 64]
<>tree which you see in front of us, was planted and
<>tended by Pa1rvati1. My task is to protect this tree.
<>Pa1rvati1 and lord S4iva have authorized me to kill and
<>eat the animals which come this way. Therefore this
<>cow is my food.”
<NI>The king was in a fix. He begged the lion to spare
<>Nandini1 and to eat his (king's) body instead. The
<>lion agreed. The King put down his arms and stood
<>bowing down in front of the lion. Hearing the words,
<>“Beloved child, arise” he looked up, and the lion had
<>vanished. Just then Nandini1 told him that it was she
<>herself who had done this to test him. The King and

<>Vis2n2u advised Vais4ravan2a to seek the help of Dili1pa.
<>Dili1pa went to Alaka1puri1 and encountered Vi1rasena.
<>Under the shower of arrows fram Dili1pa, blood began

<HI>D2IM3D2IKA. A rat who played a part in Bid2a1lopa1khya1na.
<>The story runs as follows:
<NI>Once a cat performed tapas, holding his hands up, on
<>the banks of the Ganges, when the found no way to get
<>food. Seeing the devotion of that cat all living beings
<>birds and animals began to worship him. Once the cat
<>called all rats and told them: “One cannot do spiritual
<>and physical deeds at the same time. So I will look after
<>your spiritual affairs. You should attend to my
<>physical needs. That is, bring me food, bathe me in
<>the Ganges, all these are your duties.”
<NI>The rats agreed to do so. They took him to the
<>Ganges, bathed him and gave him food. But, the cat,
<>whenever he got a chance caught a rat and ate it up
<>The cat's health improved day-by-day and the number
<>of rat's began to decrease. Among them, there was a
<>clever rat named D2imd2ika. He called all the other rats [Page242-b+ 65]
<>and organized a secret conference. The subject of
<>discussion was the cruel deeds done by the cat to the
<>rats.
<NI>The next day D2im3d2ika went secretly to examine the
<>ways of living of the cat. The cat ate D2im3d2ika. After
<>40 days the rats came to know that D2im3d2ika was
<>missing. They assembled secretly. They elected a rat
<>named Kokila as their leader. Under his leadership
<>the rats declared independence and left the place. The
<>cat also went his own way finding no means to get food.

<HI>DI1NANA1THA. A King who lived in Dva1para Age. He
<>was a mighty and famous Vais2n2ava. But his childless
<>life distressed him very much. Once he consulted
<>Ga1lava about his plight. Ga1lava assured him that if he
<>performed a human sacrifice, a son would be born to
<>him. A handsome, scholarly and highly-born man was
<>to be sacrificed into the fire, A cripple, a dark-skinned
<>man or a crude fellow was unsuitable for the purpose.
<>The King's servants scoured the villages and towns
<>looking for such a perfect man, but in vain. At last
<>they reached a country called Das4apura, inhabited by
<>noble Bra1hman2as. The women of that place were
<>reputed for their charming eyes. No man could resist
<>their fascination. In that lovely city there lived a
<>Bra1hman2a named Kr2s2n2adeva with his virtuous wife and
<>three sons. The King's servants requested Kr2s2n2adeva
<>to give one of his sons to be sacrificed. They offered
<>four lakhs of gold coins as price. The Bra1hman2a and
<>his wife cried bitterly and Kr2s2n2adeva offered himself
<>instead of his sons. The royal servants seized one of his
<>sons after throwing gold coins in the house and
<>prepared to take him away. At this stage the second
<>son of Kr2s2n2adeva came forward and volunteered
<>himself. They agreed and he accompanied them to the
<>palace. On their way they met the sage Vis4va1mitra.
<>He asked them to release the boy but they refused to
<>set him free. The sage followed them to the palace and
<>undertook to perform a sacrifice which would bless the
<>King with progeny without a human sacrifice. The
<>King accepted the offer and thus the boy was saved.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 12).
<HI>DI1PAKARN2I. A character in Gun2a1d2hya's Br2hatkatha1.
<>Di1pakarn2i was a King. He had a wife named
<>S4aktimati1. One day while she was sleeping in the gar-
<>den she was bitten by a snake and she died. Distressed
<>by her departure, Di1pakarn2i accepted Brahmacarya.
<>He was deeply grieved because he had no son to
<>succeed to his throne. One day S4iva appeared to him
<>in a dream and told him thus:--“When you pass
<>through the forest, you will come across a youth riding
<>a lion. Take him to your palace; he will be your son.”
<NI>Di1pakarn2i woke up happily. He had faith in his dream.
<>One day he went to a distant forest for hunting.
<>There he saw a very handsome boy riding on a lion.
<>He was reminded of his dream when the boy dismounted [Page243-a+ 62]
<>and the lion walked away slowly to a nearby stream to
<>drink water. At once Di1pakarn2i shot an arrow at the
<>lion. Suddenly the lion gave up its animal shape and
<>transformed itself into a man and spoke to the King as
<>follows:--
<NI>I am a Yaks2a named Sa1ta and a friend of Vais4ravan2a.
<>Once when I went to bathe in the river Gan3ga1, I
<>happened to see a R2s2i virgin and I fell in love with her.
<>I married her according to the Ga1ndharva rules. The
<>R2s2is who came to know of it turned us into a lion
<>couple by their curse. When we fell at their feet and
<>begged pardon, they gave her a blessing that a son
<>would be born to her and that I would fall under your
<>arrow. After that we were wandering about as a
<>lion-couple and in due course she became pregnant.
<>In the fullness of time she gave birth to this boy and
<>then was liberated from the curse. I have been bringing
<>him up by giving the milk of lionesses. Now, by being
<>hit by your arrow, I am also released from the curse.
<>From this time kindly receive this mighty youth as
<>your own.”
<NI>After saying this, the Yaks2a vanished. Di1pakarn2i
<>returned to the palace, taking the boy with him. Since
<>he was carried by Sa1ta, the boy was named “Sa1tava1-
<>hana”. When he grew up into a youth, Di1pakarn2i
<>handed over the rule of the kingdom to him and
<>entered into Va1naprastha. In course of time Sa1tava1hana
<>became an emperor. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha

<HI>DI1RGHATAMAS. A great Muni.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} An3giras, the son of Brahma1, had two sons,
<>Utathya and Br2haspati. One day when Utathya was
<>away from home, Br2haspati approached his elder
<>brother's wife, Mamata1, who was pregnant at the time,
<>and tried to have sexual union with her. But she tried
<>to dissuade him and said--“The child in my womb,
<>born from Utathya's semen has already mastered
<>Vedas and Veda1m3gas. Your semen is also equally
<>powerful. How can my womb bear the combined force
<>of the two semens? So please refrain from this attempt
<>of yours.” But even after hearing these words of his
<>sister-in-law, Br2haspati was not able to control his
<>passions. At the time of the intercourse, when the
<>semen of Br2haspati entered the womb, the child within
<>it cried out--“Father ! this passion is improper. Two
<>persons have no place here. So withdraw your semen.”
<>Br2haspati did not heed the request. The child in the
<>womb repelled the semen that entered the womb with
<>his foot and it dropped on the floor. Br2haspati who
<>became angry, cursed the child. As a result, the boy
<>was born blind. He got the name “Di1rghatamas”
<>because he was born blind. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 104).
<NI>2) {%Family Life.%} In brilliance of parts, Di1rghatamas
<F>1. The story of Brhaspati's union with Mamata1 is given in Bha1gavata Pura1n2a. According to this story the child in her womb was
<>Bharadva1ja. The Maha1bha1rata states that the child born to Mamata1 was Di1rghatamas.</F>
<>equalled Br2haspati. Di1rghatamas, who was born blind,
<>married Pradves2i, a Bra1hman2i1. The couple had many
<>children, chief of whom was Gautama. But after the
<>birth of the children, Di1rghatmas fell into evil ways
<>and became an object of hatred and contempt. The
<>inmates of a1s4ramas dubbed him a sinner. His wife, was
<>disgusted with him. One day, the enraged Di1rgha-
<>tamas, in his fury cursed women as a whole and
<>Pradves2i1 could not control her anger. She, with the
<>help of Gautama and other sons made a raft and
<>placing Di1rghatamas on it, floated it down the river
<>Gan3ga1. The King Bali happened to see the raft float-
<>ing down the river. He sent men to bring the boat to
<>the bank. The King recognized Di1rghatamas and
<>asked the Muni to beget brilliant and intelligent
<>children by his queen. Di1rghatamas agreed and the
<>King sent the queen Sudes2n2a1 to him. The queen who
<>did not find pleasure in the company of the blind and
<>decrepit Muni sent a nurse to him. The nurse bore to
<>him Kaks2i1va1n and ten other sons all of whom became
<>great scholars. After some years the King came to know
<>that the mother of those boys was the nurse. Then he
<>sent Sudes2n2a1 again to the Muni. Di1rghatamas, after
<>touching her body blessed her and five sons, An3ga, [Page244-a+ 65]
<>Van3ga, Kalin3ga, Pun2d2ra and S4un3ga were born to her.
<>They founded five Kingdoms which were known by
<>their names respectively. They are known by their
<>modern names: Bha1galpura, Benga1l, A1ndhra, Ra1ja-
<>sa1hi and Ta1mravika.

<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30, verse 2).
<HI>DI1RGHA1YUS. Brother of S4ruta1yus, the King of Kalin3ga.
<>Arjuna killed him in the war. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Verse 29).
<HI>DI1RGHIKA1 A daughter of Vis4vakarman. She was
<>abnormally tall, and since there was the S4a1stric injun-
<>ction that he who married such women would die
<>within six months none came forward to wed her.
<NI>Di1rghika1 began a penance for a good husband. As it
<>continued for years together symptoms of old age began
<>to appear in her. At this juncture an old and ailing
<>householder came there. On certain conditions he
<>married Di1rghika1. After sometime, in obedience to the
<>husband's wisn Di1rghika1 set out on a tour carrying him
<>on her shoulders. Though Ma1n2d2avya cursed her hus-
<>band on their way, due to the chastity of Di1rghika1 the
<>curse proved to be ineffective. The similarity in the
<>stories of S4a1n2d2ili1 and this Di1rghika1 leads us to think
<>that they might have been one and the same person.
<HI>DIS4A1CAKS2U. One of the prominent off-springs of
<>Garud2a. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 10).
<HI>DITI.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A daughter of Daks2a Praja1pati. She was
<>married to Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci. She had many sisters, chief among whom were
<>Aditi, Ka1la1, Dana1yus, Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pr2tha1,
<>Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1, Muni and Kadru1. Kas4yapa's
<>sons by Aditi became Devas (A1diteyas) and his sons
<>by Diti became Asuras (Daityas). (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65).
<NI>2) {%Indra cut Diti's embryo to pieces.%} Devas and Asuras
<>agreed to churn the ocean of milk as a joint endeavour.
<>But when Amr2ta rose up to the surface, they began to
<>quarrel over it. In the battle between Devas and
<>Asuras for the possession of Amr2ta, Diti's sons were
<>killed.
<NI>In her inconsolable grief at the death of her sons, Diti
<>prayed to her husband Kas4yapa that she should be
<>blessed with a brave and heroic son who would be
<>capable of killing Indra. The sage granted her the
<>boon and told her that by worshipping the lord with a
<>pure mind and body for a hundred years, she would
<>bear a son who would be mighty enough to kill Indra.
<>In due course Diti became pregnant and following her
<>husband's advice, she fervently worshipped the Lord
<>and remained pure in mind and body. When Indra
<>came to know that the child in Diti's womb was to be
<>his slayer, he approached her under the disguise of an
<>attendant, offering to serve her. He waited for an [Page244-b+ 65]
<>opportunity to get access to her and before the expiry
<>of a hundred years he got a chance. One day, Diti
<>went to bed without washing her feet and fell asleep.
<>Indra took his Vajra and gaining access to her womb
<>cut the embryo within it into seven pieces. The child
<>in the womb began to cry loudly. Indra asked it
<>“MA1 RUDA” (Do not cry). Then he proceeded to
<>cut each of the seven pieces again into seven and
<>finally there were fortynine pieces in all. They subse-
<>quently became Devas known as “Maruts.” They got
<>the name Maruts because Indra told them “Ma1 Ruda.”
<>All the fortynine Maruts later on became the helpers
<>of Indra. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 21).
<NI>3) {%Diti's sons.%} Asuras were Diti's sons. Chief among
<>them were Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. They had
<>a sister named Sim3hika1. Hiran2yakas4ipu had four
<>sons--Anuhla1da, Hla1da, Prahla1da and Sam3hla1da who
<>were famous for their glory and might. S4u1rapadma,
<>Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura, Gomukha and Aja1mukha
<>were also Diti's sons. Of them, S4u1rapadma had four
<>sons by his wife Mayasuta1, who were Bha1nukopa,
<>Agnimukha, Vajraba1hu and Hiran2ya. An asura named
<>Maha1s4u1ra was born to Sim3havaktra by his wife,
<>Vibhu1ti. The Asuras, S4ambara, S4akuni, Dvimu1rdha1,
<>S4an3ku, As4va, were the sons of Hiran2ya1ks2a. Sim3hika1
<>married Vipracitti; Ra1hu and Ketu were born to them.
<>Sam3hla1da, the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu had three sons,
<>A1yus2ma1n, S4ibi and Ba1s2kala. Virocana was the son of
<>Prahla1da; Maha1bali was the son of Virocana; Ba1n2a
<>was born to Maha1bali and to Ba1n2a were born four
<>crores of Niva1takavacas. All these were the prominent
<>children of Diti. Besides them, Diti had crores of other
<>Asuras born to her. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter
<>3; Harivam3s4a, Chapter 3).
<NI>4) {%Birth of Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a.%} Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>and Hiran2ya1ks2a were the rebirth of Jaya and Vijaya,
<>the two gate-keepers of Maha1vis2n2u. (See under Jaya).
<>There is a story as to how they were born as the sons
<>of Diti.
<NI>Diti was one of the wives of Kas4yapa. She had no
<>children while the other wives of Kas4yapa had children.
<>Jealousy and grief rankled in her mind. One day she
<>approached Kas4yapa and pressed him to beget a son
<>for her. It was the time of dusk when Kas4yapa was
<>deeply absorbed in his day's devotional worship. She
<>disturbed his “Dhya1na” (devotional concentration) by
<>her importunity, but he was reluctant to yield to her
<>wishes at such an inauspicious time. It is at dusk that
<>S4iva goes about with his attendant hordes of spirits,
<>wearing the crown of his matted hair covered with the
<>dust carried by the whirlwinds from cremation grounds
<>and keeping his three eyes wide open. Kas4yapa asked
<>Diti to wait for a few minutes, until that terrible time
<>was over, but she did not heed his advice. In the fury
<>of her passion she sprang towards him and stripped
<>him of his clothes and in the end Kas4yapa yielded to
<>her carnal desires. But after the act he in a repentant
<>mood told her that she had defiled her mind by having
<>sexual union in that unholy hour and by doing so had
<>sinned against the gods. As a result, twin sons will be
<>born in her womb. They would persecute and torture
<>the three worlds. Maha1vis2n2u would incarnate to
<>destroy them. But since she also felt a little regret in
<>her act, a grandson of her (Prahla1da) will become a
<>devotee of Vis2n2u. [Page245-a+ 65]
<>Twin sons, Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a were born
<>to Diti. For the rest of the story, see under Hiran2ya-
<>kas4pu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. (Bha1gavata, Prathama Skan-

<NI>2) {%Divoda1sa's Reign.%} When Divoda1sa began his rule in
<>Va1ra1n2asi1, there was a Ra1ks2asa named Ks2emaka.
<>Divoda1sa killed him and extended his kingdom. At
<>that stage, Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehayas invaded
<>Divoda1sa. Divoda1sa killed the hundred sons of Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya. At that time the sage Kum3bhaka (Nikumbha)
<>came to Ka1s4i1. His practice was to live fora thousand
<>years at any place where he reached at the time of
<>dusk. Since he had reached Va1ra1n2asi1 at dusk, he set up
<>an a1s4rama and lived there for a thousand years. At
<>that time there was a famine in Va1ra1n2asi1. The whole
<>land was in the grip of a severe drought. Kumbhaka's
<>a1s4rama and its surroundings alone remained green and
<>cool. Herdsmen used to take cattle to graze in the
<>neighbourhood of the a1s4rama. Once when they retur-
<>ned in the evening, they took with their cows, the
<>sacrificial cow of Kumbhaka. It was dark and the sage
<>searched for the cow everywhere but could not trace
<>its whereabouts At last he came to know by intuition
<>that his cow was taken away by the herdsmen. In his
<>rage he cursed that Va1ra1n2asi1 should be ruined and left
<>the place with his disciples. (See under Kumbhaka).
<NI>The story of the ruin of Va1ra1n2asi1 in Harivam3sa is diff-
<>erent. It was the time when S4iva had married Pa1rvati1,
<>the daughter of Himava1n. After marriage S4iva shifted
<>his residence to his wife's house. S4iva whose task was
<>to look after the affairs of the world, was never availa-
<>ble for the purpose at Kaila1sa, his own seat.
<>The gods were in a helpless condition. They ap-
<>proached Pa1rvati1's mother, Mena1 and requested her [Page245-b+ 65]
<>to persuade S4iva to return to his own place by any
<>means. Mena1 called her daughter and ridiculed her
<>husband as a vagabond who had no place to lay his
<>head on. Pa1rvati1 could not bear this insult. Her mother's
<>stinging remarks got circulation in Devaloka. So she
<>urged S4iva to settle down somewhere on earth with her.
<>S4iva agreed and promised to take up residence at
<>Ka1s4i1.
<NI>The ruler of Ka1s4i1 in those days was Divoda1sa. It was
<>a prosperous period in the country. As a rule, man
<>turns to God only when faced with misfortunes. So
<>S4iva decided to bring about a famine among the people
<>of the country by ruining it. For that he sent sage
<>Kumbhaka to Va1ra1n2asi1. Kumbhaka arrived in Ka1s4i1
<>and appeared to the barber Karn2aka to whom he
<>communicated S4iva's intentions. The barber cheerfully
<>fell in with the proposal and built a temple on the
<>next day for the residence of Kumbhaka. Living in
<>the temple, Kumbhaka began to participate in the
<>spiritual matters of the people. His blessings were much
<>sought after and people came to have deep faith in
<>him.
<NI>Divoda1sa had no children. He had made many pious
<>offerings to gods and performed many holy rites for
<>removing his wife's sterility, but it was all in vain.
<>At last, at the King's suggestion, she began to offer
<>pu1ja1 to Kumbhaka praying for issue. But even after
<>a long period of devoted worship, she received no
<>blessing or boon from the sage. Moved by the pathetic
<>condition of his queen, Suyas4as, Divoda1sa reproached
<>Kumbhaka very severely. He reprimanded him for
<>denying his blessings to the queen while he was shower-
<>ing them on all and sundry in the country. Provoked
<>at the King's rebuke, Kumbhaka pronounced a curse
<>that the country should be ruined. As a result of it the
<>country began to decline. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter 29).
<NI>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 came and settled down in Va1ra1n2asi1.
<>After some years, Pa1rvati1 began to press her husband
<>to leave the place and to go somewhere else. S4iva was
<>not inclined to do so. He said the place was “Avimu-
<>kta” and therefore insisted that he would not leave
<>it. From that time the place came to be called
<>“Avimukta.”
<NI>3) Other details.
<NI>(1) Towards the end of his life Divoda1sa became a
<>Ra1jars2i (Royal Saint). There are numerous references
<>to this Ra1jars2i in the R2gveda. Since Divoda1sa was of
<>a very hospitable nature he was known by another
<>name, “Atithigva”. In R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 16th
<>Anuva1ka, 127th Su1kta, we read that once he hid him-
<>self under water to escape from an Asura called
<>S4am3bara.
<NI>(2) Divoda1sa had a son named “Parucchepa”, who
<>was a R2s2i. R2gveda 1st Man2d2ala 19th Anuva1ka, 127th
<>Su1kta relates to Parucchepa.
<NI>(3) Bhi1maratha, the father of Divoda1sa, had two other
<>names, Bhi1masena, and Sudeva. Divoda1sa purchased
<>Ma1dhavi1, the daughter of Yaya1ti after paying two
<>hundred S4ya1makarn2a1s4vas (beautiful horses with dark-
<>coloured ears) to Ga1lava, so that he might have chil-
<>dren. After the birth of his children, he returned
<>Ma1dhavi1 to her father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>117).
<NI>(4) He sits in Yama's assembly and offers Pu1ja1 to
<>Yama. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 12). [Page246-a+ 65]
<NI>(5) Divoda1sa once plundered the accessories of his
<>enemies. Agnihotra vanished after it. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 21).
<NI>(6) It was at the behest of Indra that Divoda1sa built
<>the city of Va1ran2asi1 (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>30, Verse 16).
<NI>(7) Once Divoda1sa fought with the King of Hehaya
<>for one thousand days. After having lost his army he went
<>to the sage Bharadva1ja and performed Putraka1mes2t2i
<>sacrifice. As a result of it a son Pratardana was born
<>to him. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>(8) Other names for Divoda1sa used in the Maha1bha1-
<>rata are--Bhaimaseni, Ka1s4i1s4a, Saudeva, Sudevatanaya
<>etc.
<NI>DIVYA1DEVI1. Daughter of Divoda1sa, King of Plaks2a-
<>dvi1pa. There is a story about this princess in Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapters 85, 88.
<NI>Divoda1sa decided to give his daughter Divya1 in
<>marriage to Citrasena, King of Ru1pades4a. But just
<>before the day fixed for the marriage Citrasena died
<>prematurely. So, as advised by the Bra1hman2as who had
<>come there she was married to Ru1pasena. He also died
<>soon after. She was subsequently married to 21 persons
<>in turn, and all of them died one by one.
<NI>Everyone took pity on her for her ill-fate. At last, at the
<>suggestion of the ministers, preparations were made for
<>her svayam3vara. Here also ill-luck pursued her. All
<>the princes who arrived to take part in the svayam3vara
<>killed each other in mutual fight. Depressed and embit-
<>tered by all this, Divya1 decided torenounce all worldly
<>pleasures and proceeded to the forest.
<NI>Once S4uka named Ujjvala came to Plaks2advi1pa.
<>Moved to pity at the grief-stricken Divya1 he taught her
<>“As4u1nyas4ayana” vrata. When she practised this vrata
<>with devotion for about four years, Maha1vis2n2u appeared
<>before her and took her with him to Vis2n2uloka.
<HI>DIVYAKAT2AM. A city situated in Western India in
<>ancient times. According to Maha1bha1rata this city was
<>conquered by Nakula.--Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 32.
<HI>DIVYAKARMAKR2T. A Vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 91, Verse 35).
<HI>DIVYASA1NU. A Vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 91, Verse 30).
<HI>DIVYAVARS2A(M). 365 days make one year for hu-
<>man beings. One year for human beings is one day for
<>the gods. 365 such days of the gods make one year for
<>the gods. This means that 365 years for human beings
<>are equal to one year for the gods. The year for the
<>gods is known as “Divyavarsa” or “Divyavatsara”.
<>Kr2tayuga is made up of 4,800 Divyavatsaras. Treta1yu-
<>uga has 3,600 Divyavatsaras. 2,400 Divyavatsaras make
<>up one Dva1parayuga. Kaliyuga has 1,200 Divyavatsaras.
<>12,000 Divyavars2as of this kind make up one “catur-
<>yuga”. 71 Caturyugas are the period of one Manu.
<>After the end of the period of one Manu, the gods
<>complete their term of existence. The total period of
<>14 Manus is called a Kalpa. At the end of every
<>Kalpa there is a deluge. One Kalpa is one day time
<>for Brahma1. After the deluge, until the time of one
<>Kalpa, is Brahma1's night. There is no universe at that
<>time. At the end of that Kalpa, the next Kalpa
<>begins and Brahma1 starts his work of creation.
<>In this way when 360 days and nights of Brahma1
<>are completed, it is one Brahma1 Vars2a. One Brahma1
<>life-span is 120 such years. After that there is nothing [Page246-b+ 64]
<>for a Brahma1's life-span. Then Brahma1 is re-born and
<>resumes creation. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama Skandha).
<HI>DRAUPADI1. Pa1n5ca1li1, the wife of the Pa1n2d2avas. (See
<>under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<HI>DRAUPADI1HARAN2A PARVA. A sub section of Vana
<>Parva in the Maha1bha1rata. This covers Chapters 262
<>to 271 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAUPADI1SATYABHA1MA1SAM3VA1DA PARVA. A
<>sub section of Vana Parva, in the Maha1bha1rata. This
<>comprises Chapters 233 to 235 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAVID2A I. A King of the family of Priyavrata who
<>was the son of Manu. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<HI>DRAVID2A II. A gandharva who was the father of
<>Kam3sa. (See under Kam3sa) Am3s4umati1 was the daugh-
<>ter of this gandharva. (See under Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DRAVID2A(M). (DRA1VID2A). In ancient days the
<>whole of South India was known by the name Tami-
<>laka, as Tamil was the language used throughout South
<>India. Strictly speaking, all the languages used in
<>South India were given the name Tamil. The word
<>‘Tamil’ underwent changes in the language of North
<>India and took the form ‘Dra1vida’. Etymologists are
<>of opinion that the changes that took place in the word
<>Tamil were are follows:- Tamil--Damil--Damid2-
<>-Dramid2--Dravid2--Dra1vid2. Reference to the
<>Dra1vid2a country occurs in most of the Pura1n2as.
<>Maha1bha1rata states that Sahadeva, one of the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas, sent a note for collecting taxes from the people of
<>Dra1vida. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 71.
<NI>“There are other countries also in the southern Bha1rata
<>such as Dravida, Kerala, Pra1cya, Mu1s2i1ka, Vanava1si1ka
<>Karn2a1t2aka, Mahis2aka, Vikalpa and Mu1s2aka.” This
<>statement (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9) throws
<>light on the various countries which existed in South
<>India at the time of Maha1bha1rata. In Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10, it is mentioned that Kam3sa, the uncle of
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, was the son of Dramila, a gandharva. (See
<>under Kam3sa).
<HI>DRA1VIDAS. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 22) that the dra1vidas were
<>originally Ks2atriyas and that they became S4u1dras by
<>the curse of Bra1hman2as.
<HI>DRA1VID2A BHA1S2A1. (Dravidian Language). Linguists
<>have classified the languages of the world under certain
<>groups. Important among them are the Indo-European
<>group, the semitic group, the Hamitic group, the Ural
<>Altaic group, the South East Asiatic group, the Dravi-
<>dian group, Austric group, the Bantu group and the
<>Chinese group.
<NI>Almost all the languages in South India belong to the
<>Dravidian group. The languages of this group are
<>Tamil, Telugu, Kannad2a, Malaya1lam, Tulu, Kut2aku,
<>Tot2a, Kot2a, Bad2aka, Kuruk and Bra1hu1i1. Of these
<>Bra1hu1i1 alone is used in the mountain regions of Balu-
<>cisthan. Linguists like Smi1mud and others have stated
<>that there is a close relation between the Australian and
<>Dravidian languages. The A1ryan language has influence-
<>ed the Dravidian languages to a great extent. But Tamil
<>has not been so much influenced as Telugu, Kannad2a
<>and Malaya1lam. It is because Tamil had a great wealth
<>of literature of its own from ancient times.
<>The Dravidian group is again divided into four sections:
<>Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern. Bra1hu1i1
<>is the only language in the Northern section. Its Ety- [Page247-a+ 64]
<>mology, grammar etc. are like that of the Dravidian
<>group. But it had been influenced to a large extent by
<>the Iranian language. Still it keeps its Dravidian cha-
<>racter.
<NI>Telugu, Gon2d2i, Kuruk, Kola1mi, Ma1lt2a etc. come under
<>the Eastern group. Of these only Telugu has grown as
<>a literary language. Telugu is in use from Madras to
<>Mahendragiri. But it has various sub-divisions and local
<>differences. The Telugu used in the Districts of Kr2s2n2a1
<>and Goda1vari1 is considered to be the purest form.
<>Golari, Sa1leva1ri, Ka1ma1ri, Va1sari, Da1sari etc. are its local
<>sub-divisions. Over modern Telugu, Sanskrit has its
<>full sway.
<NI>Kannad2a, Kut2aku, Tot2a, Kod2a, etc. come under the
<>western group. Kannad2a is used in Mysore and the
<>vicinity of the Districts of Coimbatore, Salem, Bellary,
<>Anantapore etc. Bad2aka used in the Nilgiris, Kurumpa,
<>used in the vicinity of Nilgiris, Kut2aku used in
<>Coorg, are the sub divisions of Kannad2a. In edicts from
<>the 5th century Kannad2a could be seen in its ancient
<>form. The modern Kannad2a has been used from 16th
<>century onwards. Tulu is in use in places between the
<>rivers Candragiri in the south of. Southern Canara and
<>Kalya1n2apuri1. Only a few ancient songs could be includ-
<>ed in Tulu literature. The Malaya1lam script is used
<>to write Tulu. But now certain books in Tulu have
<>been published using Kannad2a script.
<NI>Tamil and Malaya1lam are the languages of the Sou-
<>thern section. The oldest literature in the Dravidian
<>group is in Tamil. The most ancient form of Tamil
<>is seen in the edicts and stone tables of the 30th century
<>B.C. The most important among them are the San3ga
<>works. The grammatical work ‘Tolka1ppiyam, is the
<>literary grammar of Centamil. Malaya1lam became an
<>independent language only by the 8th century A.D. The
<>close relation that exists between Tamil and Malaya1lam
<>is not visible in any other language of the Dravidian
<>group. By examining the inter-relations of the various
<>languages in the Dravidian group, and noting
<>how close or distant the relation is, we can ascertain
<>which languages separated themselves first from the
<>original Dravida language.
<HI>DRAVIN2ASA. A Pracetas. (One of the ten sons of the
<>Pra1ci1na Barhis). (Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>DRAVIRATHA. A King of the family of An3ga. He was
<>the son of Dadhiva1hana and the father of Dharmaratha
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 277).
<HI>DRAVYAS4UDDHI. Purifying impure things, The
<>mode of purification of impure things, in ancient
<>India, was known as dravyas4uddhi. The procedure of
<>purification was as follows:
<NI>If earthern-wares became impure by coming into con-
<>tact with urine or excreta, they should be burnt in fire.
<>Golden or copper vessels may be remoulded or filled
<>with or dipped in tamarind water. Things made of
<>iron or bronze may be washed in ash-water. Things
<>made of glass or pearl need only be washed in pure
<>water. Things born in water such as lotus etc. could
<>be purified by dipping them in water. If cloth is made
<>impure rub it with soil and dip it in water. If it is a
<>large quantity of cloth, a mixture of soil and water may
<>be sprinkled on it. Wooden things will become pure
<>by planing. Cot, chair, fan, cart etc. need only be
<>washed. Pots used for cooking meat may be touched [Page247-b+ 64]
<>with cow's milk. Things made of ivory may be washed
<>in mustard-water. Jaggery, salt etc. need only be dried.

<>Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 238).
<HI>DRON2A I. The teacher in archery of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>the Kauravas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Dron2a was the son of Bharadva1ja who had his
<>hermitage erected on the bank of the Ganges. Once
<>Bharadva1ja went to bathe in the river. When he got
<>into the river he saw the celestial maid Ghr2ta1ci1. The cele-
<>stial maid ran away as soon as she saw the hermit. But
<>her cloth was caught in grass and slipped off her body.
<>When the hermit saw the complete form of her body
<>which was bright and beautiful, he had seminal discharge.
<>The discharged semen was kept in a Dron2a (trough).
<>A child was born from that and he was named
<>Dron2a, who was brought up in the hermitage. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 13).
<NI>2) {%Education and Marriage.%} Dron2a learned the art of
<>using weapons from his father and the hermit Agnives4a.
<>Drupada the prince of Pa1n5ca1la was the fellow student
<>of Dron2a. They became great friends. On completion
<>of education Drupada returned to Pa1n5ca1la. Dron2a
<>married Kr2pi1 the daughter of S4aradva1n. A son was born
<>to them. At his birth the child neighed like the horse
<>Uccaih2s4ravas; so his parents named him As4vattha1ma1.
<>Hearing that Paras ura1ma was giving Bra1hman2as free
<>gift of wealth and property, Dron2a reached there.
<>Dron2a's desire was to get Dhanurveda (the art of
<>archery). Dron2a with his disciples went to Mahendra-
<>giri and saw Paras4ura1ma, who was about to enter forest
<>giving away everything he had. Paras4ura1ma said, “I
<>have given away to the Bra1hman2as gold and everything
<>I had. The land I had conquered is given to Kas4yapa.
<>Now there remains only my body and some weapons.
<>You can have one of them.”
<NI>Dron2a preferred the weapons. Thus Dron2a got the
<>entire armoury of Paras4ura1ma. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 13).
<NI>3) {%He became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas.%}
<>After receiving dhanurveda from Paras4ura1ma Dron2a
<>went to Pa1n5ca1la. Drupada who had been a fellow
<>student of Dron2a was the King of Uttarapan5ca1la. then.
<>Though Dron2a had become proficient in archery, he
<>was very poor.
<NI>He had no money even to buy milk for his child. Once
<>the playmates of As4vattha1ma1 made him drink a mix-
<>ture of water and flour saying that it was milk. So
<>Dron2a approached Drupada for financial help. But
<>Drupada shunned his fellow student, scolded him and
<>sent him away without giving any help. Dron2a vowed
<>that he would, somehow or other, take revenge upon
<>Drupada and departed from Pa1n5ca1la.
<NI>The aim of Dron2a was to get some capable disciples. He
<>reached Hastina1pura and stayed in disguise with Gautama
<>for a while. Once the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas who
<>were boys were engaged in the game of Ka1ra (a kind
<>of cricket play) outside the palace premises. The ball
<>fell in a well by chance. The princess stood round the
<>well and began to ponder how to get the ‘ball’ out of
<>the well. They tried all means but in vain. At that
<>time a Bra1hman2a of dark complexion, short and aged,
<>came by that way. It was Dron2a. The boys gathered
<>round the old man. Dron2a threw his ring also into the
<F>1. To take revenge on Drupada was the thought that was uppermost in the mind of Dron2a.</F> [Page248-b+ 64]
<>well and said: “Your kingly qualities are very poor.
<>Your education in using weapons is not complete. If
<>you give me a meal I will get both the ring and the
<>ball together” The boys agreed to the conditions.
<>Dron2a took a grass and evoked arrow into it by mantra
<>(spell) and shot it at the ‘Ka1ra’. The next grass was
<>shot at the first grass. It struck the first grass. Thus he
<>shot grasses one after another till the grass reached the
<>brink of the well and by pulling the grass he took the ball
<>out. In the same way he took the ring also out of the
<>well. When they got the ‘Ka1ra’ the boys stood round
<>Dron2a and asked him what he would like as the reward
<>for his deed. Dron2a said that they need only tell Bhi1s2ma
<>how a short man of dark complexion took the ball out of
<>the well. Accordingly the boys went to Bhi1s2ma and
<>told him everything. Immediately Bhi1s2ma understood
<>that it was Dron2a. Bhi1s2ma thought that Dron2a was the
<>best person to teach the princes. So Dron2a was brought to
<>the palace and was engaged as the teacher in archery.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 130 and 131).
<NI>4) {%Education in Archery of the Kauravas and reward.%}
<NI>(a) {%First vow.%} Dron2a asked the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kau-
<>ravas to sit together and then told them. “There is one
<>thing that you should do for me when your education
<>is over”. Hearing this they all kept silent. But Arjuna
<>came forward and took the vow that he would achieve
<>that task according to the wish of the teacher.
<NI>{%(b) The disciple who is second to none.%} The training in
<>weapons commenced. Hearing of the fame of Dron2a,
<>disciples came from places far and near. Arjuna was
<>the first of all the students. Sending all the students to
<>fetch water Dron2a taught his son As4vattha1ma1 certain
<>special lessons. Arjuna secretly knew this. So he
<>brought water as quickly as possible before the others.
<>As Dron2a loved his brilliant student Arjuna, he taught
<>both his son and Arjuna alike the secrets. Seeing the
<>brilliance of Arjuna Dron2a ordered the cook not to seat
<>Arjuna in a dark place for meals. Yet it happened once
<>that the light was extinguished by wind while the prin-
<>ces were having their meals. All sat still, without eating,
<>while Arjuna alone ate his food. From this Arjuna
<>discovered that without seeing the object one could hit
<>the target by constant practice. Dron2a was greatly
<>pleased at this and embracing him promised to try to
<>make him such an expert that there would be none
<>equal to him in archery.
<NI>{%(c) Ekalavya.%} Once Arjuna and the other disciples went
<>to the forest for a hunt and there they met Ekalavya
<>who was superior to Arjuna in archery. This Ekalavya
<>had once approached Dron2a to learn archery from him.
<>But it was against the rule for a Brahmin to teach a
<>forester the art of fighting. So Ekalavya returned to the
<>forest and making an earthen image of Dron2a worshipp-
<>ed it and began self-learning in archery. Now he had
<>become superior to Arjuna in archery. The teacher
<>had said that none would be equal to Arjuna in archery.
<>Arjuna told Dron2a about Ekalavya. The teacher went
<>to the forest and got the thumb of Ekalavya as the
<>reward due to the teacher. Since then Ekalavya became
<>a great archer though only of a lower level than Arjuna
<>(See under Ekalavya).
<NI>{%d) Expert disciple.%} The education in archery and the
<>use of weapons was nearing completion. In archery
<>Arjuna was second to none. Duryodhana and Bhi1ma [Page249-a+ 65]
<>became expert club-men. As4vattha1ma1 was the first in
<>the secrets of archery. Nakula and Sahadeva became
<>expert swordsmen. Arjuna was expert in all branches of
<>weapon-training. Bhi1ma had bodily strength and Arjuna
<>had the strength of learning. Yudhis2t2hira was the fore-
<>most in chariot-fighting.
<NI>e) {%Artificial bird.%} Once Dron2a placed an artificial bird
<>on the branch of a tree without the knowledge of the
<>princes, to test their practice in archery. Then he
<>placed his disciples with their bows, around the tree,
<>and told them to shoot the bird down at his command.
<>Dron2a first called Dharmaputra and told him to look
<>at the bird. Then he asked him what he saw. Dharma-
<>putra said that he saw the bird, the tree, the teacher
<>and the students. He tested one by one. All gave the
<>same reply, that Dharmaputra gave. At last he asked
<>Arjuna. Arjuna stood for a while, taking aim and said
<>that he saw a bird only. The teacher commanded to
<>shoot and Arjuna sent an arrow. At the first shot the bird
<>fell down headless. With this test Dron2a understood that
<>Arjuna could defeat Drupada and embraced his
<>disciple.
<NI>{%(f) Dron2a caught by a crocodile.%} Once Dron2a and his
<>disciples went to bathe in the Ganges. While they were
<>dipping and splashing in the water a crocodile caught
<>Dron2a by the leg. Dron2a was unable to extricate
<>himself from the grip of the crocodile. So he asked his
<>disciples to shoot the crocodile and kill it. All stood
<>agape. Arjuna at once took bow and arrows and sent
<>five arrows one after another at the crocodile, which
<>died instantly and came afloat. The teacher, who
<>was much pleased, got out of the water and embraced
<>Arjuna and taught him ‘Brahma S4ira1stra’, a divine
<>weapon. After imparting this knowledge Dron2a told
<>Arjuna not to operate this weapon on man. But if an
<>enemy superior to man attacked him, then only, he
<>should send this missile at him to kill him.
<NI>Giving due respect to the advice of the teacher, Arjuna
<>received the Brahmas4ira1stra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 133).
<NI>g) {%Demonstration by the pupils.%} When the training of the prin-
<>ces terminated, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accorded sanction to hold a
<>demonstration of weapon-play, by the princes. An
<>arena was got ready. Dron2a entered the arena. As a
<>preliminary rite Dron2a worshipped the gods. Then he
<>invited Bra1hman2as to bless his pupils. After that the
<>pupils gave the teacher, gold, precious stones, cloths,
<>and other costly things. The princes paid homage to
<>to their teacher. The teacher gave his blessings to
<>them. With this the demonstration commenced.
<>Clubbing between Duryodhana and Bhi1ma was a
<>terrible one. But the mock fighting changed to a seri-
<>ous fight. Dron2a sent As4vattha1ma1 who separated them.
<>The audience applauded their performance. The per-
<>formance of Arjuna was of the most superior type and
<>the audience and the teacher were struck with wonder
<>at his extraordinary capability. Karn2a also showed
<>his performance. (For details see under Arjuna, Para 1
<>and Karn2a, Para 4). (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 133
<>and 134).
<NI>5) {%Revenge upon Drupada.%} When demonstration came to
<>an end it was the time for giving the teacher the gift
<>due to him. The teacher had, at the beginning, told
<>his pupils that on completion of the training they should
<>give him a gift. Accordingly he demanded that Drupada, [Page249-b+ 65]
<>the King of Pa1n5ca1la, should be brought before him with
<>his hands tied. As soon as Duryodhana and Karn2a heard
<>this they rapidly marched to Pa1n5ca1la and engaged
<>Drupada in a fight but were defeated by Drupada. After
<>that Arjuna entered the battle-field, defeated and tied
<>Drupada and brought him before Dron2a who was kind
<>enough not to kill Drupada. The Kingdom of Pa1n5ca1la
<>was divided into two. Drupada was given Uttara-Pa1n5-
<>ca1la and Dron2a took Daks2in2a Pa1n5ca1la. Then Drupada
<>was released. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 137).
<NI>6) {%Arjuna is accorded sanction to fight with his teacher.%} One
<>year after the revenge on Drupada Yudhis2t2hira was
<>anointed as heir-apparent, by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Once, in
<>the council of the king, Dron2a called Arjuna to him and
<>said: “Oh, Arjuna! you must take an oath to do a parti-
<>cular thing in the presence of your relatives. If it happens
<>that I oppose you in battle you should fight against me
<>without thinking that I am your teacher. This oath is
<>your gift to your teacher.” Arjuna agreed and took the
<>oath in the presence of the people. Because there was such
<>an oath Arjuna's conscience did not prick him when he
<>had to fight against his teacher Dron2a in the battle of
<>Bha1rata between the Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 139).
<NI>7) {%Part played by Dron2a up to the battle of Bha1rata.%}
<>(1) Duryodhana and his party came to know only at
<>the time of the svayam3vara (marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li1 that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas were not killed in the lac house burning.
<>When Arjuna won the test and got Pa1n5ca1li1, the Kaura-
<>vas became furious and began to plot against the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. At that time Dron2a came to the council-hall
<>of the Kauravas and said that the Kauravas should go
<>to Pa1n5ca1la and greet the Pa1n2d2avas, bring them back
<>and give them half of the kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 203).
<NI>(2) Dron2a was present at the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(imperial consecration) performed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza 8).
<NI>(3) When the game of dice was going on between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira Dron2a came with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>to the place to witness the game. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 60, Stanza 2).
<NI>(4) Dron2a declared that the game of dice between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira was not fair (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 2).
<NI>(5) Dron2a was well-versed in archery. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 4).
<NI>(6) While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the country of
<>Vira1t2a, Arjuna in the guise of Br2hannala, fought with the
<>Kauravas. Dron2a was the first to recognize Br2hannala
<>as Arjuna at the sound of his conch. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 24).
<NI>(7) In that fight Dron2a fought with Arjuna whose
<>arrows wounded Dron2a and he ran away from the
<>battlefield. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(8) When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to the council-hall of the
<>Kauravas to plead for a treaty on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>who had returned after forest life and pseudonymity,
<>Dron2a took the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and argued with
<>Duryodhana. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 126).
<NI>(9) Dron2a advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to see that a battle
<>between the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas was avoided.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, two Chapters from 138).
<NI>(10) When it was almost decided that the battle was
<>inevitable Dron2a boasted to Duryodhana that he would [Page250-a+ 62]
<>annihilate the army of the Pa1n2d2avas within a month.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 193, Stanza 18).
<NI>8) {%Why Dron2a whose leaning was towards the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>t2ook the side of the Kauravas in the battle of Bha1rata.%} At
<>heart Dron2a was on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas. But he
<>fought against them, taking the side of the Kauravas.
<>Even at that time he ardently wished the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>win the battle. What is the reason for it? An answer to
<>this question is found in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 43.
<NI>The battle was about to begin. Dharmaputra went to
<>Dron2a and bowed before him and requested to bless
<>him so that he might win the battle against the Kaura-
<>vas. Dron2a said, “It is good on your part to have
<>come and seen me before the battle is begun. If you
<>had not seen me I would have cursed you to lose the
<>battle. But today I am honoured since you have come.
<>You fight the battle. Victory is yours. But I have to
<>stand with the Kauravas, and there is a reason for it.
<>Man is a slave of money and money is not the slave
<>of Man. The Kauravas have tied me with money. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a will be on the side of the righteous. Where S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a is, there will be victory. But so long as I fight
<>it is difficult for you to win. So try to kill me at the
<>beginning of the battle. You need not feel sorry for
<>killing your teacher. Because when I shower arrows
<>and fight vehemently I won't look to see which enemy
<>has struck me down. Enemies could kill me only when
<>I am lying on darbha grass leaving fighting in dis-
<>appointment. I will put down my weapons in battle
<>only when I hear words which I dislike to hear.”
<NI>After having revealed these secrets of his own he sent
<>Yudhis2t2hira back. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 43).
<NI>9) {%Dron2a in the battle of Bha1rata.%} (1) On the first day

<NI>2) {%Education and kingship.%} Yajn5asena went to the hermi-
<>tage of Bharadva1ja for education. Dron2a, who became
<>a great teacher in archery later, was also a student and
<>disciple of Bharadva1ja at that time. Thus during the
<>time of education both Drupada and Dron2a became
<>fast friends. After receiving education Drupada re-
<>turned to his country. At that time Pa1n5ca1la was ruled
<>by Pr2s2ata. When Yajn5asena returned on completion of
<>his education, Pr2s2ata died and Yajn5asena was anointed
<>as King of Uttara-Pa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 129).
<NI>3) {%Yajn5asena reproaches Dron2a.%} It has already been said
<>that during the period of education Dron2a and Yajn5a-
<>sena were fast friends. Once Drupada said to Dron2a:
<>“My dear friend. My father has told me that I would
<>be made the King of Uttara Pa1n5ca1la on completing my
<>education. Thus if I become a King, the treasury of the
<>King will be at your disposal.”
<NI>After the education both returned to their places. Not
<>much later Dron2a got married. A son born to him was
<>named As4vattha1ma1. Dron2a was so poor that he could
<>not even buy milk for his child. Once the friends of
<>As4vattha1ma1 mixed flour in water and made him drink
<>it saying that it was milk. As4vattha1ma1 drank it without
<>knowing that it was not milk. Thinking that he had
<>become energetic by drinking milk he began to run
<>with the other boys. At last they told him the truth
<>and teased him.
<NI>With his wife and child Dron2a went to Drupada who
<>did not care to recognize him as a friend. Dron2a tried
<>to remind him of their former friendship. But Drupada
<>shunned him and said, “If I had friendship with you,
<>it was to achieve certain ends. There is no friendship
<>between the rich and the poor, the learned and the
<>illiterate, the brave and the coward. So if there was
<>any friendship at all it was not real. You, who are slow
<>of brain! Kings of high status cannot have friendship
<>with such people especially the poor. A Brahmin
<>learned in Vedas won't befriend a Brahmin who is not
<>learned in Vedas, a man seated in a chariot cannot
<>befriend a man who is not seated in a chariot and a
<>King cannot befriend one who is not a King. So a
<>friendship of bygone days is no friendship at all”.
<NI>Drupada's reproaches aroused a storm of anger in
<>Dron2a. He vowed that he would avenge the insult.
<>With his wife and child he got out of the palace. He [Page252-a+ 65]
<>wandered about in search of disciples who were capable
<>of confronting with Drupada. At last he came to
<>Hastina1pura and became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130).
<NI>4) {%The revenge of Dron2a.%} Dron2a told Bhi1s2ma about his
<>dealings with Drupada. Bhi1s2ma consoled Dron2a. Before
<>the commencement of the training in archery, Dron2a
<>told his disciples: “When your training in archery is
<>completed you will have to do a favour to your tea-
<>cher”. All stood agape. But Arjuna came forward and
<>said: “I will do”. Dron2a embraced Arjuna. The train-
<>ing commenced. The Andhakas, Vr2s2n2is and others
<>joined his school of archery.
<NI>The training in archery came to an end. Dron2a called
<>his disciples and told them that Drupada should be
<>tied with a rope and placed before him. When they
<>heard the words of the teacher, Duryodhana, Karn2a, Yu-
<>yutsu, Dus4s4a1sana, Vikarn2a, Jara1sandha and Sulocana led
<>the Kauravas to Pa1n5ca1la. Arjuna knew that the
<>Kauravas would not be able to defeat Drupada. He
<>told the teacher that when the Kauravas returned
<>without achieving the task, he himself would go and
<>bring Drupada. After a terrible battle the Kauravas
<>were defeated by the Pa1n5ca1las. After that Arjuna con-
<>fronted Drupada. Nakula and Sahadeva stood as
<>guards of the wheels. Bhi1masena with his club stood
<>in front of the army. Arjuna drove the chariot right
<>in the midst of the Pa1n5ca1la army. Bhi1ma took his club
<>and a terrible battle ensued. Arjuna shattered the
<>Pa1n5ca1la army, bound Drupada and took him to Dron2a.
<>The teacher looked at Drupada and reproached him
<>with scornful word: “I have destroyed your country.
<>Now you are at my mercy. Is not the former friendship
<>a friendship?” Drupada requested that they should be
<>friends in future. Accordingly Drupada was set free.
<>The country of Pa1n5ca1la was divided into two, and
<>giving Uttara Pa1n5ca1la to Drupada, Dron2a took Daks2in2a
<>Pa1n5ca1la. Thus because of the revenge of Dron2a, Dru-
<>pada lost half of his kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 137).
<NI>5) {%Birth of Children.%} Though Dron2a and Drupada
<>were on friendly terms Drupada did not forget the
<>defeat he had incurred at the hands of Dron2a. So,
<>Drupada desired to have a son who would become
<>powerful enough to take revenge on Dron2a. He began
<>to think of ways and means. He consulted several
<>learned Brahmins. At that time two hermit brothers
<>ya1ja and Upaya1ja lived on the bank of the Ganges.
<>The King approached them and requested their help to
<>obtain a son, who would kill Dron2a, and promised to
<>give them cows and other precious things in return.
<>At first they refused to help him. The King served
<>Upaya1ja for a year, and pleased him. He sent the King
<>to the hermitage of Ya1ja. They accepted the request
<>of the King. Both the hermits performed a sacrifice
<>for Drupada. A boy and a girl arose from the sacrifi-
<>cial fire. The boy was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna and the
<>girl was named Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1). There was a celes-
<>tial voice that the boy would kill Dron2a when he grew
<>up. (M.B. A1di parva, Chapter 167).
<NI>6) {%The marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 grew up. Drupada
<>desired to give her in marriage to Arjuna. But at that
<>time the lac-house caught fire and the Pa1n2d2avas disap-
<>peared. Drupada set certain tests in the Svayam3vara
<>of Pa1n5ca1li1 with a view to ascertain if Arjuna was alive. [Page252-b+ 65]
<>The Pa1n2d2avas came to the svayam3vara and Drupada
<>found out Arjuna. But Drupada did not like the idea
<>of his daughter becoming the wife of more than one
<>husband. Then Vya1sa appeared there and informed
<>Drupada of the previous births of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. Drupada was much pleased and he gave the
<>Pa1n2d2avas a good deal of wealth and sent Pa1n5ca1li1 with
<>them. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 196).

<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Da1navas were the offsprings of Kas4yapa,
<>grandson of Brahma1 and son of Mari1ci by his wife
<>Danu, daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. Maya, chief among
<>the Da1navas earned great reputation as a unique archi
<>tect. Once Maya attended a dance programme in
<>devaloka where he fell in love with Hema1 dancing with
<>the deva-women. When the dance was over Maya told
<>Hema1 about his love for her. Hema1 too had fallen in
<>love with Maya. And they left the place in secret and
<>reached the southern slope of the Hima1layas where they
<>built a beautiful city called Hemapura and they lived
<>there. Ere long they-had two sons, Dundubhi and
<>Ma1ya1vi1, both of them equally distinguished in prowess.
<>Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Dundubhi's relati nship with Ra1van2a.%} Maya did tapas
<>for a daughter in the western plains of Mount Kaila1sa.
<>One of those days Pa1rvati1 went out of Kaila1sa to feed
<>brahmins in celebration of the birthday of Subrah-
<>man2ya. In the absence of Pa1rvati1 a deva woman called
<>Madhura1 who had observed the Somava1ravrata came
<>to Kaila1sa to salute Maha1deva (S4iva) who enjoyed her
<>for some time. On her return to S4iva Pa1rvati1 noticed
<>ashes worn by him transferred to the breasts of
<>Madhura1. Drawing the natural inference from this
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and cursed Madhura1 to be transform- [Page253-b+ 65]
<>ed into a frog. Then S4iva blessed her that she would
<>regain her former self after twelve years and have a
<>heroic husband. Madhura1 who was thus turned into a
<>frog fell into a well close to where Maya was engaged
<>in tapas. And, after twelve years, the frog regained its
<>former form and became Madhura1 again. Maya, who
<>saw her adopted her as daughter and brought her up as
<>such calling her Mandodari1. Mandodari1 became Ra1v-
<>an2a’ wife and thus Dundubhi became the brother-in-law
<>of Ra1van2a.
<NI>3) {%Dundubhi grew up.%} The following is told about Dun-
<>dubhi in Canto 11, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a.
<NI>As beautiful and majestic as the peak of Mount Kaila1sa,
<>the heroic Dundubhi possessed the form of the buffalo.
<>And, he had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<>Proud and haughty over his own prowess and losing his
<>head over the boon he had received from God, Dundu-
<>bhi went to fight with the ocean, the lord of rivers. (It
<>was S4iva who gave him boons. See M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 11).
<NI>4) {%Fight with Ba1li and death.%} Haughty almost to mad-
<>ness over the unrivalled strength and prowess he got as
<>the result of the boon, Dundubhi went about challeng-
<>ing whomsoever he met for a fight. But none dared to
<>accept the challenge. Then he went to the sea-shore
<>and challenged Varun2a, who, appearing on the crest
<>of the waves said: “I am not strong and powerful
<>enough to fight with you. Only Himava1n can do that.
<>So, please go north.”
<NI>Accordingly Dundubhi went north to Himava1n and
<>challenged him in great rage. Himava1n clad in his neat
<>and white apparel appeared and spoke in humble tones:
<>“Oh mighty Da1nava: I am not accustomed to fighting
<>war. My job is only to arrange necessary conveni-
<>ence to saints and sages. But, there is in southern India
<>a very powerful monkey called Ba1li, who is the King of
<>Kis2kindha1, and Ba1li alone can combat with you.
<NI>And, Dundubhi accordingly went southward to Kis2kin-
<>dha1 and challenged Ba1li. Terrible as the dark clouds in
<>the sky the da1nava who possessed the body and
<>horns of the buffalo--began roaring like hell at the tower
<>gates of Kis2kindha1, uprooting trees with his horn and
<>tearing the earth with his hoofs. Disturbed by the noise
<>Ba1li along with his wife Ta1ra1 came out of the palace,
<>and said to Dundubhi: “Look here, please, I am only
<>a King of the monkeys. Why should you, who are so
<>very strong smash my tower?” but, these soft words of
<>Ba1li only kindled Dundubhi's anger all the more and his
<>challenges became the fiercer. Then did Ba1li, wearing
<>the golden chain given by Indra, rush forth to engage
<>Dundubhi in mortal duel in which the former began
<>gaining more and more strength while the latter got wea-
<>ker and weaker. Dundubhi took to flight in the skies to
<>save his life. But, the moon dawned then and in the
<>moonlight Ba1li and his brother Sugri1va followed Dun-
<>dubhi, who entered a terrible cave covered by something
<>like a forest of grass. After stationing Sugri1va at the
<>opening of the cave Ba1li followed Dundubhi into the
<>cave. Sugri1va waited there one year for the return of
<>Ba1li from the cave when one day he witnessed foaming
<>blood flow out of the mouth of the cave, and mistakenly
<>believing that Ba1li was dead he closed the mouth of the
<>cave with a huge stone and returned home. But, Ba1li,
<>who had by then killed Dundubhi kicked off the stone [Page254-a+ 65]
<>and came out of the cave and followed Sugri1va in a
<>rage. From that day onwards S4ugri1va lived at the R2s2ya-
<>mu1ka mountain where Ba1li had no admission. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 9, 11, 46).
<NI>5) {%Curse on Ba1li due to the blood of Dundubhi.%} During
<>Ba1li's duel with Dundubhi blood from the body of the
<>latter spurted out to the skies, and it also fell in the
<>hermitage of Matan3ga at R2s2yamu1ka where the sage
<>Matan3ga was performing tapas. Angered at this the sage
<>cursed him whoever he might be, who was responsible
<>for blood falling in his a1s4rama, with death by his head
<>getting broken if he mounted R2s2yamu1ka. Sugri1va took
<>shelter there because of this curse on Ba1li. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Canto 11)
<HI>DUNDUBHI II. See under Manthara1.
<HI>DUNDUBHINIHRA1DA. A powerful Ra1ks2asa, who was
<>the son of Diti and the uncle of Prahla1da. When, in
<>the fierce fight between the devas and the asuras the
<>latter got absolutely defeated this Ra1ks2asa ascribed
<>the reson for the failure to the brahmins and began
<>killing them. He captured the Ka1s4i1 temple and many
<>other temples like it. In the circumstances S4iva gave
<>refuge to the brahmins of Ka1s4i1, and the Ra1ks2asa was
<>destroyed by S4ivas4akti. (S4ivarudrasam3hita1, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 58).
<HI>DUNDUBHISVANA(M). A particular Place in Kus4a
<>island. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 13).
<HI>DURA1DHA (DURA1DHA1RA, DURDHARA). One of

<>Bhi1ma. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 135, Verse 36).
<HI>DURA1DHA1RA. See under Dura1dha.
<HI>DURA1SADA. A son of Bhasma1sura. He learned Pan5ca1k-
<>s2ari1 vidya1 from S4iva and used to repeat it. Pleased at
<>this S4iva gave him all the boons he wanted with the
<>result that he lost his head and began troubling every-
<>body. When thus unrest and injustices increased in the
<>world D2hum3d2hi, the son of S4akti killed him. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 38, 42).
<HI>DURDAMA. Son of a Gandharva called Vis4va1vasu.
<>The following story about him is told in the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a. Chapters 1, 3 and 4).
<NI>While mahars2is like Vasis2t2ha and Atri were once
<>engaged in the worship of Lord S4iva at Mount Kaila1sa,
<>Durdama, with his thousands of wives came there. In
<>the Ha1la1syati1rtha near-by they got engaged in water
<>sports with their bodies stark naked. On seeing their
<>naked sports Vasis2t2ha cursed Durdama to be turned
<>into a Ra1ks2asa. When his wives begged of Vasis2t2ha for
<>redemption from the curse he told them that seven-
<>teen years thence Durdama would regain his old form.
<>Durdama thus turned Ra1ks2asa tried once to devour
<>sage Ga1lava when the Sudars4ana Cakra of Vis2n2u killed
<>him. He regained his old form and returned to
<>Gandharvaloka.
<HI>DURDHARS2AN2A. (Durmada). One of the hundred
<>sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed by Bhi1ma. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 155, Verse 40).
<HI>DURGA1 I. The goddess of the universe, Durga1
<>possesses different forms and aspects. Pa1rvati1, spouse of
<>S4iva is a form of Durga1. According to the prayer of
<>devotees this Devi1 assumes diverse forms. She is
<>worshipped in 64 forms as A1ryadurga1, Vedagarbha1,
<>Ambika1, Bhadraka1li1, Bhadra1, Ks2ema1ks2emakari1, Naika-
<>ba1hu, Devi1 etc. In south India she is worshipped more
<>in her fierce and terrible forms. Devi1 in her gentle [Page254-b+ 65]
<>aspects and moods assumes the forms of Kanya1,
<>Ka1ma1ks2i1 and Mu1ka1mba1. In Kerala the Devi1 is called
<>Bhagavati1 also, in Andhra Jokula1mbika1 and in Tamil-
<>nadu Kan2n2aki1. Worship of the Devi1 is supposed to be
<>more than 4000 years old in India. In religious litera-
<>ture from Vedic times up to date Devi1 occupies an
<>important place. In modern India S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa, guru of Sva1mi1 Viveka1nanda, was a great
<>devotee of Durga1.
<NI>In the Maha1bha1rata there are various references to the
<>Devi1. When the Pa1n2d2avas entered the capital of Vira1t2a
<>for their life incognito they worshiped Durga1, who
<>appeared to them and granted them certain boons.
<>(Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 6). At the commencement of
<>the great war Arjuna, at the instance of Kr2s2n2a prayed
<>to Durga1, who appeared in the sky and granted him
<>boons, for victory in War. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 23).
<>See Pan5cadevi1s and Prakr2ti).
<HI>DURGA1 II. A river famous in ancient India. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas drank water from this river. (Bhi1s2ma Parva.
<>Chapter 9, Verse 33).
<HI>DURGA(M). Fort. There are six kinds of forts, viz.
<>Marudurgam, Jaladurgam, Pr2thvi1durgam Vanadurgam,
<>Parvatadurgam, and Manus2y adurgam. Among the
<>above six Manus2ya durga is the most important (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 56, 35).
<HI>DURGAJAM. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 9, Verse 52).
<HI>DURGAMA. An asura chief born in the dynasty of
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a and son of Taru, Durgama was an enemy
<>of the Devas from his very birth. He argued to him-
<>self thus: “the very strength and power of the
<>Devas depend on the Vedas; if there is no Veda there is
<>no yajn5a, if there is no yajn5a the Devas do not get
<>their share of the havis, if they do not get the havis
<>they will lose all their strength and prowess, and, there-
<>fore, the best means to teach the Devas a lesson is to
<>destroy the Vedas.” Durgama decided that the surest
<>means to achieve that was to perform penance. Accor-
<>dingly he went to the Hima1layas and began doing
<>penance abstaining from food and drink. After a thou-
<>sand years Brahma1 appeared to him and asked him
<>what boon he wanted. Durgama said “I must get the
<>Vedas; I should get all the mantras known to brahmins
<>and Devas in the three worlds, and all the presiding
<>deities of those mantras should come and stand before
<>me and be subject to my control; I must also get the
<>strength to defeat all the Devas.” Brahma1 granted
<>Durgama all the boons. And, thenceforth the brahmins
<>could not recollect the Vedas or the mantras. No
<>bathing, no homas, no daily rites, no rites for the dead,
<>no yajn5as, no japa (repeating divine names) and no
<>tapas. Symptoms of old age caught the Devas in its
<>grips. Durgama drove them out of Devaloka and they
<>hid in mountain caves. Within a hundred years the
<>world reached the rock bottom of destruction. Water
<>disappeared from the world. Alarmed beyond measure
<>at these developments the brahmins went to the Hima1l-
<>ayas and prayed to Jagadambika1 (mother of the uni-
<>verse). Ambika1 appeared to them, and their lamenta-
<>tions brought tears to the eyes of Ambika1, and thus
<>water scarcity came to an end. Ambika1 gave them S4a1ka
<>(a vegetable) fruits and roots to eat. Because she pro-
<>tected her devotees by supplying S4a1ka to them she
<>came to be known as S4a1kambhari1, thenceforward. Also [Page255-a+ 65]
<>because she shed tears from her eyes, thenceforth she
<>came to be addressed as S4ata1ks2i1 also.
<NI>Being told about the above developments Durgama,
<>with his army attacked Devi1. The fight became fierce
<>and furious. From Devi1's body emerged numerous
<>S4aktis fully armed. Dha1rin2i1, Ba1la1, Tripura1, Bhairavi1
<>and Ka1li1 with 10,000 hands were some of the promi-
<>nent and powerful S4aktis which thus emerged. The
<>army of Durgama was annihilated. Then the fight
<>commenced directly between Devi1 and Durgama.
<>Fifteen arrows of Devi1 hit the asura at the very same
<>time and he was killed. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha).

<HI>DURJAYA I. An absolutely cruel King. Owing to the
<>number of adharmas (evil actions he had committed)
<>Ka1la ordained him to be born and reborn twentyone
<>times as various animals and as a Brahmara1ks2asa he
<>roamed about forests. One of those days he caught
<>hold of a S4i1vayogi1 called Maha1deva whose body was
<>smeared with Vibhu1ti (the sacred ash), but as soon as
<>the Vibhu1ti from the body of the S4ivayogi1 got smeared
<>on his body also, Durjaya got back his former form
<>and he was lifted upto Svarga. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Bhasma
<>Ma1ha1tmya).

<>Himself and Unmada1, the apsara1 woman impersonated

<>Vasumanas, who happened to come that way on his
<>fast-riding horse Ji1mu1ta heard the lamentations of
<>Harin2i1, and after killing Pin3gala1ks2a he took her with
<>him to her palace. The King of Videha and his sub-
<>jects, who were in great anxiety and distress at the
<>disappearance of Harin2i1 felt really happy to have her
<>back. And, all of them opined that Harin2i1 should be
<>married to Vasumanas. Accordingly the date for her
<>Svayam3vara was announced. But, on the day of the
<>svayam3vara Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehaya who, along
<>with other Kings was also present on the occasion,
<>forcibly took Harin2i1 and rode off with her. According
<>to the condition laid down by Urvas4i1 for redemption
<>from her curse Durmada was born as son of Harin2i1 and
<>he was named Durmada.
<NI>Bhadras4ren2ya, Harin2i1 and Durmada lived very happily
<>in the Hehaya palace. When Durmada came of age he
<>married Citra1n3gi1, his uncle's daughter on the advice
<>of sage Garga. Soon war broke out between Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya, and Divoda1sa, King of Ka1s2i in which Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya was killed. Harin2i1 courted death by fire,
<>regained her former life and under the name Unmada1
<>returned to the world of the Apsaras.

<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi (ocean of milk), many excellent things emer-
<>ged out of it. When those things were divided among
<>them all, Devendra took possession of 14 gems in an
<>unauthorised manner. When Jalandhara, through his
<>messenger Durva1ran2a, demanded Devendra to return
<>the gems, not only did he not return them but he also
<>declared war against Jalandhara. When war broke out
<>Jalandhara hesitated as to whether he should fight
<>with Vis2n2u or with S4iva. Durva1ran2a advised him first
<>to fight with S4iva. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttarakhan2d2a,
<>Chapter 16).
<HI>DURVA1SAS
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A sage, who used to lose his temper
<>very easily. He is believed to have been born from an
<>am3s4a (part, aspect) of S4iva. [Page256-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three different stories are told in the
<>Pura1n2as relating to his birth.
<NI>(1) Once a quarrel, arose between Brahma1 and S4iva
<>which developed into fighting, At the sight of S4iva
<>seething with rage the Devas ran off frightened, and
<>Pa1rvati1 also got frightened. She told him ‘Durva1sam
<>bhavati me’. (It has become impossible for me to live
<>happily with you). Realising that it was his momentary
<>anger which made life miserable for Pa1rvati1 S4iva
<>decided to transfer that trait of his character to some-
<>one else.
<NI>The incident took place during the life period of
<>S4i1lavati1, who was very much reputed for her chastity.
<>While S4i1lavati1 was carrying her husband Ugras4ravas
<>(who though a leper yet desired to visit brothels) to
<>the house of a prostitute the muni An2uma1n2d2avya
<>cursed Ugras4ravas to die before sunrise the next day
<>with his head broken. (See under An2uma1n2d2avya).
<>S4i1lavati1 made the counter curse, let not the sun rise the
<>next day, to the muni's curse. Accordingly the sun did
<>not rise the next day, and confusion prevailed every-
<>where, whereupon the Trimu1rtis and the Devas, through
<>Anasu1ya1, the wife of Atrimahars2i, got the curse of
<>S4i1lavati1 withdrawn. Pleased at this the Trimu1rtis
<>asked Anasu1ya1 to choose any boon she desired, and she
<>prayed that Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara take their
<>partial incarnations through her. Accordingly Brahma1
<>as Candra and Maha1vis2n2u as Datta1treya were born as
<>sons of Anasu1ya1. And, S4iva deposited his anger, which
<>had caused unhappiness to Pa1rvati1, in Anasu1ya1. The
<>child born out of that aspect of S4iva to Anasu1ya1 was
<>Durva1sas. The name Durva1sas was very apt as the
<>child was born out of the anger of S4iva which had
<>made life miserable (durva1sa) for Pa1rvati1. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>(2) Once defeated in his fight with Brahma1 S4iva took
<>refuge with the Narana1ra1yan2as who were doing penance
<>in the plains of the Hima1layas. S4iva told sage
<>Na1ra1yan2a everything about his plight and he asked the
<>former to pierce his left hand with the S4u1la. S4iva did
<>so and three streams of blood flowed out of the wound
<>made on the hand of the R2s2i, one stream towards the
<>sphere of the stars, another into the skull in S4iva's
<>hand and from the third stream Durva1sas was born.
<>Brahma1, who witnessed this miracle withdrew from
<>war and returned to his abode. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) In the fierce fight with the Tripuras S4iva, in great
<>rage, ultimately shot an arrow against them, and that
<>arrow, after killing the Tripuras, assumed the form of
<>a child and returned to the lap of S4iva, and the child
<>was named Durva1sas. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 160, Verses 14, 15).
<NI>3) {%Kunti1 granted boon.%} Once while Kunti1 was living in
<>the palace of Kuntibhoja Durva1sas came there, and
<>pleased with Kunti1, he granted her five mantras. It
<>was with the aid of those mantras that Kunti became
<>mother of Karn2a and others. (For details see under
<>Kunti Para 2).
<NI>4) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a bathed in pa1yasa (pudding).%} Once Durva1sas
<>came to Dva1raka1 where Kr2s2n2a and Rukmini1 looked
<>after him to his heart's content. Though, at times he
<>took only meagre food, at other times he destroyed
<>everything he saw and created trouble. Kr2s2n2a and
<>Rukmin2i1 served him according to schedule. One day [Page257-a+ 65]
<>the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to cook some pudding and it was
<>got ready. Then the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to smear his
<>(Kr2s2n2a) body with pudding. Kr2s2n2a did so except on
<>his feet. After that Durva1sas got down the chariot and
<>making Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 serve as horses himself got
<>into it and drove away in great speed into the forest.
<>On the way he thrashed the ‘horses’ one ofter the
<>other. Neither Kr2s2n2a nor Rukmin2i1 felt sorry about this
<>action of the sage. On reaching the forest he halted
<>the chariot and blessed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a that arrows would
<>not hit the parts of Kr2s2n2a's body which were smeared
<>with the pa1yasa. The spot at which the sage blessed
<>Kr2s2n2a became famous as Varada1nati1rtha in after years.
<>It may be noted that Kr2s2n2a died by an arrow hitting
<>his foot which was not smeared with the pa1yasa. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 160).
<NI>5) {%Conducted yajn5a for S4vetaki.%} There once was a King
<>called S4vetaki equal to Indra. He conducted a yajn5a
<>of a hundred years' duration. Innumerable brahmins
<>were engaged in the successful conduct of the yajn5a.
<>Some years after the yajn5a began the brahmins went
<>their own way leaving it unfinished as the clouds of
<>fume all the twentyfour hours in the yajn5as4a1la1 irked
<>and affected their eyes. When S4vetaki requested them
<>to further cooperate to complete the yajn5a they
<>insultingly asked him to invite S4u1dras for it. Then
<>the King went to the Hima1layas and did tapas for
<>S4iva, who at last deputed Durva1sas to complete the
<>yajn5a, and under the mahars2i's aegis it was completed
<>within twelve years. On account of the constant offe-
<>rings of havis in Agni (fire) during the period Agni
<>fell a prey to indigestion, which was cured only after
<>it ate up the Kha1n2d2ava forest. (See Kha1n2d2ava dahana).
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 235).
<NI>6) {%Mudgala granted salvation.%} Once Durva1sas went to
<>sage Mudgala who was doing tapas in Kuruks2etra
<>taking food only rarely and demanded some food with
<>the object of testing his dharmavr2tti (righteousness).
<>The sage gave Durva1sas all the food he had with him,
<>himself starving, and Durva1sas left the a1s4rama after
<>eating a part of the food and smearing his body with
<>the rest of it. This process was repeated by Durva1sas
<>for six days, but Mudgala never felt or showed any
<>offence. Greatly pleased at the firm righteousness of
<>the King. Durva1sas blessed him to bodily ascend to
<>heaven. Immediately a vima1na (aeroplane) descended
<>from Vis2n2uloka and carried Mudgala in it to heaven.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 260).
<NI>7) {%Other information.%} (1) Durva1sas ran away in fear of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. (See under Duryodhana, Para 12).
<NI>(2) He suffered at the hands of Ham3sa and D2ibhaka.
<>(See under D2ibhaka).
<NI>(3) He advised S4aivapan5ca1ks2ara to the woman called
<>Kala1vati1. (See under Kala1vati1).
<NI>(4) Durva1sas and Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam. (See under
<>Amr2tam).
<NI>(5) Durva1sas and Daks2ayajn5a. (See under Daks2a).
<NI>(6) Terrified Durva1sas ran helter-skelter in the three
<>worlds. (See under Am3bari1s2a, Para 3).
<NI>(7) He was responsible for the death of Laks2man2a.
<>(See Laks2man2a).
<NI>(8) He cursed S4akuntala1. (See S4akuntala1).
<NI>(9) He spent his time in Indra's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 23: For another story
<>see under Pitr2ti1rtha). [Page257-b+ 64]
<HI>DURVIBHA1GA. A particular area in ancient India.
<>The Ks2atriya kings of the area presented a lot of
<>money and foodgrains to Yudhis2t2hira at the Ra1jasu1ya
<>yajn5a. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 11).
<HI>DURVIGA1HA (DURVIS2AHA). One of the hundred
<>sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed in the great war by
<>Bhi1masena. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 26, Verse 20).
<HI>DURVIMOCANA. One of the hundred sons of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra killed by Bhi1masena. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>127, Verse 62).
<HI>DURVIROCANA. One of the hundred sons of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra killed by Bhi1masena (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>127, Verse 62).
<HI>DURVIS2AHA (DURVIGA1HA). One of the 100 sons
<>or Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He attended the svayam3vara of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1, On the occasion of the procession of Duryo-
<>dhana and others, Durvis2aha was put in prison. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 242, Verse 12). He was killed by
<>Bhi1masena in the great war. (S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>26, Verse 20).
<HI>DURYODHANA I. Villain in the Maha1bha1rata story;
<>the eldest and greatest of the Kauravas.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Kauravas.
<NI>(2) {%Birth.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra born blind married Ga1ndha1ri1.
<>Hungry and thirsty, Vya1sa once came to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>palace where Ga1ndha1ri1 treated him sumptuously, and
<>he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband.
<>Ere long Ga1ndha1ri1 conceived, but even after two years
<>she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got
<>herself aborted in secret as the result of which she
<>‘delivered’ a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vya1sa
<>visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled
<>with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold
<>water as a result of which it got divided into hundred
<>pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of
<>flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the
<>pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place.
<>Vya1sa departed for the Hima1layas for tapas.
<NI>In course of time the pots burst open one by one and
<>from each pot emerged a boy. From the 101st pot a girl
<>was born. Eldest among the boys was named
<>Duryodhana, and the girl called Dus4s4ala1. (For other
<>names see under Kauravas).
<NI>Duryodhana, at the time of his birth cried in the voice
<>of an ass on hearing which the asses kept in their shed
<>also cried. Also, such evil omens as the jackal howling,
<>birds like crows, vultures etc. crying and storms break-
<>ing out were witnessed on the occasion. Alarmed by
<>such evil omens Dhr2tara1s2t2ra sent for the brahmins and
<>his other friends and well-wishers like Bhi1s2ma and Vidura
<>and enquired of them whether, after the death of
<>Dharmaputra, Duryodhana would be able to become
<>King. As soon as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra had asked the question, evil
<>omens like the world becoming dim, jackals howling etc.
<>were witnessed again. Scholars like Vidura did their best
<>to divine what the future of Duryodhana would be, and
<>after mature consideration Vidura and the brahmin
<>pandits opined that because of Duryodhana's birth the
<>country and people would be ruined, and they, there-
<>fore advised that he should be cast away and forsaken.
<>But, paternal affection did not permit Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to
<>accept the advice.
<NI>During this period Ga1ndha1ri1 was laid up for a few days
<>with stomach trouble, and a vais4ya woman was engaged [Page258-a+ 65]
<>to look after Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who begot of her a son called
<>Yuyutsu.
<F>1. Vya1sa blessed Ga1ndha1ri1 to have 100 sons. Then how was it that she got a daughter too? On being questioned thus by King
<>Janamejaya Vais4am3pa1yana replied “when Vya1sa was dividing the mass of flesh a desire to have a daughter entered the heart of Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and divining that desire Vya1sa cut the flesh in such a manner as to have one more piece, viz. 101</F> Thus with 100 sons and Dus4s4ala1 for daughter
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra became rich in the matter of children
<F>2. Duryodhana was born as a part of Kali. (M.B. A1s4rama va1sika Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<>(M.B. Adi Parva, Chapter 114).
<NI>(2) {%Duryodhana harms Bhi1masena.%} Now, Pa1n2d2u was
<>dead and Ma1dri1 also died in the funeral pyre of her
<>husband. Forlorn and helpless Kunti1 and her five sons
<>came to Hastina1pura, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra welcomed them
<>to the palace. Thus arose the occasion for the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas to live together in the Hastina1-
<>pura palace. And, naturally there used to be petty
<>differences and quarrels between the Pa1n2d2ava and
<>Kaurava princes. Bhi1ma being in every way a giant the
<>Kauravas had often to suffer at his hands. To collect all
<>the hundred Kaurava brothers together and throw them
<>away in one lump to push them to the ground, to suffo-
<>cate them by holding their heads under water etc--these
<>were some of the childish pranks played by Bhi1ma on
<>the Kauravas. The constant repetition of such pranks
<>and mischiefs on the part of Bhi1ma rendered him an
<>object of hatred for the Kauravas among whom the
<>common conviction grew that it was essential to put an
<>end to Bhi1ma's life for their safety, nay even their very
<>existence.
<NI>One day, the Kauravas, with the object of doing away
<>with Bhi1ma, escorted the Pa1n2d2avas to Prama1n2akot2i on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for water sports. There all of
<>them ate sumptuous meals and took various drinks. But,
<>Duryodhana had secretly mixed Ka1laku1t2a poison in the
<>food of Bhi1ma. After taking meals they began playing
<>water-sports. After the sports were over they returned
<>to their tents and slept. Owing to the effects of the
<>poison and the overexertion during the day Bhi1ma
<>slept stone dead. While all were asleep during the night
<>Duryodhana bound the hands and legs of Bhi1ma with
<>cords and threw him into the depths of the Ga1n3ga1.
<>Bhi1ma who was still unconscious sank down to the very
<>bottom of the river where the denizens of na1galoka saw
<>him and the na1gas bit him in anger. The poison of the
<>na1gas neutralised the effects of Ka1laku1t2a poison in
<>Bhi1ma, though their bite could not make even a scratch
<>on his skin. Freed thus from the effects of poison Bhi1ma
<>shook himself up from sleep and drove off the na1gas.
<>Alarmed at these developments the na1gas called Va1suki
<>up to the scene, and he, recognising Bhi1ma held him in
<>embrace and gave him much money and costly gems
<>etc. Bhi1ma refused the gifts, but asked Va1suki for na1ga-
<>rasa, which would impart the strength of thousand na1gas
<>to those who used it. Va1suki gave Bhi1ma eight potfuls
<>of na1garasa, which the latter drank to the last dregs
<>and thus gained immeasurable strength.
<NI>When next morning after the water-sports the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas awoke from sleep Bhi1ma was found
<>missing. Duryodhana said that Bhi1ma had returned
<>earlier to Hastina1pura, but this did not satisfy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. Kunti1 lamented over the absence of Bhi1ma.
<NI>Bhi1ma, who drank the na1ga rasa lay on the veranda of
<>Va1suki for eight days in the manner of one who had
<>lost consciousness. By the time he woke up on the eighth
<>day the body had almost fully assimilated the rasa.
<>Va1suki told Bhi1ma that eight potfuls of na1garasa [Page258-b+ 61]
<>would impart the strength of 10,000 elephants. And
<>then at the instance of Va1suki Bhi1ma took his bath in
<>holy waters and wore new clothes and fragrant garland.
<>He ate the pudding offered by Va1suki, and taking leave
<>of him and followed by na1gas he came up from the
<>water to the bank of the Gan3ga1. Bhi1ma gave a detailed
<>description to his mother and brothers of all that had
<>happened to him. Dharmaputra advised him to keep
<>the secret. After the incident, once again was Ka1laku1t2a
<>poison mixed in the food of Bhi1ma. But, Yuyutsu born
<>of the vais4ya woman to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra gave the Pa1n2d2avas
<>confidential report about it. Because of the powerful
<>effect of na1ga rasa, the Ka1laku1t2a consumed by Bhi1ma
<>did no harm to him but it only got assimilated in his
<>body. On another occasion Duryodhana killed the
<>charioteer of Bhi1ma. (Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, Chapter 127 and
<>129).
<NI>3) {%Karn2a crowned king of An3ga.%} The Kauravas and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas learnt the use of weapons of war at the feet
<>of Dron2a1ca1rya, and when the studies were over arrange-
<>ments were made for a rehearsal, and at the rehearsal
<>Bhi1ma and Duryodhana were the first to clash with
<>each other. When the encounter reached its climax
<>both of them pointed the club at each other. But, As4vat-
<>tha1ma1 intervened and pacified them. Next Karn2a enter-
<>ed the stage for a trial of strength with Arjuna, and
<>at once arose from the Pa1n2d2ava side questions about
<>Karn2a's nobility and aristocracy of birth etc. Karn2a
<>stood there stunned, not knowing what to say or how
<>to repel the attack. Then it was Duryodhana who rose
<>up to announce that he was, that very moment, crowning
<>Karn2a King of An3ga. This ended the scene. (Bha1rata
<>(Malaya1lam), A1di Parva, Chapters 134, 135 and 136).
<NI>4) {%Pa1n2d2avas trapped in palace built of lac.%} The above
<>incident confirmed and completed the cleavage of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas into two hostile camps.
<>Meantime another event happened. Dron2a1ca1rya demand-
<>ed of his pupils to bring before him King Drupada
<>by way of gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee), for the a1ca1rya had
<>to wreak vengeance upon Drupada (See under Dron2a).
<>Though Duryodhana tried his best he could not capture
<>Drupada. Not only that, Drupada defeated him also in
<>fight. At this junture it was Arjuna who presented
<>Drupada as captive to Dron2a by way of gurudaks2in2a1.
<>The incident proved to be another provocation for
<>Duryodhana to hate the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>Now, Duryodhana made up his mind to destroy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas somehow or other. With this end in view he
<>went to his father, posing himself to be a great well-
<>wisher of the Pa1n2d2avas, and obtained his permission to
<>transfer their (Pa1n2d2avas') residence to another palace.
<>Accordingly Duryodhana deputed his minister Purocana
<>to get built at Va1ran2a1vata a palace of lac. Vidura came
<>to know of the intended mischief and gave advance
<>notice of it to the Pa1n2d2avas through a messenger
<>Kanaka. The architect built the ‘lac palace’ but built a
<>tunnel also attached to it. A year after the Pa1n2d2avas shift-
<>ed the residence to the new ‘palace’ Duryodhana set.
<>fire to it, and the Pa1n2d2avas escaped unscathed through
<>this tunnel. (Bha1rata (Malaya1lam) A1di Parva, Chapters
<>141-151). [Page259-a+ 64]
<NI>5) {%Duryodhana invited the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hastina1pura.%}
<>Duryodhana and his brothers were living very happily
<>under the impression that the Pa1n2d2avas had been burnt
<>to ashes along with the ‘lac Palace’. Then it was that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas, disguised as brahmins and in the presence
<>of all the Kings, won Pa1n5ca1li1, the daughter of King
<>Drupada, in svayam3vara, for their wife. After the
<>marriage the Pa1n2d2avas stayed in Drupada's palace and
<>the Kauravas returned to Hastina1pura. Duryodhana
<>and others felt all the more jealous at the Pa1n2d2avas'
<>becoming more powerful as a result of their marriage.
<>Again it was decided that the Pa1n2d2avas should be des-
<>troyed anyhow and at any cost. But, how to effect the
<>destruction? Duryodhana wanted to attract the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas to destruction through women and to create diffe-
<>rences and divisions among them. But, Karn2a attacked
<>the plan as impracticable, and instead he wanted to
<>defeat Drupada and render the Pa1n2d2avas impotent. At
<>this stage Bhi1s2ma and Dron2a argued that it was most
<>preferable to give half the Kingdom to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and receive them with grace. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra supported
<>the proposal as a result of which the Kauravas went to
<>Pa1n5ca1la and escorted the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hasti-
<>na1pura. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra partitioned the country between
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas and the latter shifted
<>their residence to their part of the country with Kha1n2-
<>d2avaprasth2a (Indraprastha) as its capital. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas went to Indraprastha Maya built for them
<>an2 exceptionally beautiful palace where King Dharma-
<>putra performed {%ra1jasu1ya.%} Duryodhana and others ear-
<>nestly participated in it. After the ra1jasu1ya the Kaura-
<>vas wanted to have a look at the palace and in the
<>course of surveying it they placed themselves in
<>ridiculous situations due to visual illusions. Taking the
<>bright floors of glass for watery tanks they pulled up
<>their clothings and measured with caution every foot of
<>theirs. Then they mistook actual pools for floor and fell
<>into them and got wet. At the consequent discomfiture
<>of the Kauravas Bhi1ma clapped his hands and roared
<>with laughter. Draupadi1 hid her face with hands and
<>smiled. Altogether the Kauravas cut a very ridiculous
<>figure, and they returned to Hastina1pura. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 202, Sabha1 Parva, Chapters 35, 85).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's first defeat in the game of dice.%} The
<>sight of the great wealth including costly stones and
<>gems presented by various kings to Dharmaputra at the
<>Ra1jasu1ya and the humiliation experienced while survey-
<>ing the palace made Duryodhana all the more mad
<>with anger and hatred towards the Pa1n2d2avas. He now
<>came to the decision either to defeat the Pa1n2d2avas once
<>for all or to commit suicide by taking poison. He held
<>secret consultations on the topic with S4akuni whose
<>efforts at first to pacify him (Duryodhana) failed. Ulti-
<>mately S4akuni, an expert in the game of dice, advised
<>Duryodhana to invite Dharmaputra to a game, assuring
<>him that the rest he would take care of. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Vidura advised Duryodhana against the move, but he
<>did not yield. Finally Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, saying to himself
<>that nobody would change fate, agreed to Duryodhana's
<>proposal, and deputed Vidura to Dharmaputra to invite
<>him for the game.
<NI>Dharmaputra, in fact, did not like the game, but he
<>succumbed to the eloquence and persuasive powers of
<>S4akuni and at last agreed to play. Kings lined up the [Page259-b+ 64]
<>royal hall to witness the game. First gems were staked.
<>and Duryodhana won the game. Then 1000 golden niskas
<F>1. 108 suvarn2a weight, an ornament worn on the chest.</F>
<>and treasuries were offered to the winner. Duryodhana
<>won that game also. Next chariot with horses and next
<>to that 1000 maid-servants were staked and Duryodhana
<>won those games too. 1000 horses, 1000 golden chariots
<>with their horses, the horse decorated with gold presen-
<>ted by Citraratha to Arjuna, 6000 soldiers with their
<>arms and armaments--these formed the next successive
<>bets, and each game Dharmaputra lost. The next bet
<>was 400 copper vessels each filled with pure gold, and
<>Duryodhana won that game also. And, now Vidura
<>tried to dissuade Yudhis2t2hira from playing the game;
<>but neither he nor Duryodhana heeded the advice. And,
<>Duryodhana by foul play snatched from Dharmaputra
<>all his wealth, his kingdom and his brothers. Now, Pa1n5-
<>ca1li1 alone remained, and Dharmaputra bet her too
<>and played the last game and lost.
<NI>Duryodhana deputed his Su1ta, Pra1tika1mi, to Indra-
<>prastha, to fetch Draupadi1 but she sent him back. Next
<>Dus4s4a1sana was deputed and he brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to the
<>sabha1 dragging her by the hair. She was proclaimed to
<>be the maid-servant of the Kauravas. At last Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>intervened and sent back the Pa1n2d2avas along with
<>Draupadi1 to Indraprastha.
<NI>7) {%Second game and exile in the forest.%} Duryodhana and
<>others did not appreciate the intervention of their father.
<>He again conspired with S4akuni and it was decided to
<>challenge Dharmaputra to one more game. The condi-
<>tions to be stipulated were that the vanquished in the
<>game should stay in exile for twelve years in the forest
<>and live incognito during the thirteenth year, and if
<>found out and recognised during this period the whole
<>process of exile and life incognito would have to be
<>repeated. Duryodhana and S4ukuni approached Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and said to him thus: “Dear father, the desire
<>for revenge at their defeat in the game of dice gnaws
<>at the Pa1n2d2avas' heart like poison. Also, they will never
<>forget our having dragged Draupadi1 by her hair. When
<>a suitable occasion arises they will take revenge on the
<>whole lot of us. Therefore, we want to challenge
<>Dharmaputra to a final game of dice, the condition
<>being that he who gets defeated should go in exile into
<>the forest for twelve years and then to live incognito
<>for one year. If we get defeated we will simply carry
<>out the condition on our part.
<NI>This request of Duryodhana appealed to his father, who
<>invited Dharmaputra once again for a game of dice.
<>Dharmaputra accepted the invitation, in fact, in spite
<>of himself. This time too Duryodhana won the stake
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas set out to the forest. Even at the
<>time of parting Dus4s4a1sana insulted Bhi1ma who retorted
<>thus: “You, mean fellows, you cheated my brother by
<>foul play. If I fail to tear your heart open in fight and
<>drink blood I do not want heaven. Moreover I will kill
<>Duryodhana, and Arjuna will kill Karn2a. S4akuni, the
<>expert in foul play in dice will be killed by Sahadeva.
<>We will meet in the 14th year from today at the
<>battlefield. Adieu.”
<NI>Thus did the Pa1n2d2avas depart for the forest. Kunti1
<>being too old Vidura took her to his house, and he
<>consoled her, lamenting over the separation from her
<>children. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva). [Page260-a+ 64]
<NI>8) {%Curse of Maitreya.%} The Pa1n2d2avas entered the
<>Ka1myaka forest where they were welcomed by the
<>sages. Among them Maitreya whom the misfortune
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas affected much started for Hastina1pura
<>for peace parleys. Vidura advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that
<>Maitreya's proposals should be respected lest he should
<>curse the King. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Duryodhana received
<>the sage with respect. And, the sage asked them to
<>recall the Pa1n2d2avas from the forest and live on friendly
<>terms with them. Duryodhana did not in any manner
<>respond to the advice of the sage, but stood there
<>absolutely mum tapping his thigh with his fingers and
<>making drawings with the fingers of his feet on the
<>ground. This the sage interpreted as an insult to him.
<>He stood up ablaze with anger and cursed Duryodhana
<>thus: “You will, sooner than later reap the conse-
<>quences of your false pride; your cruelty will invite
<>terrible war, and in the fight Bhi1ma will rend asunder
<>your thigh, which you struck with your fingers
<>just now.”
<NI>Greatly agitated over the curse Dhr2tara1s2t2ra prayed
<>the sage for redemption and the sage said: “if only
<>your son resorts to forebearance and peace the curse
<>will not take effect, otherwise it will come true.” And
<>after making this announcement the sage returned to
<>the forest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 10).
<NI>9) {%The procession.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were staying
<>in the Ka1myaka forest Duryodhana and others went
<>there on the pretext of looking after the cows. The
<>Gandharvas took them captive; but the Pa1n2d2avas
<>intervened and set them free. Feeling humiliated at the
<>mishap Duryodhana decided to end his life after crown-
<>ing Dus4s4a1sana as King. But Dus4s4a1sana did not agree
<>to the proposal. (For details see Ghos2aya1tra1).
<NI>10) {%Duryodhana's attempt at death and his trip to Pa1ta1la.%}
<>Humiliated at the procession thus and turning down
<>the advice of friends to return to the palace, Duryo-
<>dhana spread grass on the ground and lay down there
<>to die. As his death would spell disaster to the Da1navas
<>they decided to send him back to his palace for which
<>purpose they performed the Vaita1na sacrifice in Pa1ta1la.
<>While offering milk in the sacrificial fire a Ra1ks2asa
<>woman, Kr2tya1, arose therefrom, and at the instance
<>of the Da1navas she carried Duryodhana over to Pa1ta1la.
<>There they told him thus: “Oh Duryodhana, a part
<>of your body has been earned by us from S4iva by our
<>penance. That part of your body above the waist is
<>made of diamond. Therefore, arrows will not pierce
<>your body. Grieve not. Bhagadatta and other heroes
<>have been born to help you. Your great supporter
<>Karn2a is possessed of the soul of Naraka1sura.” These
<>words of the Da1navas instilled fresh hope in Duryo-
<>dhana, and he was taken back to his Kingdom by Kr2tya1.
<>This incident appeared as a dream to Duryodhana.
<>Bucking up confidence and courage again he returned
<>to Hastina1pura and continued to rule (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 252).
<NI>11) {%Duryodhana's Vis2n2u yajn5a.%} At this juncture Duryo-
<>dhana thought of performing a Ra1jasu1ya for which he
<>invited brahmins to the palace. After bestowing much
<>thought on the subject the brahmins pointed out that
<>there was no sanction for Duryodhana to conduct a
<>Ra1jasu1ya as his elders, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Dharmaputra
<>were still alive. At the same time they pointed out that [Page260-b+ 64]
<>there was another Yajn5a called Vis2n2u Yajn5a as efficaci-
<>ous as Ra1jasu1ya which Duryodhana was competent to
<>perform. Accordingly Duryodhana performed the Vis2n2u
<>yajn5a and earned reputation among evil monarchs.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 256, 257).
<NI>12) {%Boon from Durva1sas.%} Once Durva1sas accompanied
<>by his disciples, came to Duryodhana's palace, and
<>Duryodhana decided somehow or other to befriend and
<>use the mahars2i as a weapon against the Pa1n2d2avas. He
<>housed the mahars2i and his disciples in the palace for
<>a few days and pleased them by careful service at which
<>the mahars2i asked Duryodhana to request for any boon
<>he desired. And, Duryodhana asked the mahars2i to
<>visit the Pa1n2d2avas one day in the forest with his disciples
<>when they had finished taking their meals. The
<>mahars2i agreed. And, this was the period of time when
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 had received the aks2ayapa1tra from Su1rya.
<>Everyday the pa1tra would produce enough food for the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the other people with them, but it would
<>become empty for the day after Pa1n5ca1li1 had eaten her
<>food. This was the nature of the aks2ayapa1tra.
<NI>Pa1n5ca1li1 had finished her meals one day when Durva1sas
<>and his disciples came to the Pa1n2d2avas. Not knowing
<>that Pa1n5ca1li1 had already finished her food Dharma-
<>putra welcomed the mahars2i and his disciples and
<>requested them to take bath in the Gan3ga1 and return for
<>their meals. Pa1n5ca1li1 was in a fix. The aks2ayapa1tra
<>would not produce any more food for the day, and if
<>not duly fed the mahars2i would get angry and curse
<>them. In this painful dilemma she prayed to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>for succour, and lo! he appeared and asked Pa1n5ca1li1 for
<>some food. She replied that the aks2ayapa1tra was quite
<>empty. But, Kr2s2n2a got from her the pa1tra and ate one
<>particle of Ki1ra (a leafy vegetable) which had stuck on
<>its side. That leafy substance fully satisfied his hunger
<>and thirst whereupon the hunger and thirst of Durva1sas
<>and his disciples were also quenched. Then Kr2s2n2a
<>asked Sahadeva to bring back the mahars2i and his
<>disciples from the bank of the Gan3ga1 and accordingly
<>he went there and invited them. Only a few minutes
<>had passed since the mahars2i and his disciples had felt
<>the satisfaction of a sumptuous meal. They were also
<>astonished to think how in such a short time food for so
<>many people could be cooked by Pa1n5ca1li1. They felt
<>rather anxious about the reaction which Dharmaputra
<>would evince in case they returned to him to say that
<>they required no food. Durva1sas realised only too well
<>that to quarrel with the Pa1n2d2avas, who enjoyed the
<>friendship and support of Kr2s2n2a was like playing with
<>fire. Therefore, the mahars2i with his disciples ran away
<>from the place secretly. Pa1n2d2avas waited long for the
<>mahars2i and his disciples to return fearing that the object
<>of Durva1sas might be to return at the untimely hour
<>and curse them. But, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a told them the details
<>about the mahars2i's departure and assured Dharma-
<>putra that he and his disciples would not return. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 263).
<NI>13) {%War against Vira1t2a.%} After twelve years' exile in the
<>forest the Pa1n2d2avas began their life incogni to at Vira1t2a
<>nagara. Ki1caka, brother-in-law of Ma1tsya, the Vira1t2a
<>King, was killed secretly by Bhi1masena, and news was
<>spread that Ki1caka was killed by a Gandharva.
<NI>None of the spies deputed by Duryodhana to spot out
<>the Pa1n2d2avas during their life incognito could gather [Page261-a+ 65]
<>any information about them. One of those days
<>Sus4arman, King of Trigarta, told Duryodhana that the
<>Vira1t2a King had lost his power and spirits due to the
<>death of Ki1caka and it was, therefore, the proper time
<>to attack the Vira1t2a country and subjugate it thor-
<>oughly. The idea appealed to Karn2a, who prompted
<>Duryodhana to war against Vira1t2a. The army was
<>fully mobilised. As an excuse for the war, at the ins-
<>tance of Duryodhana, Sus4arman, King of Trigarta
<>lifted innumerable cows of the Vira1t2a King. This
<>happened on the day on which the life incognito of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas was to have ended. And war started thus.
<>The Vira1t2a prince Uttara who spent his time in the
<>zenana in the palace appeared in the field of war.
<>Arjuna, under the assumed name of Br2hannala took up
<>the charioteership of Uttara. But, at the sight of the
<>vast Kaurava army Uttara fainted, and Arjuna hurried-
<>ly drove the chariot over to where his bow ga1n2d2i1va
<>was kept hidden, and with the bow in his hands Arjuna
<>jumped into the thick of the fight. A fierce war ensued
<>in which the Kaurava army was completely routed.
<>The life incognito of the Pa1n2d2avas was also over, and
<>Duryodhana became naturally anxious about the future
<>of things. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>14) {%Preparation for war.%} Duryodhana refused to give
<>the Pa1n2davas, even after their return from twelve years'
<>exile in forest and one year's life incognito, even ‘as much
<>land as would hold a pin’, and war became inevitable.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas fought the great war which
<>lasted for eighteen days on the field of Kuruks2etra.
<NI>(1) {%Duryodhana went to invite S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Preparations for
<>the war were gathering speed and momentum. Both
<>the sides were on the look out for more friends and
<>allies. Being told that Arjuna had gone to Dva1raka1 to
<>seek Kr2s2n2a's support Duryodhana rushed to the place.
<>Seeing Duryodhana from a distance Kr2s2n2a lay on his
<>bed in a false sleep, and Duryodhana took his seat
<>on a stool at the head of the bed awaiting Kr2s2n2a to
<>awake from sleep. Soon after, Arjuna came there and
<>he stood at the feet of Kr2s2n2a with head bowed down.
<>When Kr2s2n2a awoke from sleep it was Arjuna whom he
<>saw first, and while exchanging greetings with Arjuna
<>he was told that it was Duryodhana, who had come
<>first. But when Duryodhana and Arjuna explained the
<>object of their visit he told them thus:--
<NI>“No doubt it was Duryodhana who came first. But, it
<>was Arjuna whom I met first. Since Duryodhana came
<>first and I saw Arjuna first I shall help both of you in
<>war. There is the adage that youngsters should be
<>given priority of consideration. So, Arjuna may indi-
<>cate his preference first. I shall give one of you an army
<>of 10 lakhs of warrlors as strong in body as myself,
<>and I shall stand by the other without arms and with-
<>out fighting. Arjuna may make his choice first. And,
<>he chose Kr2s2n2a for his side in the war while Duryodhana
<>was happy to get Kr2s2n2a's mighty army. (M.B. Udyoga-
<>Parva, Chapter 7).
<NI>(2) Duryodhana sought Balabhadra's help but Bala-
<>bhadra told him frankly that since he could not forsake
<>Kr2s2n2a he would remain neutral in the war. (M. B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 25).
<NI>(3) Duryodhana got an aks2auhin2i1 (a specific division of
<>army) from Kr2tavarman. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7,
<>Verse 32).
<NI>(4) S4alya promised to captain the Kaurava army. [Page261-b+ 65]
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 18).
<NI>(5) Duryodhana could collect a total of eleven aks2a-
<>uhin2i1s. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 27).
<NI>(6) He assured Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that the Kaurava army
<>would easily defeat the Pa1n2d2ava army. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 57).
<NI>(7) He declared that war was a yajn5a. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(8) At the instance of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra a rest house was
<>built for S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a on his way to the Kauravas for
<>compromise talks on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 85).
<NI>(9) Duryodhana opined that Kr2s2n2a be taken captive
<>when he came to plead for compromise and peace,
<>but the others did not support him. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Verse 13).
<NI>(10) Duryodhana worshipped Kr2s2n2a with rare and
<>excellent things and invited him for meals, but Kr2s2n2a
<>did not accept any. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>91, Verse 13).
<NI>(11) Duryodhana rejected the advice of sage Kan2va
<>to come to terms with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapters 97-105).
<NI>(12) He emphatically announced in the Kaurava
<>assembly that even as much land as may be required
<>to hold a pin would not be given to the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 26).
<NI>(13) Kr2s2n2a's pleadings in the Kaurava assembly for
<>peace and amity on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas failed to
<>have any effect. On the occasion Duryodhana, S4akuni,
<>Karn2a and Dus4s4a1sana conspired to take Kr2s2n2a captive.
<>Sa1tyaki informed Kr2s2n2a secretly about the conspiracy
<>and Kr2s2n2a informed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra about it, and he
<>warned the conspirators against their wicked plan.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 13, Verse 4).
<NI>(14) Duryodhana appointed Kr2pa, Dron2a, S4alya,
<>Jayadratha, Ha1rdika, As4vattha1ma1, Karn2a, S4akuni,
<>Ba1lhi1ka and Ka1mboja as commanders of the army.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 155).
<NI>(15) Duryodhana appointed Bhi1s2ma as the Commander
<>in-Chief of the army. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156
<>verse 26).
<NI>(16) He appointed Ulu1ka as messenger and warned
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, the Pa1n2d2avas, Drupada, Vira1t2a, S4ikhan2d2i1,

<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 195).
<NI>(18) He appointed Dus4s4a1sana as Bhi1s2ma's body-guard.

<NI>(19) On the flag staff of Duryodhana studded with gems
<>his flag with the serpent's emblem flew high in the air.

<HI>DUS4S4A1SANA II. Another Dus4s4a1sana, servant of the
<>son of King Khad2gaba1hu of Saura1s2t2ra is also mentioned
<>in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Khad2gaba1hu had a famous elephant, which one night
<>broke its chains and escaped, and all the mahouts
<>could not chain it again. People in terror of the elephant
<>ran helter-skelter. Now, a brahmin was going that way
<>chanting verses of the 16th Chapter of the Gi1ta1, and even
<>though the mahouts warned him he did not change
<>his path. Instead he saluted the elephant by touching
<>its cheeks and proceeded on his way unhurt by the ani-
<>mal. The King felt great respect for the brahmin when
<>he was told that he owed his miraculous powers to
<>the 16th chapter of the Gi1ta1, and he took the brahmin
<>with him to his palace. The King gave him 100,000 golden
<>coins and received from him the Gi1ta1 mantra. He began
<>reciting daily certain verses in the 16th Chapter of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some time afterwards the King one day went to an
<>open ground near his palace accompanied by soldi-
<>ers and set the elephant free from its chain. Then,
<>unheeding the entreaties of the frightened people he
<>approached the elephant, saluted it by touching its
<>cheeks and came away unhurt. He could act in this
<>fashion because of his firm faith in the efficacy of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1. And afterwards he placed his son, on the
<>throne and himself led a life of recluse repeating the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some Pura1n2as have another version of this episode.
<>Dus4s4a1sana was a servant of Khad2gaba1hu's son and he
<>attempted to catch the elephant but was killed
<>by it. He attained salvation by hearing the 17th Chap-
<>ter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Dus4s4a1sana, an idiot, betting a huge sum of money with
<>the junior mahouts of the elephant and unheeding the
<>warnings of several people once mounted the elephant.
<>Children agitated the animal and Dus4s4a1sana fell down
<>from its back. The angry animal stamped the fool to [Page264-b+ 64]
<>death, and its rage having not yet subsided it threw
<>around his bones. Dus4s4a1sana, who ended his life thus
<>was reborn as an elephant and was owned by King
<>Jayadeva of Ceylon for a long time. A great friend of
<>King Khad2gaba1hu, Jayadeva presented the elephant
<>to him. At the sight of its brothers and other relations
<>memory about its previous birth dawned on the eleph-
<>ant. And, it lived in great grief. After some days the
<>King presented the animal to a poet pleased at his
<>samasya1pu1ran2a (filling the three lines of a stanza in
<>tune with the fourth line given). The poet sold the
<>elephant to the King of Ma1lava as it got ill with
<>fever. In spite of the best treatment administered to it
<>the elephant seemed to be nearing its end. Without
<>either eating or drinking or sleeping the animal stood
<>motionless shedding tears day and night. One
<>day, the Ma1lava King visited the elephant when,
<>to the surprise of all assembled there, the elephant
<>spoke to the King thus: “Oh, King: if a brahmin
<>recites the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1 I will
<>be completely cured of my illness.”
<NI>Accordingly a brahmin was brought. As soon as he
<>chanted the Gi1ta1 and sprinkled water on its head it
<>got rid of its animalhood, ascended the divine aero-
<>plane and shone forth like Indra. The Ma1lava King
<>also began daily reciting the Bhagavadgi1ta1 and within a
<>short time afterwards attained salvation. (Padma

<>husband, on top of the ceiling of her room. He killed
<>Devada1sa while the latter was sleeping in the night.
<>Next day when people gathered at her house she gave

<NI>Once King Maha1bali, with a vast army of Asuras, went
<>to the realm of the gods and drove them out of heaven.
<>Aditi was much grieved at the misfortune that befell
<>her sons. Kas4yapa her husband asked her the cause of
<>her grief. She told him about the fall of gods, and
<>asked him for a remedy. Kas4yapa told her to observe
<>Dva1das4i1vrata. Aditi took Dva1das4i1vrata and Maha1bali
<>was pushed down to Pa1ta1la by Maha1vis2n2u who
<>incarnated as Va1mana. From that day onwards
<>Dva1das4i1vrata is considered to be holy fast. (Bha1gavata,

<>Dvaidhi1bha1va is dividing his army into two, i.e. if the [Page266-a+ 63]
<>army rose against the King, he should bring one party

<>under S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, and built a strong city in the western
<>islands. That beautiful city was called Dva1raka1. Kus4a-
<>sthali1, is another name of this city. The beautiful
<>mountain Raivataka stood as a fortress round the city
<>which was so strongly built that it was not possible
<>even for the gods to enter it. Even women could fight
<>sitting inside the forts. The fortress Raivataka was three
<>yojanas long. In each yojana three divisions of the

<>strictly and continuously the Eka1das4i1 Vrata to obtain

<>Skandha, Bha1gavata). This vrata would fetch food
<>for the hungry and salvation for those who are in
<>search of it. (Agni Pura1n2a). The method of observing
<>this vrata is detailed below:
<NI>Those who observe the Eka1das4i1 vrata should be on a
<>regulated diet excluding meat and avoid sexual acts
<>on the Das4ami1 day, the day preceding Eka1das4i1. On
<>both the Eka1das4i1 days in a month one should not take
<>any food at all. The period which combines Eka1das4i1
<>with Dva1das4i1 (the twelfth day) is called Hariva1sara
<>because of the presence of Vis2n2u at that time. That
<>is a good time for doing sacred yajn5as. That day where
<>there is only a small portion of Eka1das4i1 and the rest
<>Dva1dasi1 is the best day for yajn5as. Trayodas4i1 (the
<>thirteenth day) is good for breaking the fast. The day
<>which merges Dva1das4i1 into Trayodas4i1 is the best day
<>for breaking the fast. Do not observe the Vrata on a
<>day which combines Das4ami1 with Eka1das4i1. Hell is the
<>result if one does so.
<NI>Completely abstaining from food on the Eka1das4i1 day
<>you should take food on the Dva1das4i1 day. As you take
<>your food you should pray like this: “Bhun3ks2yeham3
<>Pun2d2ari1ka1ks2a s4aran2am3 me bhava1cyuta”. (Oh, Pun2d2a-
<>ri1ka1ks2a, I am going to break my fast. Oh, Bhagavan,
<>let you be my heaven). If an Eka1das4i1 comes on a
<>Pu1yam3--Pus2ya--day in the bright half of the month that
<>day should on any account be observed. That day would
<>give the observer unlimited good result and that
<>Eka1das4i1 is qualified as Pa1pana1s4ini1 (destroyer of all
<>evils). When Eka1das4i1 and Dva1das4i1 happen to combine
<>on a Tiruvon2am (S4ra1van2a) day the Eka1das4i1 is qualified
<>as Vijaya1. That day gives prosperity to devotees. It is
<>also called Vijaya1 if an Eka1das4i1 comes in the month
<>of Pha1lguna (March) on a Pu1yam3 (Pus2ya) day. The
<>wise extol this day as one promising crores of good effects.
<>On the Eka1das4i1 day you should do Vis2n2u Pu1ja1 which
<>is productive of universal happiness. He who does so
<>will acquire children and wealth in this world and
<>attain Vis2n2uloka on death. (Chapter 178, Agni
<>Pura1n2a)
<HI>EKA1DAS4ENDRIYA(S). S4rotra, Tvak, Caks2us, Jihva1,

<>made a replica of the preceptor in clay and standing
<>before it started practising archery. Soon he became a
<>matchless archer.
<NI>Some time later the Pa1n2d2avas went to the forests for
<>hunting. One of the hunting dogs wandering saw

<>arrows to its mouth and kept it open. When the dog
<>returned to Arjuna he was dumbfounded at the skill
<>of the archer and when he came to know the archer
<>was an unknown disciple of Dron2a his disappointment
<>knew no bounds. Dron2a had once declared that Arjuna
<>was the best and topmost of his disciples. Arjuna went
<>and complained to Dron2a1ca1rya. Dron2a1ca1rya called
<>Ekalavya to his side and asked him to give him as
<>‘Gurudaks2in2a1’ (fee to the preceptor) his right-hand
<>thumb. Without the least hesitation Ekalavya offered
<>his thumb to the guru and from that day onwards his
<>skill faded and he became inferior to Arjuna. (Chapter

<>bha1rata. When Gautama died Trita became the chief of
<>the three. Dvita and Ekata did not like this. Once all
<>the three were passing by a forest with a herd of cows for
<>a ya1ga. Trita was walking ahead and the other two were
<>following him with the cows. At a strategic point on the
<>way the brothers carried away the cows by a separate
<>route without the knowledge of Trita. When Trita
<>came to know of the loss he was greatly distressed. On
<>reaching the shores of the river Sarasvati1, he was frigh-
<>tened by a wolf and running to escape from the animal
<>fell into a dilapidated well. He performed a ya1ga from
<>where he lay. Assuming a creeper inside the well to be
<>Somalata1, Trita recited the R2ks and the devas responded
<>to his prayer. Devas like Br2haspati graciously appeared
<>before him and asked him to demand a boon from
<>them. Trita replied that his desire was to worship the
<>gods standing on the waves of the river Sarasvati1.
<>Accordingly the river was made to flow that way and
<>standing on the waves Trita worshipped the gods. After
<>that he went home and cursed his brothers and made
<>Ekata and Dvita into wolves.

<HI>EKAVI1RA
<F>1. The genealogy of Ekavi1ra is stated differently in different Pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata states that Ekavi1ra is the son of Turvasu,
<>son of Yaya1ti and that he is the father of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. It is not correct. The genealogy chronicled here is based on Agni and Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2as. According to that Yadu, son of Yaya1ti is the father of the grandfather of Ekavi1ra: Yadu--Sahasrajit--Satajit--Hehaya (Ekavi1ra).
<>Descending from Ekavi1ra--Dharma--Kun2i--Bhadrasena--Dhanaka--Krtavi1ra--Ka1rtavi1rva1rjuna. From the grandson of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna,
<>Vr2s2n2i, starts the Vr2s2n2i dynasty.</F> (HEHAYA). A founder of the Hehaya
<>line of kings.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u: Atri--
<>Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Yaya1ti--Yadu--
<>Sahasrajit--S4atajit--Ekavi1ra (Hehaya).
<NI>2) {%Birth of Ekavi1ra.%} Once there was a King called
<>Revanta who was an intimate friend of Indra. One day
<>riding on Uccaih2s4ravas, Indra's horse, he went to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. Fascinated by the arresting beauty of
<>Revanta, Maha1laks2mi1 sat gaping for a while and did
<>not hear what Vis2n2u talked to her. Vis2n2u was offended
<>and lost his temper. Laks2mi1 was looking with interest
<>alternatively at Revanta and the horse when Vis2n2u
<>cursed her to be born as a mare on earth. Horrified,
<>shedding tears, Laks2mi1 begged for relief. Vis2n2u decreed
<>that she would return to Vaikun2t2ha after giving birth
<>to a son who would be equal in glory to Vis2n2u himself.
<>Maha1laks2mi1 came to Earth taking the shape of a mare
<>and lived in a forest situated at a point where the rivers
<>Ka1lindi1 and Tamasa1 meet and where once Su1ryapatni1
<>stayed and did penance. Meditating on S4iva she lived
<>there for a thousand divine years and then one day
<>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 appeared before her and asked her
<>what she wanted. She then said “Oh, Bhagavan, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u cursed me and made me into a mare. He has
<>decreed that I would go back after bringing forth a son
<>as glorious as Vis2n2u. From whom am I to bear a son
<>like this?” S4iva promised to find a solution and going to
<>Vaikun2t2ha sent Vis2n2u to earth in the form of a horse.
<>Vis2n2u came to Laks2mi1 and they lived together for some
<>time and soon a son was born to Laks2mi1. Leaving the
<>child in the forest both of them went back to Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. It is this child who later on became the famous
<>King, Ekavi1ra. It was because he was born of a horse
<>that he got the names, Hehaya and Haihaya. (Skandha
<>6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How Ekavi1ra came to the palace.%} It was at this time that
<>S4atajit, son of the grandson of Yaya1ti was doing
<>penance to obtain a son. He was also doing penance
<>in the forest situated at a point where the rivers Ka1lindi1
<>and Tamasa1 meet. One night a Vidya1dhara named
<>Campaka came with a Vidya1dhari1 named Mada1lasa1
<>and seeing the infant lying helpless in the forest took
<>it to Devaloka. Indra recognised it as the child born to
<>Vis2n2u and Laks2mi1 on earth while they were living as
<>horse and mare and so the Vidya1dhara put it back on
<>earth in the same place as before. Immediately Laks2mi1-
<>Na1ra1yan2as appeared before S4atajit doing penance there
<>and asking him to take care of a child lying helpless in
<>another side of the forest disappeared. Immensely
<>pleased at this S4atajit took the child to his palace and
<>brought him forth as his own son giving the child the
<>name Ekavi1ra. When the boy became a prince, S4atajit
<>crowned Ekavi1ra King and went to the forest with his
<>queen and after doing penance there for sometime
<>attained Vis2n2uloka. (Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Ekavi1ra marries Eka1vali1.%} Once Prince Ekavi1ra
<>accompanied by the son of the minister went for a plea-
<>sure trip to the banks of the river Gan3ga1. It was spring
<>and the prince wandering about enjoying the sight of a [Page269-b+ 60]
<>flowery forest was soon arrested by the sight of a
<>sweet smelling lotus with a hundred petals blooming in
<>the river. By the side of the lotus was standing a
<>beautiful damsel weeping. The prince went to her and
<>asked her the reason for her weeping. After great per-
<>suasion she replied thus: “Oh, Prince, there is a country
<>not far from yours which is now being ruled over by a
<>very righteous King called Raibhya. His queen is called
<>Rukmarekha1. They had no children for a very long
<>time and so Raibhya conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i ya1ga.
<>When ghee was poured profusely into the sacrificial fire
<>the flames rose up to great heights and from inside the
<>flames came out a lovely maiden. The King named her
<>Eka1vali1 and bought her forth as his daughter. I am
<>Yas4ovati1 the daughter of the minister there. We were
<>of the same age and so I was asked to live with her as
<>her companion. She was very fond of lotuses and the
<>King constructed big ponds with lotuses in them for
<>her recreation. Yet she used to go to other ponds also
<>in search of lotuses.
<NI>One day we came to this side of the river Gan3ga1 to
<>play. Then a demon of name Ka1laketu came and kidnapp-
<>ed her. I followed her. She never surrendered to the
<>enticements and persuasions of Ka1laketu. Her father
<>wanted her to be married to Ekavi1ra, King of Hehaya.
<>Ka1laketu sent her to prison. Without knowing what to
<>do next I am standing here weeping.
<NI>Hearing this Ekavi1ra went to Pa1ta1la and defeating
<>Ka1laketu released Eka1vali1 and brought both Eka1vali1
<>and Yas4ovati1 to the palace of Raibhya. Pleased at this
<>Raibhya gave his daughter in marriage to Ekavi1ra.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was born in the family of Ekavi1ra.

<HI>ELA1PUTRA. A serpent born to Kas4yapa of his wife
<>Kadru1. This serpent was very intelligent. Once there
<>arose a dispute between Vinata1 and Kadru1 over the
<>colour of the tail of the horse of Indra, Uccaih2s4ravas.
<>Kadru1 argued that there were black hairs in the tail
<>while Vinata1 held there were none. Really there were
<>no black hairs and Kadru1 to win the argument wanted
<>her sons to go and hang on the hairs to create a black
<>colour. The serpents like Va1suki and others refused to
<>do so and Kadru1 then cursed them saying that they
<>would all be burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
<>Janamejaya. To take measures to get free from this
<>curse a meeting of the serpents under the leadership of
<>S4es2a and Va1suki was held and in that assembly Ela1-
<>putra made a stirring speech. (Chapter 38, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>ELI AND PU1CCA. (Eli = rat, Pu1cca = Cat).
<NI>The story of the cat and the rat described by the poet
<>Kun5jan Nambia1r is from Katha1saritsa1gara. The story
<>in original is the following.
<NI>Once there lived on a big banyan tree near the city of
<>Vidis4a1 a mongoose, an owl, a cat and a rat. The mon-
<>goose and the rat lived in two separate hollows at the
<>foot of the tree, the cat in a cavity in the centre of the
<>tree and the owl on the branches at the top. Of these
<>the rat could be eaten by all the other three and the cat
<>could kill all the rest. The rat and the mongoose afraid [Page270-a+ 64]
<>of the cat did stir out only during night time and the
<>cat moved about day and night afraid of none wishing
<>to catch hold of the rat and eat it. Their common place
<>of activity was a rice-field nearby.
<NI>Once a forester laid a net to catch the cat and the cat
<>fell into the trap and lay there hanging inside the net.
<>The rat coming that way saw the plight of the cat and
<>jumped with joy. But soon the owl and the mongoose
<>came to the spot and seeing their enemy, the cat, impr2i-
<>soned rushed to catch hold of the rat. The rat then did
<>a very clever thing. It went and tore open the net
<>imprisoning the cat and when the cat jumped out of the
<>net the owl and the mongoose ran away and disappear-
<>ed. The rat went to its hole. This is a story to
<>demonstrate the fact that with a change in the situation
<>an enemy may turn out to be a friend. (Taran3ga 7,
<>Madanaman5cuka1lam3baka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>ELLU. An oil seed. (Sesame). Ellu originated from
<>the body of Kas4yapa. Because Ellu is born of the body
<>of Kas4yapa, King of R2s2is, it is considered as divine to
<>offer Ellu to anybody. (S4loka 10, Chapter 66, Anus4a1-

<NI>2) {%How he got his name.%} There is no record of his origi-
<>nal name in any of the Pura1n2as. He got his name
<>Ga1lava later. There is a story about this both in Devi1-
<>bha1gavata and Harivam3s4a. It is as follows:
<NI>There was once a King called Arun2a in the family of
<>Ma1ndha1ta1. Arun2a got a son and he was named Satya-
<>vrata. (It was this Satyavrata who later became the well
<>famed Tris4an3ku). When Satyavrata was a youngster
<>he once went inside the marriage hall of a brahmin and
<>kidnapped the bride. Furious at this evil deed of his
<>son the king sent him out from his palace and Satyavrata
<>roamed about aimlessly.
<NI>Nature protested against this deed of the King abandon-
<>ing his heir and there was no rain in the country for
<>twelve years. The people were all put to great trouble.
<>Among those who suffered were the wife and children
<>of Vis4va1mitra. Vis4va1mitra had at that time gone to
<>the shores of the river Kaus4iki1, for doing penance. The
<>family of Vis4va1mitra was in great distress living without
<>any means for food. The sight of the children crying
<>for food to appease their hunger pained their mother
<>much. So she decided to sell one child and feed the
<>others by what she got from the sale. It was better to
<>be without one child than all the children dying out of
<>hunger.
<NI>She made a rope out of darbha leaves and tying it round
<>the neck of one child took it to the market for sale.
<>Both the mother and child were weeping profusely on
<>their way. Satyavrata saw them and took pity on them.
<>When Satyavrata heard their sad story and knew that
<>the woman was the wife of Vis4va1mitra he told her
<>thus: “Oh, Venerable Lady, you need not sell this boy.
<>Untie the rope round his neck and throw it away. I
<>will look after your family till the return of your hus-
<>band. I will daily bring food for you all and hang it
<>on a tree near your a1s4rama.”
<NI>The mother was extremely happy to hear this and she
<>at once untied the rope round the neck of the boy and
<>the boy from thence became known as Ga1lava. (For
<>details see under Tris4an3ku).
<NI>3) {%Gurudaks2in2a1 of Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava continued his educa-

<>test Vis4va1mitra came to him disguised as Vasis2t2ha.
<>Vis4va1mitra came out with rice to receive the guest but
<>by that time the guest had disappeared. But Vis4va1-
<>mitra remained there with the rice for hundred years
<>till Dharmadeva returned. All these years Ga1lava looked
<>after Vis4va1mitra's comforts. Vis4va1mitra was immensely
<>pleased with Ga1lava and allowed him to go away free
<>without any gurudaks2in2a1 when his education was over.
<>Ga1lava wanted to give some daks2in2a1 but Vis4va1mitra
<>refused to accept it. Ga1lava insisted on giving and then
<>Vis4va1mitra asked him to give whatever he liked but
<>Ga1lava wanted the Daks2in2a1 to be named. Disgusted
<>with this stubbornness Vis4va1mitra said “Go and get me
<>eight hundred horses each with one of its ears black”.
<>Ga1lava was shocked to hear the demand and greatly
<>worried roamed about in search of horses of the type
<>specified. Garud2a taking pity on his sad plight took
<>him to the palace of Yaya1ti. Hearing the story of
<>Ga1lava Yaya1ti sent his daughter Ma1dhavi1 with Ga1lava
<>saying that if she was given in marriage to any king he
<>would give him the eight hundred horses of the type
<>he required.
<NI>Ga1lava took Ma1dhavi1 to Haryas4va, a King of the
<>Iks2va1ku line of Kings. Haryas4va was doing penance
<>at that time to obtain a child. Ga1lava said that Har-
<>yas4va would get a son of Ma1dhavi1 and he should,
<>therefore, accept Ma1dhavi1 and give him in return eight
<>hundred horses each with one ear black. Haryas4va was
<>amenable to the terms but the only difficulty was that
<>he had only two hundred horses of the type specified.
<>Finding this difficulty Ma1dhavi1 said “Oh, Ga1lava
<>please do not worry on that account. I have a boon from
<>a brahmava1di1 sage that I would remain a maiden
<>even after delivery. So give me in marriage to this
<>King and get two hundred horses. After giving birth
<>to a son to this King take me to another King and
<>get two hundred horses from him and then to another and
<>thus by giving me to four Kings you can get the eight
<>hundred horses you require.”
<NI>Ga1lava liked this plan and so when Ma1dhavi1 gave
<>birth to a son he took her to Divoda1sa, Ra1ja1 of Ka1s4i1.
<>When a son was born to him Ga1lava took her to Us4i1nara,
<>King of Bhoja. Ga1lava thus got six hundred horses but
<>there was nobody else to give him the remaining two
<>hundred. When Ga1lava was contemplating as to what
<>he should do next Garud2a came to his rescue. He
<>advised Ga1lava to give six hundred horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses to Vis4va1-
<>mitra. Ga1lava gave Vis4va1mitra the horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>and pleased with the gurudaks2in2a1 Vis4va1mitra
<>blessed Ga1lava. Vis4va1mitra got a son named As2t2aka
<>of Madhavi1. (See under As2t2aka).
<NI>4) {%Ga1lava and Citrasena.%} Ga1lava was once having his even-
<>ing prayers in the river when the spittings from the mouth
<>of Citrasena who was travelling by air above fell on
<>the pu1ja1 materials of Ga1lava. Ga1lava went and com-
<>plained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of this and Kr2s2n2a in haste pro-
<>mised to bring before Ga1lava the head of Citrasena
<>before the sun set. Na1rada who heard this went and
<>informed Citrasena of Kr2s2n2a's vow. Citrasena was
<>frightened to death. But Na1rada asked him not to lose
<>hope and advised Sandhya1 and Vali1, wives of Citra-
<>sena, to approach Subhadra1, sister of Kr2s2n2a, for pro-
<>tection. Both of them went to Subhadra1 and made a [Page272-b+ 64]
<>grand fire-pit in front of her palace. Citrasena decided
<>to end his life by jumping into the fire and as he was
<>circling the pit his wives wept loudly. Since her hus-
<>band Arjuna was away from the palace Subhadra1 her-
<>self ran to the place from where she heard the cries.
<>When they saw Subhadra1 they begged for ‘Man3galya-
<>bhiks2a1’ (a boon to live with one's husband). Subhadra1
<>agreed to give them that. Then she heard their story
<>in full and only then did she realise that she had under-
<>taken to do the impossible. Yet, to help Subhadra1,
<>Arjuna agreed to protect Citrasena. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>attacked Citrasena Arjuna defended. The fight then
<>ensued between Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a. Both had very
<>powerful and divine weapons and the world stood on
<>the verge of a collapse by their fight. Then Subhadra1
<>did a brave thing. She stood between the two and
<>requested for a cease-fire. Then S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a asked Citra-
<>sena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava. Ga1lava
<>pardoned him. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Tapoda1na.%} Ga1lava once gave Yaya1ti one eighth
<>portion of the goodness accrued to him by his long
<>penance. (See Yaya1ti for details).
<NI>6) {%Ga1lava gets a horse.%} Pa1ta1laketu, a demon, used to
<>give trouble to Ga1lava daily while he used to do
<>penance. Once this demon sent a deep hot breath to
<>the sky and then a horse fell from the sky. Soon an
<>unknown voice from air said, “This is a very strong
<>horse and it would travel many a yojana in an hour.”
<>Ga1lava took that horse and gave it to R2tadhvaja.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 59).
<NI>7) {%Other details regarding Ga1lava.%}
<NI>(i) He was an intimate friend of King Prati1pa. (S4loka
<>13, Chapter 20, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>(ii) He was a shining member of the court of Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira. (S4loka 15, Chapter 4, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iii) He shone in the court of Indra. (S4loka 10, Chap-
<>ter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iv) He conducted a discussion with Na1rada on the
<>true nature of real prosperity. (S4loka 5, Chapter 287,
<>S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(v) On another occasion he spoke to Dharmaputra on
<>the glory of the universe. (S4loka 52, Chapter 18,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vi) He swore before God to prove his innocence in
<>the lotus-theft involving Agastya. (S4loka 37, Chapter
<>94, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vii) S4r2n3gava who married Vr2ddhakanya1 was a son of
<>Ga1lava. (S4loka 14, Chapter 52, S4alya Parva). For
<>details see under Vis4vakarma1.
<HI>GAM. Music. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 348).
<HI>GAN2A1. A female attendant of Skanda. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 46, Verse 3).
<HI>GAN2AM. An army division. Three Gulmas form one
<>Gan2am. (See Aks2auhin2i1).
<HI>GAN2APATI.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A son of S4iva with face like that of an
<>elephant. As S4iva has appointed this son as chief of
<>the gan2as (attendants) he is called Gan2apati.
<NI>2) {%His birth.%} While S4iva and Pa1rvati1 assumed the form
<>of monkeys and enjoyed themselves in the forest Pa1rvati1
<>got pregnant, and S4iva took the semen from the womb
<>and gave it to Va1yu (wind God.) Va1yu deposited it in
<>the womb of An5jana1, who delivered a son named Hanu1-
<>ma1n. S4iva assumed the form of an elephant (tusker) [Page273-a+ 64]
<>and Pa1rvati1 that of a she-elephant. Pa1rvati1 delivered a
<>son in the form of an elephant. That son was named
<>Gan2apati. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%His tusk broken.%} Once Paras4ura1ma arrived at Kaila1sa
<>to meet S4iva. At that time S4iva was asleep. So Gan2a-
<>pati did not allow him to get in. A duel broke out
<>between them. In that duel one of Gan2apati's tusks
<>was broken. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%Gan2apati turned into crow.%} An exceptionally hot
<>summer set in once in South India. The whole land
<>became parched. So Agastya went to S4iva and request-
<>ed for some holy water, and the Lord put Ka1veri1 who
<>was worshipping him just then, in the Kaman2d2alu
<>(something like a teapot which sannya1sins carry with
<>them) of Agastya and sent him back. Indra, who did
<>not relish this action of S4iva, asked Gan2apati to some
<>how or other upset Agastya's Kaman2d2alu of holy water,
<>and Gan2apati, in the guise of a crow went and sat on
<>the brink of the Kaman2d2alu and thus upset it. Agastya
<>and the crow quarrelled with each other. Then did the
<>crow assume its original form as Gan2apati and blessed
<>Agastya. Moreover, Gan2apati filled Agastya's Kaman2-
<>d2alu with holy water, which the latter distributed
<>among devotees in South India, and that is the present
<>Ka1veri1 river.
<NI>5) {%Other stories about Gan2apati's head.%} The Pura1n2as
<>contain two different stories as to how Gan2apati hap-
<>pened to have the elephant's head. Once Pa1rvati1
<>pointed out to Gan2apati the planet Saturn, and his head
<>got burned down due to the ocular power of Saturn,
<>and according to one story Gan2apati's head thus lost
<>was replaced with that of an elephant. The other story
<>is more interesting. When once S4iva tried to enter the
<>room where Pa1rvati1 had gone to take her bath clad in
<>a single clothing Gan2apati prevented S4iva from doing
<>so. S4iva, enraged at the obstruction made by Gan2apati,
<>cut off his head, and when his anger was cooled down
<>he replaced Gan2apati's lost head with that of an ele-
<>phant. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%Wedding of Gan2apati.%} Gan2apati has two wives called
<>Siddhi and Buddhi.
<NI>When Gan2apati and Subrahman2ya attained the age of
<>marriage they were in a hurry to get married. S4iva
<>conducted a test. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 told them that he
<>who returned first after going round the world would be
<>married first. Accordingly Subrahman2ya mounted his
<>vehicle (peacock) and set out for a tour round the
<>world. Gan2apati did nothing of the sort. But after a
<>little time he went round his parents, viz., S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1. Asked for an explanation about his action
<>Gan2apati replied that since the whole universe existed
<>in S4iva and Pa1rvati1, going around them tantamounted
<>to touring round the world. Pleased at this reply his
<>parents got Gan2apati married first.
<NI>7) {%Vighnes4varatvam.%} (Power to remove all obstacles).
<>Gan2apati is called Vighnes4vara because he is the god
<>who removes all obstacles from the paths of men or
<>creates them.
<NI>Gan2apati has the power to get anything done without
<>any obstructions as also the power to put obstacles in
<>the path of anything being got done. Therefore, the
<>custom came into vogue of worshipping Gan2apati at the
<>very commencement of any action for its completion
<>without any hitch or hindrance. Actions begun with [Page273-b+ 64]
<>such worship would be duly completed, Indians believe.
<>In support of that belief the following story from the
<>6th taran3ga of La1va1n2akalam3bakam, Katha1saritsa1gara
<>may be quoted.
<NI>The Devas decided to appoint Subrahman2ya as chief
<>of the army to kill Ta1raka1sura. When Indra took up
<>the pot of water purified by mantras to anoint Subrah-
<>man2ya's head with it, his hands became benumbed, and
<>he stood aghast. Then S4iva said that any action begun
<>without Gan2apati pu1ja1 would meet with such obstacles.
<>At once Indra worshipped Gan2apati and his hands
<>recovered from the paralysed condition. And, Subrah-
<>man2ya was duly anointed with the holy water.
<NI>8) {%Gan2apati wrote the M3aha1bha1rata.%} After the death of
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas sage Vya1sa entered
<>again into meditation. But, the whole story of the
<>Bha1rata reflected in the mirror of his mind. He wanted
<>to translate the story into a great poem and requested
<>Brahma1 to suggest a suitable person to write the story
<>on his dictation, and Brahma1 suggested Gan2apati's
<>name. Then Vya1sa thought about Gan2apati and he
<>appeared before the sage. But, Gan2apati did not appre-
<>ciate the idea of serving as Vya1sa's scribe. So he stipu-
<>lated a condition that he would write down the poem
<>provided Vya1sa dictated it in such a manner that he
<>had not to lay down his pen even once before the epic
<>was completed. To this Vya1sa stipulated the counter
<>condition that when he dictated without the least inter-
<>ruption or pause Gan2apati should not write down the
<>matter without understanding the meaning of it. And,
<>under such conditions the composition of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata was completed within three years. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verses 74-80).
<NI>9) {%Gan2apati pu1ja.%} Gan2apati occupies the most promi-
<>nent place among the Devas connected with S4iva. In
<>South India, Gan2apati pu1ja1 came into vogue in the 6th
<>century A.D., and idols of Gan2apati now extant might
<>have been made at that period. In South India, temples
<>dedicated to Gan2apati are in no way less in number
<>than those to Subrahman2ya. The idol of Gan2apati is
<>installed at the gateways of villages and forts, under
<>the fig tree, at the entrance of temples and at the south-
<>western corner of S4iva temples. Two types of idols are
<>important: the Itam3piri (the proboscis turned to the
<>left side) and the Valam3piri (the proboscis turned to
<>the right side). It is stated that the enormously big
<>belly of Gan2apati contains in it the whole universe.

<>Devas and the asuras about the Amr2tam (nectar) got
<>from the churning of Ks2i1ra1bdhi (the milk ocean) and
<>Maha1vis2n2u appeared in the form of Mohini1 and enti-
<>ced the asuras away from the subject and gave the
<>nectar to the Devas. Attracted by the great beauty of
<>Mohini1, S4iva made love to her, and the sweet produced
<>at the time of their embrace flowed as river Gan2d2aki
<>through the earth. (Skandha Pura1n2a, A1sura Khan2d2a).
<NI>3) {%It became a holy river.%} While the worms on the banks
<>of Gan2d2aki1 were once collecting soil they fell into the
<>river, and all at once they attained salvation, the reason
<>being that the water in the river had been formed by

<HI>GA1NDHA1RA. A stretch of land of ancient Bha1rata. It
<>is believed that this land stretched from the shores of
<>river Sindhu to Ka1bul. Subala was a mighty ruler of
<>this country. His daughter Ga1ndha1ri1 was the wife of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (S4loka 11, Chapter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>Agni Pura1n2a points out a relationship between the
<>Ga1ndha1ras and the Dra1vid2as. Descending in order from
<>Vis2n2u were Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a

<>Keralas, Colas, Pa1n2d2yas and Kolas. (Chapter 277,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1NDHA1RI1. Wife of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There was a King called Subala in the family
<>of Turvasu, brother of Yadu. (For genealogy see under
<>Subala). Subala became the King of the land of Ga1n-
<>dha1ra. This land extended from the river Sindhu to
<>Ka1bul. Ga1ndha1ri1 was the daughter of Subala. (Chap-
<>ter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Ga1ndha1ri1 became a devotee of S4iva even
<>from her childhood. S4iva became pleased with her and
<>blessed her saying that she would bear a hundred sons.
<>Bhi1s2ma came to know of this and he planned to get her
<>married to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. One day he sent a messenger
<>to Subala making a proposal. Subala knew that Dhr2-
<>tara1s2t2ra was born blind but considering his lineage and
<>the powerful alliance it would make, consented to the
<>proposal of Bhi1s2ma. S4akuni, brother of Ga1ndha1ri1, then
<>by the order of his father took Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1-
<>pura and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted her as his wife. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 obeying his father's instructions without a demur
<>accepted her blind husband with such devotion that
<>she made herself blind by tightly covering her eyes
<>with a silk shawl. (Chapter 110, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Birth of Sons.%} Once Vya1sa came to her exhausted
<>with hunger and thirst. Ga1ndha1ri1 appeased his hunger
<>and thirst with tasty things to eat and drink. Vya1sa
<>was immensely pleased and he also blessed her and
<>said she would get a hundred sons. Very soon she be-
<>came pregnant. But even after two years she did not
<>deliver, while Kunti1, wife of Pa1n2d2u, gave birth to a
<>son. Grief-stricken, she hit hardly on her womb secretly
<>and then a great mass of flesh came out. Then Vya1sa
<>appeared before her and advised her to cut the lump
<>of flesh into a hundred pieces and deposit one each in
<>a jar of ghee. Vya1sa himself cut it into pieces. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 expressed a desire to have a girl also. Vya1sa cut
<>it into hundred and one pieces and put them in hundred [Page275-a+ 65]
<>and one jars of ghee. In due time the jars broke and
<>a hundred sons and a daughter came out of the jars.
<>The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1. For their name see
<>‘Kauravas’. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra got another son named Yuyu-
<>tsu. (Chapters 115 and 116, A1di Parva).

<>death of Karn2a at the battle both Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 fainted. (S4loka 55, Chapter 96, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>5) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 starts to curse the Pa1n2d2avas.%} When the battle
<>was over the sons of Ga1ndha1ri1 and their followers were
<>killed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra suggested that the Pa1n2d2avas should
<>visit Ga1ndha1ri1 and pay homage to her. The Pa1n2d2avas,
<>therefore, went and stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 very res-
<>pectfully. Vengeance boiled in her heart and her body
<>shivered. Ga1ndha1ri1 was about to curse the Pa1n2d2avas
<>when Vya1sa, intervened saying “Ga1ndha1ri1! Don't you
<>remember you said that victory would lie on the side
<>of the righteous in this war? Your words are not wasted.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas won the battle because right was on
<>their side. So why should you get agitated?” Ga1ndha1ri1
<>became calm on hearing these words and she admitted
<>that the end of the Kuru dynasty came because of the
<>mistakes of Duryodhana, S4akuni, Karn2a and Dus4s4a1-
<>sana. She, thereafter, treated the Pa1n2d2avas as her own
<>sons. (Chapter 14, Stri1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's foot-nails become blue.%} Following the
<>instructions of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, the Pa1n2d2avas, approached
<>and bowed before Ga1ndha1ri1. She covered her face
<>with a cloth and wept, tears rolling down her cheeks.
<>When Dharmaputra bent to touch her feet the latter
<>saw through the veil on her face the foot-nails of
<>Dharmaputra. A few drops of the lachrymal water fell
<>on the foot-nails of Dharmaputra making them turn
<>blue instantly. (Chapter 15, Stri1 Parva).
<NI>7) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 curses Kr2s2n2a.%} At the end of the battle the
<>aggrieved Ga1ndha1ri1 went to Kuruks2etra together with
<>Kr2s2n2a and other relatives. Seeing mighty Kings on the
<>Kaurava side lying dead like huge trees lying truncated
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 burst into tears. She knew that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was at the root of all this. Embittered she looked at
<>Kr2s2n2a and cursed him. “Ho, Kr2s2n2a, thirtysix years
<>from this day you will lose your sons, ministers, friends
<>and relatives. You will become a lone walker in the
<>forests and be killed by trickery.”
<NI>It was because of this curse that the Ya1dava tribe perish-
<>ed and Kr2s2n2a was struck by the arrow of a hunter
<>which made him end his life on earth.
<NI>8) {%The end of Ga1ndha1ri1.%} After the great Kuruks2etra battle
<>heart-broken Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied
<>by Kunti1, Vidura and San5jaya went to the forests to
<>spend the rest of their life there. Many people and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas accompanied them up to the river Gan3ga1 and
<>there near the a1s4rama of S4atayu1pa Dhr2tara1s2t2ra made
<>a hut and lived with Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas felt the separation of their relatives
<>unbearable and lived in grief. After six years one day
<>Dharmaputra saw his mother, Kunti1, in a dream. He
<>told his brothers about this and they all felt a desire
<>to go to the forest and see their mother. The next day they
<>reached the shores of Gan3ga1. Vya1sa also joined them.
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 expressed a desire to Vya1sa that
<>they would like to see the dead sons and relatives once
<>again. Vya1sa then asked them to go and take a dip
<>in the river. When they rose up after a dip they saw [Page275-b+ 65]
<>standing on the shores of the river the great warriors
<>Karn2a and Duryodhana and others. By the yogic power
<>of Vya1sa even the blind Dhr2tara1s2t2ra could get the vision.
<>Very soon the vision faded and the Pa1n2d2avas returned
<>to Hastina1pura.
<NI>Two days after, fire broke out in the forest where
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was staying. Dhr2tara1s2tra, Kunti1 and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 were burnt to death in that fire. (Chapter 32,
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>9) {%After the death.%} Dharmaputra performed the obsequi-
<>es of those who died in the wild fire (A1s4ramava1sika

<HI>GANDHARVANAGARA. Vya1sa has compared munis
<>disappearing from sight to the fading out of Gandharva

<NI>“After having thus spoken to the Kurus, and while
<>they were looking on, the band of sages disappeared
<>in a trice like the fading out of Gandharvanagara.”
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 126, Verses 35 and 36).
<NI>What is this Gandharvanagara? The following descrip-
<>tion occurs in Hindi S4abdasa1gara. “Owing to different
<>optical illusions (sight) of man, villages and cities may
<>appear to exist in the sky and also on seas, rivers, etc.
<>When during summer the air on the upper strata of
<>deserts, seas etc. gets heated, expanded, and rises up,
<>the light passing through it becomes multi-coloured and
<>gives reflections in the sky in the form of village parts or
<>cities. Also can be seen therein reflections of trees,
<>boats etc. One such reflection may be cast on earth
<>also. This is a mere optical illusion. This reflection
<>immediately fades out also. This unreal city which is
<>an optical illusion is Gandharvanagara.
<HI>GANDHARVASENA1. Daughter of Dhanava1hana (a
<>gandharva) who lived in Svayamprabha1nagara on
<>Mount Kaila1sa. She was cured of leprosy by observing
<>somava1ravrata. (Skandha Pura1n2a).
<HI>GANDHARVATI1RTHA. An ancient place of pilgri-

<>visited this holy place. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 37,
<>Verse 9).
<HI>GANDHARVI1. The first mother of horses. Kas4yapapraja1-
<>pati had by his wife Krodhavas4a1 ten daughters: Mr2gi1,
<>Mr2gamanda1, Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, [Page276-a+ 64]

<>ka married Ga1ndini1. (Das4ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>GA1N2D2I1VA. The famous bow of Arjuna.
<NI>1) {%Make.%} It was Brahma1 who made the bow. ‘This
<>terrible bow which can punish the unjust and the
<>wicked has been made by Brahma1’. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 98, Verse 21).
<NI>2) {%Specialities of Ga1n2d2i1va.%} This bow is enough to fight
<>one lakh of people at one and the same time. Both
<>Devas and men could be defeated with it. Chiselled
<>very smooth and shining with many colours it was a
<>very long bow. It was worshipped by Devas, Da1navas
<>and Gandharvas. (Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 43). It
<>gained and also decreased in power as the situation
<>called for. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 98, Verse 20).
<NI>3) {%History of Ga1n2d2i1va.%} Brahma1, who made this bow
<>kept it with him during the first 1000 years. For the
<>next 1000 years Praja1pati kept it with him. Next, Indra
<>got it from Praja1pati and he used it for 3585 years.
<>After that Candra kept it for 500 years with him, and
<>then Varun2a came in possession of it. After using it for
<>100 years Varun2a gave it to Arjuna, who used it for 65
<>years.
<NI>4) {%Ga1n2d2i1va and Arjuna.%} Arjuna agreed to protect the
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest from rain, if Indra sent rain when
<>Agni began eating the forest. But, realising that Arjuna
<>possessed no weapons to effectively oppose Indra, Agni
<>requested Varun2a to give the following to Arjuna, viz.,
<>the Ga1n2d2i1va bow and a quiver wherein the arrows
<>will never be exhausted, and the chariot marked with
<>the symbol of monkey and drawn by four white horses
<>-all kept by Candra. Varun2a at once made a present
<>of the above to Arjuna. And, it was with the aid of this
<>Ga1n2d2i1va, that Arjuna defeated Indra at the time of
<>Kha1n2d2avada1ha. (See Kha1n2d2avada1ha). Arjuna had
<>taken a secret vow to cut off the head of anyone who
<>asked him to give the bow to some one else. (Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 69).
<NI>In after years Arjuna won many wars with the help of
<>this bow. (See Arjuna).
<NI>5) {%Arjuna gives up Ga1n2d2i1va.%} The great Kuruks2etra war,
<>which shook Bha1rata, to its very foundation came to an
<>end. Dharmaputra was crowned a King. It was at this
<>juncture that the Ya1dava dynasty got itself anni- [Page276-b+ 65]
<>hilated and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a entered maha1sama1dhi. Now the
<>Pa1n2d2avas lost all interest in mundane life, and they
<>set out for the forest on their great journey after crown-
<>ing Pari1ks2it, the grandson of Arjuna as King. Their
<>great travel took them to the shores of the Red Sea.
<>The Ga1n2d2i1va was still in Arjuna's hands. On the shores
<>of the Red Sea Agni Deva appeared before the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas and spoke to them “Well, Pa1n2d2avas, I am Agni
<>Deva. Arjuna requires the Ga1n2d2i1va no more. I got it
<>from Varun2a for Arjuna. Return it, therefore, to
<>Varun2a.”
<NI>No sooner did he hear Agni Deva speak thus than did
<>Arjuna throw it into the depths of the sea and also the
<>quiver which never got exhausted of arrows with it.
<>Agni Deva disappeared, and the Pa1n2d2avas continued
<>their journey. (Maha1prastha1nika Parva, Chapter 1).
<HI>GAN3GA1. The famous and holy river of India.
<NI>1) {%Origin and general information.%} Gan3ga1 had its origin
<>during the incarnation of Vis2n2u as Va1mana. When
<>Va1mana measured the three worlds in three steps the
<>nails on his left feet were raised high. They caused a
<>pore on the upper side of the universe. Gan3ga1, starting
<>from the finger of Vis2n2u's feet fell in heaven (Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>The famous Vis2n2upadi1, the flowing water (ti1rtha) of
<>which washes away the sins of the people in the universe
<>is the very same Gan3ga1 under discussion. For many
<>yugas (eras) this river confined itself to the heights of
<>the sky, otherwise called Vis2n2upada. This particular
<>spot is known as Dhruvaman2d2ala as it is here that
<>Dhruva, son of King Utta1napa1da, does, his penance.
<>The seven sages who constantly go round and round
<>the Dhruvaman2d2ala take their bath in this holy river.
<>The course of the river is thus: starting from Vis2n2upada
<>it falls on devaya1na glittering with crores of vima1nas
<>and therefrom it descends on Candraman2d2ala which it
<>submerges. It follows its course again from there divid-
<>ing itself into four tributaries called Si1ta1, Caks2us,
<>Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and then falls in Brahmaloka
<>wherefrom it flows in all directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries Si1ta1 falls on the head of Mount Meru, flows down
<>to Gandhama1dana, then circling through Bhadra1s4va
<>vars2a falls into the eastern sea. Caks2us falls on the
<>peaks of mount Ma1lyava1n, flows through Ketuma1la
<>and falls into the western sea. Alakananda1 falls on
<>mount Hemaku1t2a, flows through Bha1rata Vars2a and falls
<>into the southern sea. And Bhadra1 falls on the head
<>of mount S4r2n3gava1n flows through Uttarakuru and falls
<>into the northern sea. Alakananda1 flows through
<>Bha1rata Vars2a and is regarded as the most sacred of the
<>four tributaries.
<NI>Gan3ga1 which flowed through heaven fell on the earth
<>after thousands of years of its origin. (Bha1gavata,
<>Pan5cama, Skandha, Chapter 17).
<NI>2) {%Why Gan3ga1 became S4iva's consort.%} Maha1vis2n2u was
<>once engaged at Vaikun2t2ha in a pleasant talk with his
<>wives, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1 and Gan3ga1 when Gan3ga1 cast
<>lustful eyes on Vis2n2u, who, behind the backs of the
<>other two wives returned the lustful glances. Sarasvati1
<>could not put up with that situation for a long time.
<>Therefore, she got up from her seat and beat Gan3ga1.
<>Laks2mi1 tried to restrain Sarasvati1 lest the quarrel should
<>become fiercer. Angered at this intervention Sarasvati1
<>cursed that Laks2mi1 be born on earth. Gan3ga1 got angry
<>that innocent Laks2mi1 was thus cursed, and she in her [Page277-a+ 65]
<>turn cursed that Sarasvati1 be born as a river on earth.
<>Sarasvati1 did not take the curse lying down, but cursed
<>that Gan3ga1 also be born as a river on earth and take
<>upon herself the sins of the whole world. When all the
<>three wives of Vis2n2u got themselves thus into trouble
<>he told them as follows: “Everything has happened as
<>it should have happened. Laks2mi1 may go to the earth
<>and be born in the home of Dharmadhvaja and grow
<>up as his daughter, but not from the womb of his
<>women. There you will purify the three worlds after
<>which you will be born as the plant called tulasi1, and
<>be married by an asura called S4an3khacu1d2a, who will be
<>born as a part of me. And, after that you will be turned
<>into a sacred river called Padma1vati1, and leaving the
<>river on earth your divine form will return to Vaikun2-
<>t2ha.” And, to Gan3ga1 Vis2n2u said as follows: “You will
<>go to earth as a holy river to wash off the sins of people
<>there. A king called Bhagi1ratha will be leading you to
<>earth, and you will, therefore, be known as Bha1gi1rathi1
<>also. And, you remain there on earth as the wife of the
<>ocean of King S4antanu. Your divine form will return
<>to mount Kaila1sa as the consort of S4iva.” As for Sara-
<>svati1, Vis2n2u asked her to be born as a river on earth,
<>her divine form ultimately returning to Satyaloka and
<>then becoming the consort of Brahma1.
<NI>And, thus it was that Laks2mi1 became the consort of
<>Maha1vi1s2n2u, Gan3ga1 of S4iva and Sarasvati1 of Brahma1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Gan3ga1 born on earth due to the curse of Brahma1.%} Maha1-
<>bhis2ak, an emperor of the Iks2va1ku dynasty, went
<>to Satyaloka after he had attained heaven, to worship
<>Brahma1. Gan3ga1 too happened to be there. In the
<>devotional atmosphere at Satyaloka a casual breeze
<>removed Gan3ga1's clothes slightly from position, and
<>Maha1bhis2ak then cast a lustful glance at her which she
<>also returned. Brahma1, who was observing this exchange
<>of love got angry and cursed that Maha1bhi1s2ak be born
<>as a King on earth and Gan3ga1 as his wife. Gan3ga1
<>prayed for redemption from the curse, and Brahma1
<>told her that she would regain her old status after she
<>had delivered the As2t2avasus. As the consequence of
<>Brahma1's cure Maha1bhis2ak was born as King S4antanu
<>in the solar dynasty on earth and he married Gan3ga1.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapters 96 and 97).
<NI>4) {%Bhagi1ratha brought down Gan3ga1 on earth.%} King Sagara
<>of the solar dynasty had two wives called Sumati (Vai-
<>darbhi1) and Kes4ini1 (S4aibya1). A son called Asaman5jasa
<>was born to Kes4ini1, and 60,000 princes were born to
<>Sumati. Sagara drove out of the country Asamajn5asaa,
<>who turned out to be an enemy of the people. The
<>60,000 sons of Sagara also proved to be a menace to the
<>world, and the Devas approached Brahma1 for protection
<>from the menace. He assured the Devas that a sage
<>called Kapila will destroy the 60,000 evil fellows.
<NI>During the above period of time Sagara performed an
<>As4vamedha Yajn5a, and his sons went round the earth
<>with the sacrificial horse. But, when they reached the
<>sea-shore the horse disappeared. When the sons comp-
<>lained about it to their father, Sagara, he asked them
<>to look out for the horse in every part of the world and
<>bring it back. Not finding it anywhere on earth they
<>dug a hole and entered Pa1ta1la, where they saw Sage
<>Kapila absorbed in meditation and the missing horse
<>tied to a pole near the sage. (It was Indra who had
<>carried away the horse and tied it there). The sons of [Page277-b+ 64]
<>Sagara, believing that it was Kapila who had stolen
<>the horse were about to attack the sage when he opened
<>his eyes, and they were reduced to ashes in the fire of
<>Kapila's eyes.
<NI>His sons having not returned even after a long time
<>Sagara asked his grandson Am3s4uma1n to seek them out,
<>and after an extensive search he saw Kapila at Pa1ta1la.
<>Am3s4uma1n pleased Kapila with laudatory phrases and
<>the latter returned to him the sacrificial horse. Kapila
<>also pronounced the blessing that the grandson of Am3-
<>s4uma1n would perform the purificatory rites of Sagara's
<>sons by bringing down Gan3ga1 to earth from heaven.
<>Am3s4uma1n returned to the palace with the horse and
<>the as4vamedha was duly concluded.
<NI>From Am3s4uma1n was born Dili1pa and from him Bhagi1-
<>ratha. On becoming King, Bhagi1ratha handed over the
<>reins of government to his ministers and began efforts
<>to bring down Gan3ga1 to earth. He did tapas for thou-
<>sand years on the slopes of the Hima1layas when Gan3ga1
<>asked him to please S4iva first as he alone could face her
<>(Gan3ga1) fall on the earth. Accordingly he pleased S4iva
<>by his penance and S4iva agreed to receive Gan3ga1 on
<>his head. With a terrific noise Gan3ga1 came down on
<>S4iva's head. The haughty Gan3ga1 wanted to carry down
<>S4iva also to Pa1ta1la. Realising this ambition of her
<>S4iva blocked her passage with the result that she wan-
<>dered about in S4iva's matted hair for many years
<>without finding an outlet. Bhagi1ratha again did tapas
<>and pleased S4iva who shook his matted head and made
<>fall some water therefrom on earth. The water fell into
<>Bindusaras, and flowed in seven tributaries, the first
<>three, Hla1dini1, Pa1vani1 and Nalini1 towards the east, the
<>next three, Sucaks2us, Si1ta1 and Sindhu towards the west
<>and the seventh tributary followed Bhagi1ratha. In this
<>manner they progressed a great distance till they reach-
<>ed the a1s4rama of the sage Jahnu, and the haughty
<>Gan3ga1 flooded the a1s4rama. The sage got enraged at
<>this and drank up Gan3ga1. But Bhagi1ratha pleased the
<>sage who then let out Gan3ga1 through his ears. Thence-
<>forth Gan3ga1 came to be called Ja1hnavi1 also. Gan3ga1
<>again followed Bhagi1ratha to Pa1ta1la and made the sons
<>of Sagara attain salvation by purifying them with her
<>waters. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 43
<>and 44; Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 97; Devi1 Pura1n2a,
<>Dviti1ya Skandha; Dron2a Parva, Chapter 60; Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 4 and Vana Parva, Chapter 109).
<NI>5) {%Gan3ga1 flowed into the sea.%} After the purificatory rites
<>of the sons of Sagara were over, Bhagi1ratha conducted
<>Gan3ga1 to the sea and with its waters the sea became
<>full. (Vana Parva, Chapter 109, Verses 18-21).
<NI>6) {%Gan3ga1 set on the thighs of Prati1pa.%} Gan3ga1 once fell
<>in love with Prati1pa, father of S4antanu, and set on his
<>right thigh when he (Prati1pa) was doing penance on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for a son. Prati1pa did not agree
<>to Gan3ga1's proposal that he should marry her and told
<>her thus: “the right thigh is for the children and
<>daughters-in-law to sit on and the left thigh for the
<>wife; therefore, you be my son's wife.”
<NI>Then Prati1pa called his son S4antanu and told him:
<>“Sometime back a divine woman came to me and I
<>promised to wed her to you. Therefore, if any divine
<>woman approaches you for a son you must accept her,
<>and whatever she may do you must not object to
<>that...”. Not long after this Prati1pa crowned S4antanu [Page278-a+ 65]
<>King and left for the forest, (A1di Parva, Chapter 97).
<NI>7) {%As2t2avasus and Gan3ga1.%} While the wife of Dyau, one
<>of the As2t2avasus (eight Vasus) was roaming about in
<>the forest she saw Nandini1 (the divine cow) grazing
<>with her calf near the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha, and she
<>desired to have the cow to be presented to her intimate
<>friend Jitavati1, the daughter of King Us4i1nara. She
<>informed her husband, Dyau about this desire of hers,
<>and Dyau told his relations about it. Next day the
<>As2t2avasus, in the absence of Vasis2t2ha at the a1s4rama,
<>stole off Nandini1 and her calf. When Vasis2t2ha returned
<>to the a1s4rama the cow and calf were missing, and he
<>divined the reason for it with his divine eyes. He cursed
<>that the As2t2avasus be born as men on earth, and when
<>they prayed for redemption from the curse Vasis2t2ha
<>told them that they would be born as men within one
<>year from that day, die at once and return to heaven
<>At the same time the sage said that Dyau alone, who
<>took the leading part in stealing the cow, would live on
<>earth for a longer period before he returned to heaven.
<>(The reputed Bhi1s2ma was this Dyau). The As2t2avasus
<>set out for the earth to be born as men and on their
<>way they met Gan3ga1 and told her about their curse
<>etc. Gan3ga1 also told them about her curse, and permitt-
<>ed them to be born in her womb. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>99).
<NI>8) {%Gan3ga1 became the wife of S4antanu and the As2t2avasus were
<>born.%} Once while hunting on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>S4antanu saw a beautiful maiden and they fell in love
<>with each other. She agreed to become his wife on the
<>condition that he would not oppose whatever she said.
<>S4antanu agreed to it and married her. Soon after a
<>child was born to them and in the very presence of
<>S4antanu, she threw the child into the Gan3ga1. As per
<>previous condition S4antanu kept mum at this. She
<>threw into the river the seven As2t2avasus, who were
<>born to her in succession. When she was about to
<>throw the last eighth of the As2t2avasus (Dyau) into
<>the river S4antanu prevented her. She got angry at
<>this and disappeared with the child. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 98).
<NI>9) {%S4antanu got back the son.%} Thirtytwo years after,
<>S4antanu went hunting again on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>where he saw the river obstructed in its course with
<>arrows by a handsome boy. S4antanu did not recognise
<>that the boy was his son, who had been named Deva-
<>vrata by Gan3ga1. Devavrata disappeared after throwing
<>S4antanu into an illusion by his magic power. All of a
<>sudden a doubt dawned in his mind whether the boy
<>was his own son, and he called out to Gan3ga1 to show
<>him the boy. Gan3ga1 appeared with her son with beau-
<>tiful ornaments on him and spoke to S4antanu thus:
<>“This is Devavrata, the eighth son whom you entrusted
<>to me. He has mastered everything in archery from
<>Vasis2t2ha, and he is Dyau (the vasu) son of An3gi-
<>ras reborn. You may please take charge of him.” After

<NI>12) {%Greatness (divine nature) of Gan3ga1.%} Maha1bha1rata has
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 26), the following on the
<>greatness of Gan2ga1.--
<NI>If, after death, the bones of the dead are deposited [Page278-b+ 64]
<>in Gan3ga1 the departed will attain heaven. Even if one
<>had sinned throughout his life he would attain Vis2n2u-
<>pa1da (heaven) if he worshipped Gan3ga1. Bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1 is as beneficial as performing hundred yajn5as.
<>As long as the bones of one remain in the waters of the
<>Gan3ga1 so long will he occupy an honourable seat in
<>heaven. He who has come in contact with its water will
<>shine forth as the sun devoid of all darkness. Places
<>which are not favoured by its waters will become barren
<>like night without the moon and trees without flowers.
<>Gan3ga1 water is more than enough to satisfy living
<>things in all the three worlds. He who does penance
<>standing on one leg for thousand years, and he who
<>gives up his body in the waters of the Gan3ga1 are on
<>a par with each other. God attaches more importance
<>to him who has fallen into the Gan3ga1 than to him, who
<>has performed tapas hanging by his head for a thousand
<>years. He who smears the sand on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>on his body will get the lustre and glow of the devas,
<>and he, who smears the sand on his head will shine
<>forth like the Sun. All the sins of those on whom has
<>blown the air which had come in contact with Gan3ga1
<>water will be swept away. It should be known that
<>Gan3ga1 water can wash off all sins and purify mortals.
<>The Agni Pura1n2a (Chapter 110) has the following on
<>this subject.
<NI>Through whatever places the Gan3ga1 flows those places
<>become sublime and sacred. Gan3ga1 is the refuge of all
<>created beings who aspire for the final good. If Gan3ga1
<>is worshipped daily it will save families both on the
<>mother's and the father's side from evil fate. To drink
<>Gan3ga1 water is better than the observance of a thou-
<>sand lunar months. If one worships Gan3ga1 for a month
<>one will derive all the benefits of having performed all
<>the yajn5as. Even the blind (the ignorant) who worship
<>Gan3ga1, will attain equal status with the devas. The
<>sight of Gan3ga1, contact with its waters and drinking
<>Gan3ga1 water will purify people in thousands and lakhs.

<HI>GARBHA(M). The Pura1n2as have described the views
<>of sages about the origin of a1tman in woman's womb.
<>Asitamaha1muni stated the following about the birth of [Page279-b+ 63]
<>a child to King Janaka. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Chapter
<NI>48). Of the seven elements in the human body, viz.,
<>Rasa, Rakta (blood), Ma1m3sa (flesh), Medas (fost),
<>Asthi (bone), Majja1 (marrow) and S4ukla (seminal
<>fluid) the last one, S4ukla, is the most valuable. Brahma-
<>bi1ja (the seed for production) is contained in S4ukla.
<>From the food we consume, blood and the seminal fluid
<>take their nutrition. The S4ukla emitted during coitus
<>enters the womb of the woman propelled as it were by
<>Kros2t2ava1yu. It takes only one night for the S4ukla to
<>get inextricably mixed with blood in the womb. In that
<>mixing if the proportion of blood is higher, the child
<>born will be girl, and if the proportion of S4ukla is high-
<>er, the offspring will be boy. If blood and S4ukla are
<>mixed exactly in equal proportions the child will be
<>‘neutral’, neither girl nor boy. During the first month
<>of pregnancy the child will be in liquid form. In the
<>second, it solidifies due to the mixing and interplay of
<>heat, cold, air, etc. During the third, holes for
<>eye, ear, etc. become ready and the vein system is
<>formed. In the fourth, head, hands and legs of the
<>child are formed, and it is during this period that the
<>prospective mother develops certain desires. If those
<>desires are not satisfied the child may be born with
<>physical deformities. During the fifth month the hips
<>and bones develop. The various organs get firmer and
<>stronger gradually and fingers appear during the sixth
<>month. It is during the sixth month that hairs on the
<>head and body appear and feelings and emotions ori-
<>ginate in the mind. During the seventh month the ten
<>va1yus (winds) on the basis of the nervous system are
<>released, and the child experiences glimpses of its pre-
<>vious existence, and ability to feel pain also is there.
<>During the ninth month due to the force of the wind
<>which effects actual delivery the child gets head down
<>in the womb, and during the tenth month it emerges
<>out of the womb. The child loses its memory about the
<>past because of its contact with the female organ
<>and external wind.
<NI>According to the Agni Pura1n2a the process is a little
<>different:
<NI>When Ji1va (the soul) has entered the womb for rebirth
<>it remains in fluid form during the first month. During
<>the second month it solidifies; in the third month the
<>organs begin to develop, in the fourth month skin,
<>flesh and bones appear, in the fifth month hairs appear,
<>in the sixth month mind is produced, in the seventh
<>month the child will begin to feel pain. The body is
<>covered by a skin (Garbhacarma) and both hands are
<>held above the head in saluting position. If the child
<>is a female it lies in the left side of the mother's womb,
<>if a male on the right and if ‘neutral’ in the middle of
<>it. From the seventh month the child begins to experi-
<>ence the taste of foods consumed by the mother. During
<>the eighth and ninth month there would be great
<>emotional excitements and upsurges. If the mother
<>suffered from chronic diseases the child also would in-
<>herit it. When pregnancy is matured thus, certain
<>winds lead the child down the womb and it gets out
<>through the female organ.
<NI>The child inherits its skin, flesh and heart from the
<>mother. The sex organ, marrow, excretion, sweet and
<>belly are inherited from the father. Head, the nervous [Page280-a+ 64]
<>system and s4ukla are the contributions of the a1tman.

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Br2haspati once approached, on the crest of
<>a wave of lust, Mamata1, his brother's wife who was
<>pregnant then. The child from the mother's womb said
<>‘no’ to the move. But, Br2haspati cursed the child and
<>had his own way with Mamata1. Thus two children
<>developed in her womb. Just after delivering the child-

<>pati behind. The Devas took charge of the forsaken
<>child and named him Bharadva1ja. Ultimately they
<>handed over the child (Bharadva1ja) to king Bharata,
<>the famous son of Dus2yanta. Children had already been
<>born to Bharata by his three wives, but as all of them
<>were found to be immoral the mothers themselves killed
<>them. It was at such a juncture that Bharata got Bha-
<>radva1ja as adopted son. (Bharadva1ja is known by
<>another name also, Vitatha). From Vitatha was born
<>Manyu, from Manyu Br2hatks2etra from Br2hatks2etra
<>Jaya and from Jaya Garga. The famous Rantideva
<>was the grandson of Nara. (the brother of Garga) and
<>son of Sam3kr2ti. A son called S4ani was born to Garga
<>after which he took to Sannya1sa. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama

<NI>2) {%How he became prosperous.%} Sage Ga1rgya had many
<>children. It was while he was staying in the forest with
<>his wife and children that S4ri1 Ra1ma came to that forest
<>for Vanava1sa. The news of the exile of S4ri1 Ra1ma spread
<>like wild-fire and many brahmins flocked to the place
<>and S4ri1 Ra1ma gave them immense riches. Wife of Ga1r-
<>gya heard the news only late and as soon as she heard
<>the same she called her husband from the fields where
<>he was working and taking away from him the imple-
<>ments sent him post-haste to the place of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Trijat2a as soon as he came to the presence of Ra1ma told
<>him the purpose of his visit. Huge herds of cows were
<>then grazing on the banks of the Yamuna1 river. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma told Ga1rgya to take a stump and throw it with
<>all his strength. He did so and S4ri1 Ra1ma gave him all
<>the cows grazing up to the place where the stump fell.
<>It was a big lot and Ga1rgya became prosperous from
<>that day onwards. (Sarga 32, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1m3a1yan2a).

<HI>GARUD2A. King of birds.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Brahma1
<>-Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Garud2a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci married the eight daughters of Daks2a called
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1. And to Ta1mra1 five daughters were born,
<>viz. Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. Out
<>of the five women Kraun5ci1 became mother of the owls,
<>Bha1si1 delivered the bha1sas (types of birds) and from
<>S4yeni1 were born vultures and kites. Ham3sa, Kalaham3sa,
<>Koka etc. are children of Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1. From S4uki1 was
<>born Nala1 and from Nala1, Vinata1; Arun2a and Garud2a
<>were the two sons born to Vinata1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 15).
<NI>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata about the birth of
<>Arun2a and Garud2a. Kas4yapa who was much pleased
<>with the service of Vinata1 and Kadru1 asked them to
<>select any boon they desired. Kadru1 chose to have a
<>thousand na1gas as her children while Vinata1 chose to
<>have two sons more powerful and heroic than the thou-
<>sand sons of Kadru1. After granting them the boon
<>Kas4yapa retreated into the forest.
<NI>After some time Kadru1 laid thousand eggs and Vinata1
<>two eggs. Both of them kept their eggs in hot pots. In
<>the 500th year the eggs of Kadru1 hatched and thousand
<>serpents of various kinds emerged out of them. But
<>Vinata1's eggs did not hatch yet, and the sight of Kadru1
<>playing with her children pained Vinata1 much. She,
<>therefore, broke open one of her eggs in secret, and a
<>half-grown child stepped out of it. That child was
<>Arun2a. Arun2a got angry that Vinata1 forced open the
<>egg prematurely. He told her that as punishment there-
<>of she would become a slave of Kadru1. But, Arun2a
<>granted her redemption from the curse thus: After an-
<>other 500 years the remaining egg of yours will hatch
<>and a son endowed with exceptional power and pro-
<>wess will be born to you. He will liberate you from
<>slavery.” After telling his mother so much Arun2a rose
<>to the sky where he became the charioteer of the Sun.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 16. See also Para 6 infra).
<NI>After 500 years the egg broke itself open and out came
<>Garud2a with blazing effulgence, and he rose up in the
<>sky. His body glowed like the sun. The Devas who got
<>themselves dimmed by his effulgence asked Agnideva
<>the reason therefor. Agnideva told them about the
<>birth of Garud2a and also that he was equally effulgent
<>as himself (Agnideva). Then all of them went to
<>Garud2a and lavished on his head all possible blessings,
<>and Garud2a, as requested by them, controlled his efful-
<>gence and returned to his mother. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 23).
<NI>3) {%Slavery of Vinata1:%} The churning of the Milk-ocean
<>was done before Garud2a was born. Indra got a horse
<>named Uccaih2s4ravas from the Ocean of Milk. Between
<>Kadru1 and Vinata1 a dispute arose as regards the colour
<>of the horse's tail, Kadru1 saying that it was black while
<>Vinata1 asserted that it was white. They further agreed
<>to test the colour the next day, betting that she who
<>was proved to be wrong would become the slave of the
<>victor. As the na1ga sons of Kadru1 hung on to the tail [Page281-b+ 64]
<>of the horse the tail appeared to be black and Vinata1
<>lost the bet and became Kadru1's slave.
<NI>It was at this juncture that Garud2a was born, and he
<>felt highly mortified to find his mother working as a
<>slave of Kadru1.
<NI>Kadru1 and her na1ga sons once ordered Vinata1 to carry
<>them to the na1ga residence in the middle of the ocean,
<>called Ra1man2i1yaka (Raman2am). Accordingly Vinata1
<>carrying Kadru1 on her shoulders and Garud2a carrying
<>Kadru1's sons on his shoulders rose up in the sky. But,
<>Garud2a did not relish the slavish work, and he, carry-
<>ing with him the na1gas, flew up to the sun's orbit. The
<>na1ga children fainted due to the excessive heat. But, on
<>the request of Kadru1 Indra sent heavy rain and the
<>na1gas regained consciousness. By then they had reached
<>Ra1man2i1yaka island.
<NI>4) {%Attempt at freeing Vinata1 from thraldom.%} Garud2a, ex-
<>tremely pained at the pitiable plight of his mother, one
<>day asked Kadru1 what price she and her children
<>demanded for freeing Vinata1 from slavery, and Kadru1
<>demanded Amr2ta from Devaloka as the price.
<>Garud2a decided to get it and informed his mother
<>about his decision to fly to Devaloka. But, what about
<>food till he reached Devaloka? Vinata1 solved the pro-
<>blem by advising Garud2a to eat the nis2a1das he will
<>meet on his way to Devaloka at the island called
<>Nis2a1da1laya, at the same time specially forbidding him
<>from eating on any account, brahmins who might be
<>there, at Nis2a1da1laya. How to distinguish brahmins
<>from others, queried Garud2a, and his mother replied
<>by pointing out that the brahmin will burn the throat
<>of him who tries to eat him, like fire. Then Vinata1
<>blessed her son that his wings would be protected by
<>Va1yu, the lower half of his body by sun and moon, the
<>rest of the body by the Vasus and the head by Agni.
<>She also promised to wait there till her son returned.
<NI>5) {%Garud2a to Devaloka.%} After saluting his mother
<>Garud2a set out on his quest for Amr2ta. All the fourteen
<>worlds shook at the lashing of his wings. He reached
<>Nis2a1da1laya, where while consuming whole lots of Nis2a1-
<>das a brahmin and his wife also happened to get into
<>his throat. Garud2a felt their presence immediately in
<>his throat and requested them to get out of his mouth.
<>Accordingly they got out and also blessed Garud2a, who
<>continued on his journey.
<NI>Next Garud2a reached the forest where his father
<>Kas4yapa was engaged in tapas. He told him about his
<>mission and requested him for something to eat.
<>Kas4yapa replied thus:--“You see a pool wherein an
<>elephant and a tortoise are living for long as enemies.
<>Long ago two brothers Vibha1vasu and Suprati1ka quar-
<>relled over their paternal wealth and at the height of
<>it Vibha1vasu cursed Suprati1ka to become an elephant
<>when Suprati1ka pronounced the counter curse that
<>Vibha1vasu should turn out to be a tortoise. You, my
<>son Garud2a may eat that elephant and tortoise. May
<>your journey for Amr2ta be crowned with success.
<NI>Now, Garud2a after saluting his father, flew up in the
<>sky carrying in his beak the elephant and the tortoise
<>from the pool. As trees were falling uprooted due to
<>the terrific vibrations caused by the lashing of his wings
<>Garud2a did not find a convenient place to sit down to
<>eat his food. While continuing the journey Garud2a saw
<>a big tree, its branches spread out in a circumference [Page282-a+ 65]
<>of a hundred yojanas. But, as soon as Garud2a set foot on
<>a branch of the tree it (branch) crumbled down. On
<>that broken branch were the sages called Ba1lakhilyas
<>doing tapas hanging their heads down. Fearing that the
<>sages might fall down Garud2a continued his flight
<>holding in his beak the torn branch of the tree. But he
<>could not find a safe place to deposit the branch with
<>the sages. So he came again to Mount Gandhama1dana
<>and saw Kas4yapa, who apologised to the Ba1lakhilyas
<>on behalf of his son and also explained to them about
<>his mission. The Ba1lakhilyas were pleased and they left
<>the place for the Hima1layas. As advised by Kas4yapa
<>Garud2a deposited the branch of the tree on an unin-
<>habited mountain peak. Garud2a ate the elephant and
<>the tortoise there, and therefrom flew to Devaloka (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 29, 30).
<NI>6) {%Ba1lakhilyas cursed Indra.%} Even before the arrival of
<>Garud2a ill omens began appearing in Devaloka. Indra
<>asked Br2haspati for explanation about the ill omens.
<>Br2haspati with his divine eyes saw Garud2a approach-
<>ing Devaloka for Amr2ta, and he told Indra about
<>Garud2a born out of the powers of the tapas of Kas4yapa
<>and the Ba1lakhilyas. He also told that such a fate as
<>the present one befell Indra due to a curse of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas. Indra and the other Devas stood guard
<>over the pot of Amr2ta ready to repel all possible
<>attacks.
<NI>There was a reason for Garud2a's birth from the powers
<>of the tapas of the Ba1lakhilyas, and also for Indra to
<>be put into the present predicament due to the curse
<>of the Ba1lakhilyas. Kas4yapapraja1pati, a long time ago,
<>began a terrific yajn5a for a son, and Indra and the
<>Ba1lakhilyas who numbered more than 60,000 were
<>deputed by Kas4yapa to collect firewood for the yajn5a.
<>The Ba1lakhilyas were only of the size of a thumb, and
<>Indra who very easily collected all the firewood needed
<>for the yajn5a laughed at the tiny Ba1lakhilyas who were
<>carrying small twigs etc. for firewood. Angered at the
<>insult the Ba1lakhilyas removed themselves to another
<>place nearby and began a yajn5a directed against Indra
<>who alarmed at it sought the help of Kas4yapa who then
<>held peace talks with the Ba1lakhilyas. They transferred
<>their ya1gas4akti (ya1jn5ic powers) also to Kas4yapa and
<>agreed to be satisfied with the condition that as the
<>result of Kas4yapa's yajn5a a son should be born to him,
<>who (the son) would defeat Indra. Thus, for the time
<>being Indra escaped from the wrath of the Ba1lakhilyas.
<>After the yajn5a was over Vinata1 came to Kas4yapa and
<>he blessed her with a son wishing that he should be-
<>come exceptionally strong and powerful, and that was
<>Garud2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>7) {%Amr2takalas4a1paharan2am. (The pot of nectar carried
<>away).%} Garud2a approached the pot of nectar, and
<>Vis4vakarma1 who attacked him first was felled to the
<>ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of
<>Garud2a's wings blinded everybody. The Devas and
<>Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up
<>against Garud2a, but he defeated them all, and entered
<>the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept.
<>Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and
<>they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to
<>lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels.
<>Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with
<>glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of
<>fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very [Page282-b+ 65]
<>look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to
<>death. Garud2a blinded those eyes by raising a torrent
<>of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and
<>and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny
<>shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the
<>wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar
<>in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the
<>sun by his outspread wings. Maha1vis2n2u, who became so
<>much pleased with the tremendous achievements of
<>Garud2a asked him to choose any boon. Garud2a
<>requested Vis2n2u that he should be made his (Vis2n2u's)
<>vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting
<>amr2ta. Both the boons were granted.
<NI>8) {%Garud2a and Indra became friends.%} Indra hit with the
<>Vajra (his special weapon) the wings of Garud2a who
<>was returning from Vis2n2u. It did not wound his body,
<>but a feather of his fell in the atmosphere. Everybody
<>who saw the feather acclaimed Garud2a as Suparn2a (he
<>with the good wings). Indra was wonder-struck, and
<>he approached Garud2a and requested that they should
<>be friends in future and the pot of nectar be returned.
<>Garud2a replied that the nectar would be returned if
<>he was granted the power to make na1gas his food, and
<>Indra blessed him that he would live by consuming
<>na1gas. And then Garud2a told Indra thus: “I took this
<>pot of amr2ta not for my own use. The na1gas cheated
<>my mother and made her a slave, and she will be freed
<>if only this pot of nectar is given to them (na1gas). You
<>may snatch off the pot from the na1gas; I shall not
<>object to it.”
<NI>Indra and Garud2a thus became friends and the former
<>followed Garud2a on his way back home.
<NI>9) {%Garud2a handed over the pot of amr2ta to the na1gas and
<>Indra cheated them of it.%} Garud2a handed over the pot of
<>nectar to the na1gas, who on the suggestion of the
<>former placed the pot on darbha grass spread on the
<>ground. Also, in accordance with Garud2a's advice that
<>they should take a purificatory bath before tasting the
<>amr2ta the na1gas went out to have the bath, and in
<>their absence Indra carried off the pot of nectar back
<>to Devaloka. Failing to find the pot of nectar on their
<>return from bath the aggrieved na1gas licked the darbha
<>on which the pot was placed with the result that their
<>tongues were cloven into two. It was from that day
<>onwards that the na1gas became double-tongued
<>(dvijihvas). And, thus Garud2a redeemed his mother
<>from slavery. (A1di Parva, Chapter 34).
<NI>10) {%The fig tree which Garud2a broke with his beaks and
<>Lan3ka1.%} It has been noted above that Garud2a on his
<>way to Devaloka rested on a fig tree. That fig is
<>called Subhadra in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>Ra1van2a saw the fig tree around which sages were sitting
<>and which bore marks made by Garud2a sitting thereon.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 35, Verse
<>26).
<NI>There is some connection between this tree and Lan3ka1.
<>Garud2a had, as directed by Kas4yapa, deposited in the
<>sea the branch of the tree on which the Ba1lakhilyas
<>hung in tapas and with which Garud2a flew hither and
<>thither fearing about the safety of the Ba1lakhilyas. At
<>the spot in the sea where the branch was deposited
<>sprang up an island like the peak of a mountain. It
<>was this island which in after years became reputed as
<>Lan3ka1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 4). [Page283-a+ 65]
<NI>11) {%Garud2a, Saubhari and Ka1liya.%} Garud2a had always
<>entertained great hatred against the na1gas, and now
<>Indra's permission having been obtained by him to eat
<>the na1gas for food, Garud2a decided to launch a regular
<>na1ga-hunting expedition. He began eating the na1gas
<>one by one. Alarmed at this the na1gas planned for their
<>security in a conclave, and approached Garud2a with
<>the proposal that one na1ga would go to him daily
<>to serve as his food instead of his indiscriminate killing
<>of them. Garud2a accepted their proposal. After some
<>time the na1gas proposed to Garud2a that they would
<>conduct a sarpa-bali (sacrifice of serpents) and submit
<>the food got out of the bali to him so that his na1ga-
<>hunting might be stopped for ever. Garud2a agreed to
<>this also. According to the new agreement daily one
<>na1ga began going to Garud2a with the food got
<>out of the bali.
<NI>But Ka1liya alone did not agree to the programme as he
<>did not recognise Garud2a to be superior to him in
<>power. And, Garud2a, who wanted to teach the haughty
<>Ka1liya a lesson challenged him to fight, and the fight
<>took place in river Ka1lindi1, Ka1liya's abode. During
<>the fight the lashing of Garud2a's wings raised the
<>water in Ka1lindi1 up in the sky and it drenched the
<>sage Saubhari all over, who was performing tapas on
<>the banks of Ka1lindi1. Saubhari cursed that the body
<>of Garud2a be shattered into a thousand pieces if ever
<>he entered that area in future, and thenceforth the
<>place became a prohibited area for Garud2a. During
<>after years Ka1liya was put up at this place.
<NI>A kadamba tree alone outlived the eflect of the poison
<>of Ka1liya. The tree could outlive the deadly poison
<>because Garud2a had rested on it on his way back from
<>Devaloka with amr2ta. (Bha1gavata das4ama S4kandha).
<NI>12) {%Relationship of Garud2a with the kings of the solar
<>dynasty.%} King Sagara of the solar dynasty was married
<>to Sumati, the elder sister of Garud2a, and there is a
<>story behind the marriage.
<NI>There was once a king called Suba1hu in the solar
<>dynasty. He married one Ya1davi1, but for many years
<>they had no issues. Ya1davi1 had become old by the
<>time she conceived a child as the result of many
<>yajn5as etc. But, Suba1hu's other wives, viz. co-wives
<>of Ya1davi1, did not like the prospects of Ya1davi1
<>becoming a mother. They administered poison to her
<>with the result that Ya1davi1 did not deliver in time,
<>but continued as a pregnant woman for seven years.
<>The sad couple, for their mental relief went into the
<>forest and lived as disciples of a sage called Aurva. But
<>Suba1hu died rather soon and Ya1davi1 prepared
<>herself to follow him in the funeral pyre. But, the
<>sage Aurva prevented her from self immolation speak-
<>ing to her thus: “You shall not act rashly. The child
<>in your womb will become a famous emperor and rule
<>over the whole world.”
<NI>Ya1davi1 yielded to the sage's advice and did not court
<>death, and soon afterwards she delivered a son, and he
<>was named Sagara, which meant “he who was affected
<>by poison even while he was in the mother's womb. It
<>was this child who, in later years, became reputed as
<>emperor Sagara.
<NI>Sagara married the elder sister of Garud2a when he was
<>living as a boy in Aurva's a1s4rama, and there is a story
<>behind the marriage, a story which related to the time
<>when Garud2a was not born. [Page283-b+ 65]
<NI>Vinata1, mother of Garud2a, while she was working as the
<>slave of Kadru1, one day went into the woods to collect
<>firewood for her mistress. In the terrible rain and
<>storm that ensued, Vinata1 lost her track and wandered
<>in the forest for many days before she could take shelter
<>in the a1s4rama of a Sannya1sin. The pious man felt sorry
<>for poor Vinata1 and blessed her that a son, who would
<>be able to win freedom for her would be born to her.
<>Garud2a was the son thus born to her.
<NI>Before the birth of Garud2a when Kas4yapa and Vinata1
<>were living together with their daughter Sumati the boy
<>sage Upamanyu, son of Sutapas, went to them and told
<>Kas4yapa thus: “While touring round the earth I wor-
<>shipped the pitr2s at Gaya1 and I have been told that they
<>(Pitr2s) would get redemption only in case I married and
<>became a father. I, therefore, request you to please give
<>your daughter Sumati to me as wife. Vinata1 did not
<>relish this proposal. Upamanyu got angry at the re-
<>jection of his offer and cursed Vinata1 saying that if
<>Sumati was given in marriage to any other brahmin boy
<>she (Vinata1) would die with her head broken into
<>pieces.
<NI>It was during this period when Vinata1 was in a fix
<>about the marriage of Sumati that Garud2a was born to
<>her. He also thought over the problem and argued like
<>this: the curse is only against a brahmin boy marrying
<>my sister Sumati; why not Sumati be given in marriage
<>to a Ks2atriya; but where to find an eligible Ks2atriya
<>boy? At this stage Vinata1 asked him to go and meet the
<>Sannya1sin, who had promised her an illustrious son, in
<>the forest and this Sannya1sin directed Garud2a to Aurva,
<>for advice and guidance. When Garud2a met Aurva and
<>sought his advice about the marriage of his sister, the
<>sage thought that the context offered a very good bride
<>to Sagara. And, according to Aurva's advice Sumati
<>was married to Sagara, and thus Garud2a became re-
<>lated to the Kings of the Solar dynasty. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The Sixty thousand
<>sons born to Sagara by Sumati were reduced to ashes in
<>the fire which emanated from the eyes of Kapila. (See
<>Kapila). When Am3s4uma1n, the grandson of Sagara was
<>going around the world to find out these 60,000 sons he
<>met Garud2a on the way, and it was he who advised that
<>the waters of Gan3ga1 should be brought down on earth
<>so that the dead sons of Sagara might get spiritual
<>redemption. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 41).
<NI>13) {%Garud2a's conceit laid low.%} A very beautiful daughter,
<>Gun2akes4i1, was born to Ma1tali, the charioteer of Indra.
<>In the course of his search for a suitable husband for
<>Gun2akes4i1 he came to Pa1ta1laloka in the company of
<>Na1rada, and there Ma1tali selected a noble na1ga called
<>Sumukha as his prospective son-in-law. But a month
<>before Garud2a had eaten Sumukha's father Cikara, and
<>he had also given notice to Sumukha that within a
<>month's time he too would be eaten.
<NI>Na1rada and Ma1tali met Sumukha at the abode of his
<>grandfather A1ryaka, who was very glad to marry his
<>grandson to Ma1tali's daughter. But, the threat of
<>Garud2a that he would eat Sumukha before the month
<>was over stared them all cruelly in their face. So, they
<>appealed to Indra for a solution to the problem, in the
<>presence of Maha1vis2n2u. Indra gave an extension of life
<>to Sumukha and he wedded Gun2akes4i1. The marriage
<>enraged Garud2a so much that he went to Indra's [Page284-a+ 64]
<>assembly and insulted both Indra and Vis2n2u at which
<>Vis2n2u extended his right hand to Garud2a asking him
<>whether he could hold the hand. And, when Garud2a
<>placed Vis2n2u's hand on his head he felt as if the whole
<>weight of the three worlds was put on the head. Garud2a
<>admitted his defeat. Maha1vis2n2u thus laid low the
<>conceit of Garud2a. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<NI>14) {%Garud2a helped Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava was a disciple of
<>Vis4va1mitra. Once Dharmadeva, to test Vis4va1mitra, went
<>to his a1s4rama disguised as Vasis2t2ha and asked for food.
<>As there was no ready-made food at the a1s4rama just
<>then, Vis4va1mitra naturally took some time to cook new
<>food, and he went with it, steaming hot, in a plate to
<>the guest. Saying that he would return within minutes
<>and receive the food, the guest (Dharmadeva) left the
<>place, and Vis4va1mitra stood there with the plate in
<>hand awaiting the return of the guest. He had to
<>remain standing thus for one hundred years, and during
<>this whole period it was Ga1lava who stood there looking
<>after his guru. When hundred years were completed
<>Dharmadeva returned to Vis4va1mitra and accepted his
<>hospitality, and then only could the latter take some
<>rest.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra blessed Ga1lava, and now it was time for him
<>to leave the a1s4rama. Though Vis4va1mitra told that no
<>gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee) was required Ga1lava persist-
<>ed in asking him what fee or present he wanted.
<>Vis4va1mitra lost his temper and told Ga1lava that if he
<>was so very particular about gurudaks2in2a1, eight hun-
<>dred horses all having the colour of moon, and one ear
<>black in colour might be given as daks2in2a1. Ga1lava
<>stood there aghast at the above pronouncement of his
<>preceptor, when Garud2a happened to go over there and
<>hear from Ga1lava about his sad plight. Money was re-
<>quired to purchase horses, but Ga1lava was penniless.
<>At any rate Garud2a with Ga1lava on his back flew east-
<>wards and reached R2s2abhaparvata and they rested on
<>a peak of it. There the Brahma1 woman, S4a1n2d2ili1 was
<>engaged in tapas and she served them with food. After
<>food Garud2a spoke disparagingly about S4a1n2d2ili1. Garud2a
<>and Ga1lava slept that night on the floor, but when they
<>woke up in the morning lo! Garud2a was completely
<>shed of his feathers. Garud2a stood before S4a1n2d2ili1, his
<>head bent in anguish. S4a1n2d2ili1 blessed Garud2a, who
<>then got back his old feathers.
<NI>Continuing their journey Garud2a and Ga1lava reached
<>the palace of the very rich King, Yaya1ti. Garud2a intro-
<>duced Ga1lava to Yaya1ti, who found it difficult to get
<>800 horses for Ga1lava. But, Yaya1ti gave his daughter
<>Ma1dhavi1 to Ga1lava saying that he might give her to
<>any King and get money enough to purchase 800
<>horses. After thus showing the means to get money to
<>Ga1lava, Garud2a returned home.
<NI>Ga1lava gave Ma1dhavi1 first to King Haryas4va of
<>Ayodhya1, then to King Divoda1sa of Ka1s4i1 and next to
<>King Us4i1nara of Bhoja and got from them two hundred
<>horses each, and he submitted the horses and also
<>Ma1dhavi1 in lieu of the balance of two hundred horses
<>to Vis4va1mitra as daks2in2a1. A son called As2t2aka was born
<>to Vis4va1mitra by Ma1dhavi1, who had been granted a
<>boon that she would not lose her youth and beauty even
<>though she lived with any number of people. (Udyoga-
<>Parva Chapter 108).

<NI>16) {%Defeated by Va1suki.%} To churn the Milk-Ocean the
<>Devas and Asuras decided to use Mount Mandara as
<>the shaft and Va1suki as the rope to rotate the shaft.
<>The attempts of the Devas, the Asuras and the Bhu1taga-

<>mountain, when Garud2a, at the instance of Vis2n2u
<>brought the mountain as easily as a kite carries a frog.
<>Again, when others failed to bring Va1suki from na1ga-
<>loka Garud2a went and asked the na1ga chief to follow
<>him to the ocean of Milk. Va1suki replied that if his
<>presence was so indispensable he must be carried over
<>there. Then Garud2a caught the middle part of Va1suki
<>in his beak and rose in the air. But, even though
<>Garud2a rose beyond the horizon, when he looked down
<>half of Va1suki still remained on the ground. Garud2a
<>then tried to fold Va1suki into two and carry it, but,
<>again to no purpose. Disappointed and humiliated
<>Garud2a returned without Va1suki. Afterwards Va1suki
<>was brought to the ocean of Milk by S4iva's hand stret-

<>Kalha1ra flowers from the garden of Kubera were flown
<>to the feet of Pa1n5ca1li1. She wore the fragrant flowers in

<>by the Devas blessing him that as long as Uparicara-
<>vasu remained on earth he would not feel hungry and
<>that he would regain his old form due to the blessings
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Vasu prayed to Vis2n2u, who sent Garud2a

<>mother was a greater sin than disobeying a father.
<>Weighing the merits and demerits of the act Ciraka1ri1
<>sat thinking without doing anything.
<NI>Gautama when he reached the forest thought again
<>about Ahalya1 and her crime. After all what has she
<>done? A guest came to the a1s4rama and as duty bound
<>she welcomed him. It was indeed a great sin to have
<>killed her by her own son. Immersed in thoughts of
<>this kind, sad and repentant, Gautama returned to the
<>a1s4rama to find Ciraka1ri1 sitting silently deeply engross-
<>ed in thoughts. On seeing his father Ciraka1ri1 was
<>perplexed and he explained to his father about the good [Page286-a+ 64]
<>and bad effects of his order. Gautama was pleased at
<>this and he blessed him with long life.
<NI>4) {%How the disciple Utan3ga was tested.%} Utan3ga was the
<>best of the disciples of Gautama. So even when all
<>the other disciples were sent away Gautama asked
<>Utan3ga to continue as a disciple which Utan3ga did
<>most willingly. The disciple became old with grey
<>hairs. Then taking pity on him Gautama received
<>gurudaks2in2a1 from Utan3ga and sent him away with
<>blessings. (For details see under ‘Utan3ga’).
<NI>5) {%Curse of Ahalya1.%} Indra became a lover of Ahalya1
<>and slept with her. Gautama coming to know of that
<>cursed both Indra and Ahalya1. (For details see under
<>Ahalya1).
<NI>6) {%Other details regarding Gautama.%}
<NI>(i) Kalma1s2apa1da, King of Ayodhya1. lived for twelve
<>years as a demon following a curse of Vasis2t2ha. At
<>last he took refuge in Gautama and following his
<>advice went to Gokarn2a and doing penance there to
<>propitiate S4iva attained moks2a. (S4ivara1tri Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>(ii) It was sage Nodhas, alias Gautama, who composed
<>Su1kta 58, Man2d2ala one of R2gveda.
<NI>(iii) Laks2man2a, brother of S4ri1 Ra1ma, constructed a
<>palace called Vaijayanta near the a1s4rama of Gautama.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>ed Brahma1. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(vi) Gautama once blessed Dyumatsena, father of
<>Satyava1n, and said that he would regain his eyesight.
<>(S4loka 11. Chapter 298, Vana Parva).
<NI>(vii) When the war between the Pa1n2d2avas and Kau-
<>ravas broke out Gautama went to the Kuruks2etra
<>battlefield and advised Dron2a to stop the battle.
<>(S4loka 36, Chapter 190, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(viii) Gautama was also one of the many sages who
<>visited Bhi1s2ma while he was lying on his bed of
<>arrows.
<NI>(ix) Once Gautama built a hermitage on the top of
<>the mountain Pa1riya1tra and did penance there for
<>sixtythousand years. Ka1la, the God of time, then appear-
<>ed before him and Gautama received him well and
<>sent him away. (S4loka 10, Chapter 47, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>x) Once Gautama turned the moustache of Indra
<>green by a curse for showing disrespect to him. (S4loka
<>23, Chapter 352, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(xi) When Gautama was born, there was such bri-
<>lliance that the surrounding darkness was removed and
<>so the boy was named Gautama (Gau=light rays,
<>Tamas=darkness) to mean the remover of darkness.
<>(S4loka 94, Chapter 93, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(xii) Once Gautama instructed the King Vr2s2a1darbhi
<>on the evil of accepting rewards for good deeds. (S4loka
<>42, Chapter 93, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(xiii) Gautama was also one among the rs2is who swore

<HI>GAUTAMA II. A brahmin who was a member of the
<>court of Yudhis2t2hira. He was a member of Indrasabha1
<>also. This Gautama while he was living in Girivraja
<>had sexual relations with a S4u1dra woman from the
<>country of Us4i1nara and a son was born to them named [Page286-b+ 65]
<>Kaks2iva1n. (S4lokas 17, 18 and 3 of Chapters 4, 7 and
<>21 respectively of Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<HI>GAUTAMA III. An ascetic of great erudition. He had
<>three sons named Ekata, Dvita and Trita. (See under
<>‘Ekata’). (S4loka 79, Chapter 36, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA IV. Another ascetic of great virtue. Once
<>when this Gautama was going through the forest he
<>saw an elephant babe lying wearied. He took it to his
<>a1s4rama and brought it up. When it became a full
<>grown elephant Indra disguised as the emperor
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came to take it away secretly. Gautama
<>found it out and then he was offered thousand cows
<>and much wealth in lieu of the elephant. But Gautama
<>refused to part with the elephant. Pleased with his
<>extreme affection for his dependant, Indra took both
<>Gautama and the elephant to heaven. (Chapter 102,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA. V. An ungrateful brahmin. He was born
<>in Madhyades4a. He left his parents and after travelling
<>in many lands he came to a country of foresters. The
<>foresters received him with respect and he lived in a
<>hut of the foresters and married a lady from among
<>them.
<NI>Gautama abandoned his brahminhood and accepted
<>the duties of foresters. He was living like this when
<>another brahmin boy came to that village. He searched
<>in vain for a brahmin house to stay for the night and
<>then knowing that a man born a brahmin but made
<>a forester by his duties was living there he went to his
<>house. Gautama also came there carrying the animals
<>and birds he had hunted down that day. His body
<>was bathed in blood. The brahmin guest felt com-
<>passion for Gautama and advised him to leave his
<>trade and go to his house in his country.
<NI>In the morning the brahmin guest went away without
<>taking any food. The advice of his guest kept him
<>thinking. He decided to abandon his life as a hunter
<>and so leaving everything behind he went to the sea-
<>shore. He met some merchants on the way and while
<>they were travelling together a wild elephant attacked
<>them. Many were killed and Gautama escaping ran
<>swiftly and came to the base of a big banyan tree.
<>He was tired and slept there for a while.
<NI>A big vulture named Na1d2i1jam3gha lived on the top of
<>that banyan tree. He used to go out to worship Brahma1
<>at dusk and when he returned to his abode that day
<>he saw a man lying wearied down below. Gautama
<>attempted to catch the vulture and eat it but the
<>vulture playing a benign host placed before Gautama
<>food for him and made enquiries about him and asked
<>him the purpose of his travels. Gautama told him that
<>he was very poor and that he wanted to acquire some
<>wealth somehow.
<NI>Na1d2i1jam3gha then said that he would get for him enough
<>wealth from the demon-King Viru1pa1ks2a who was an
<>intimate friend of his. Gautama was pleased. The
<>vulture fanned him and sent him to sleep. Next morn-
<>ing Na1d2i1jam3gha sent Gautama to Viru1pa1ks2a and the
<>demon gave Gautama as much gold as he could carry
<>on his shoulders.
<NI>Gautama took the gold as a head load and came back
<>to the base of the banyan tree. Na1d2i1jam3gha came to him
<>and they talked to each other for some time. Gautama
<>who had become a gluttonous flesh eater looked with
<>greed at the fat body of the vulture and in an instant [Page287-a+ 64]
<>killed it and packed the flesh along with the load of
<>gold and went his way.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a did not see Na1d2i1jam3gha for two days and he
<>was worried. He, therefore, sent his son to the banyan
<>tree to look for Na1d2i1jam3gha. When he reached the
<>base of the tree he found to his grief only the bones
<>and feathers of his father's friend. He knew what had
<>happened and he immediately followed the ungrateful
<>brahmin and capturing him brought him to his father
<>bound hand and foot. Viru1pa1ks2a without any mercy
<>cut him into pieces and threw them for the crows to
<>eat. But even the crows would not eat the flesh of such
<>an ungrateful man.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a burnt the remains of Na1d2i1jam3gha in a
<>funeral pyre. Devas assembled in the skies to watch
<>the funeral. Then Surabhi sprinkled milk on the
<>funeral pyre and brought back Na1d2i1jam3gha to life.
<>The reborn vulture felt sorry for Gautama and request-
<>ed Surabhi to restore to life the wretched Gautama
<>also. Gautama also was brought back to life and he
<>embraced Na1d2i1jam3gha. Gautama then went away with
<>his load of gold.
<NI>Gautama returned to S4abara1laya and there married a
<>S4u1dra lady and begot evil sons. The devas were
<>offended at this and cursing him condemned him to
<>hell. (Chapters 168 to 173, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMI1 I. Another name of Kr2pi, wife of Dron2a.

<HI>GAVIJA1TA. (S4R2N3GI1). The son of a sage named
<>Na1gabhu1s2an2a, Gavija1ta cursed that King Pari1ks2it
<>should die of snake-bite. The curse was made under
<>the following circumstances.
<NI>King Pari1ks2it went hunting one day in the forest and
<>he who had chased a deer in hot haste for some dis-
<>tance felt naturally very weak and tired, and requested
<>a sage he saw there in the forest for some water.
<>Immersed in meditation the sage did not hear the King,
<>and mistaking him to be a haughty fellow, the King,
<>with his stick, lifted a dead snake and placed it round
<>the neck of the sage. Yet he did not stir. The King
<>returned to his palace. [Page287-b+ 65]
<NI>Gavija1ta, son of the sage and a devotee of Devi1 heard
<>of the insult heaped on his father's head while he was
<>merry-making in the forest with his companions. The
<>companions derided him by saying that though his
<>father was Na1gabhu1s2ana (having snakes as ornament)
<>the na1ga was I feless. Enraged at this and not waiting
<>to study details about the incident he pronounced the
<>following curse. “Whoever might be the person who
<>threw a dead snake about my father's neck, he will be
<>bitten to death by Taks2aka within seven days from
<>today.” Only after the curse was pronounced did he
<>understand that it was King Pari1ks2it who had become
<>the object of the curse. And, he despatched his disciple
<>immediately to Pari1ks2it to inform him about the curse.
<>The King's reaction was, “when the time for death
<>comes let me die.” (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Dviti1ya
<>Skandha).

<HI>GAYA1TI1RTHA. The following story is told in the Agni
<>Pura1n2a about the origin of this very reputed sacred
<>place at Gaya1.
<NI>An asura called Gaya was once performing
<>tapas here. As the intensity of his tapas went
<>on increasing, the Devas got nervous and they
<>approached Vis2n2u with the request that he should
<>save them from Gaya1sura. Vis2n2u agreed to oblige
<>them. Meantime the intensity of Gaya's tapas increa-
<>sed daily. Ultimately Vis2n2u appeared to Gaya and as
<>requested by him granted him the boon to the effect
<>that he would become more holy and sanctified than
<>all the ti1rthas in the world.
<NI>Brahma1 and other Devas became afraid of Gaya's
<>power and prowess and they complained about him to
<>Vis2n2u, who advised Brahma1 to request Gaya for his
<>body in order to perform a yajn5a. Brahma1 did so and
<>Gaya lay down on earth so that the Yajn5a might be
<>performed on his body. Brahma1 began the yajn5a on his
<>head, and made an offering when the body of Gaya
<>was not stationary or quiet. When told about this fact
<>Vis2n2u called up Dharmadeva (See Mari1ci, Para 3) and
<>told him thus: “You please hold devas4ila1 (a divine
<>stone) on the body of Gaya, and let all the Devas sit
<>upon it, and I shall be seated on the stone along with
<>the Devas, holding the gada1 (club) in my hands.”
<NI>Dharmadeva did as he was bidden by Vis2n2u. The body
<>of Gaya stopped shaking as soon as Vis2n2u sat upon the
<>stone, and Brahma1 made the full offerings. Thenceforth
<>the place became a holy tirtha under the name Gaya1.
<>After the yajn5a was over Brahma1 gave the Gaya temple
<>20,000 yards (5 Kros4a) in extent with 55 villages
<>attached to it as daks2in2a1 (fee) to the masters of the
<>ceremony. Brahma1 presented the villages to them after
<>creating therein hills purely of gold, rivers flowing
<>with milk and honey, houses built of Gold and silver
<>etc. But the brahmins who got these gifts stayed on
<>there, their avarice only on the increase perhaps.
<>Angry at this Brahma1 cursed the people of Gaya1, and
<>according to it the brahmins became illiterate and evil-
<>minded; rivers flowed with water instead of milk and
<>honey. The brahmins lamenting over their evil fate
<>submitted their grievances before Brahma1, who consol-
<>ed them thus: Well, brahmins of Gaya1, as long as
<>there exist the sun and the moon you will continue
<>to be dependent upon the Gaya1 ti1rtha for your sus-
<>tenance. Whoever comes to Gaya1 and gives offerings
<>to you and performs the due rites for the souls of the
<>departed, the souls of hundred generations of his
<>ancestors will be transfered from hell to heaven where
<>they will attain final beatitude.”
<NI>Thus did Gaya1ti1rtha become famous. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 144).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 I. One of the seven horses of Su1rya. The
<>other horses are Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1, Tris2t2ubh, [Page288-b+ 65]
<>Anus2t2ubh, and Pan3kti. (Chapter 8, Am3s4am 2, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 II.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A glorious Vedic mantra. This
<>mantra has twentyfour letters. There are nineteen
<>categories of movable and immovable things in this world
<>and to this if the five elements are added the number
<>twentyfour is obtained. That is why the Ga1yatri1 has got
<>twentyfour letters. (Chapter 4, Bhi1s2ma Parva). At the
<>time of Tripura dahana S4iva hung this Ga1yatri1 mantra
<>as a string on the top of his chariot (Chapter 34, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>2) {%The glory of Ga1yatri1.%} If one recites Ga1yatri1 once one
<>will be freed from all sins done at that time; if one
<>recites it ten times all the sins done on one day will be
<>washed away. Thus, if one recites it a hundred times
<>the sins of one month; thousand times, the sins of a
<>year; one lakh times, the sins of his life time; ten lakh
<>times, the sins of his previous birth; hundred lakh times,
<>the sins of all his births, will be washed away, If a
<>man recites it ten crore times he becomes a realised
<>soul and attains moks2a. (Navama Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How to recite Ga1yatri1.%} It should be recited sitting
<>still with your head slightly drawn downwards with
<>your right palm open upwards, with the fingers raised
<>and bent to give the shape of the hood of a snake.
<>Starting from the centre of the ring-finger and counting
<>down and going up through the centre of the small
<>finger and touching the top lines on the ring, middle and
<>forefingers, count down to the base of the forefinger,
<>you get number ten. This is how the number of recita-
<>tions is counted. This method is called the Karama1la1
<>(hand rosary) method. This is not the only method
<>that could be used. You can use a rosary made of
<>lotus seeds or glass beads. If you are using lotus seeds
<>you should select white seeds for the rosary. (Navama
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>GA1YATRI1STHA1NA. A sacred place of northern Bha1-
<>rata. If one spends one night here one will get the
<>benefit of giving away as gifts a thousand cows. (S4loka
<>28, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<HI>GERU. A mineral obtained from mountains. (S4loka 95,
<>Chapter 158, Vana Parva).
<HI>GH ({#G#}). This letter has two meanings: (1) Bell (2) a
<>blow or assault; striking or killing. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 348).
<HI>GHANAPA1T2HA. A particular system of Vedic studies.
<>There are four such systems. The system of separating
<>each word from conjunctions and combinations and
<>combining with the word just before and after it is
<>called Jat2a1pa1t2ha. Jat2a1pa1t2ha means joined or combined
<>Pa1t2ha. Ghanapa1t2ha is there to avoid errors in Jat2a1pa1t2ha
<>Ghanapa1t2ha consists of padapa1t2ha and Kramapa1t2ha.
<>In Padapa1t2ha the split words are once more combined
<>and Pra1tis4a1khya lays down the rules to combine words.
<>It is because of this scientific system of reciting that
<>the R2gveda remains to this day pure in text without
<>different readings.
<HI>GHAN2T2A. I. A brahmin born in Vasis2t2ha's family. He
<>spent hundred years worshipping S4iva. Once Ghan2t2a
<>asked sage Devala to give his daughter in marriage to
<>him. But Ghan2t2a's ugliness stood in the way. So he
<>abducted the daughter of the sage and married her.
<>Enraged at this Devala cursed and turned him into an [Page289-a+ 62]
<>owl. He was also given redemption from the curse that
<>he would regain his form the day he helped Indra-
<>dyumna. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>GHAN2T2A II. See under Ghan2t2a1karn2a.
<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A I.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ghan2t2a and Karn2a were two Ra1ks2asa bro-
<>thers who attained salvation by worshipping Vis2n2u.
<>(Bha1gavata, das4ama Skandha). But the elder brother,
<>Ghan2t2a alone is sometimes called by the name Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is a reference in Da1rukavadha (killing
<>of Da1ruka1sura) about the birth of Ghan2t2a1kar2n2a.
<>Da1ruka, after having secured a boon from Brahma1, used
<>to harass the world too much and when his depre-
<>dation hecame unbearable S4iva created Bhadraka1li1
<>from his third eye and she killed the asura. Mandodari1
<>wife of Da1ruka and daughter of Maya was sunk in
<>grief at the death of her husband. She began to do
<>tapas. S4iva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
<>from his body saying that the person on whom she
<>sprinkled the sweat drops would suffer from small-pox
<>and that such patients would worship her (Mandodari1)
<>and supply her necessary food. From that day onwards
<>Mandodari1 became the presiding deity over small-pox.
<>On her way back to the earth with the sweat-drops
<>Mandodari1 met Bhadraka1li1 at whom she threw the sweat-
<>drops to take revenge for her husband's death. Immedi-
<>ately Bhadraka1li1 fell down with an attack of small-pox.
<>Hearing about the mishap S4iva created a terrible
<>Ra1ks2asa called Ghan2t2a1karn2a. According to S4iva's
<>directions Ghan2t2a1karn2a licked off the small-pox from
<>Bhadraka1li1's body. But, when he tried to lick it off from
<>her face she prevented him saying that she and Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a were sister and brother and that it was improper
<>for the brother to lick the face of the sister. And, even
<>to this day the small-pox on Bhadraka1li1's face remains
<>as an ornament to her.
<NI>3) {%The name Ghan2t2a1karn2a.%} This Ra1ks2asa, at first, was
<>an enemy of Vis2n2u, and did not tolerate even the men-
<>tion of Vis2n2u's name. Therefore, he went about always
<>wearing a bell so that the tinkling of it warded off the
<>name of Vis2n2u from entering his ears. Because he wore
<>a ghan2t2a1 (bell) in his Karn2as (ears) he came to be
<>known as Ghan2t2a1karn2a. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 80).
<NI>4) {%Turned out to be a devotee of Vis2n2u.%} Ghan2t2a1karn2a
<>became a servant of Kubera. Once he did tapas for
<>salvation. S4iva appeared and asked him to do tapas to
<>please Vis2n2u as Vis2n2u was greater than himself (S4iva).
<>From that day onwards he removed the bells from his
<>ears and became a devotee of Vis2n2u. (Bhavis2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 80).
<NI>5) {%Attained salvation.%} Handing over charge of govern-
<>ment to Sa1tyaki S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once went to Kaila1sa moun-
<>ted on Garud2a to see S4iva. On his way he dismounted
<>at the Badarya1s4rama, and while sitting deep in medi-
<>tation there he heard the thundering voice of Pis4a1cas
<>(souls of dead people roaming about without attaining
<>salvation). He also heard the barking of dogs, and thus
<>he understood that Pis4a1cas were hunting animals. The

<>Ghan2t2a1karn2a who was reciting the name of Vis2n2u. S4ri1 [Page289-b+ 64]
<>Kr2s2n2a felt pity for him. Ghan2t2a1karn2a told Kr2s2n2a that
<>his aim and ambition were to see Vis2n2u and that S4iva
<>had blessed that he would realise his ambition at
<>Badarya1s4rama. Pleased at all this, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a revealed
<>his Vis4varu1pa (representing in his person the whole
<>universe), and at once Ghan2t2a1karn2a brought half of the
<>corpse of a brahmin and submitted it as a present
<>before the Lord. He explained to Kr2s2n2a that according
<>to the custom of the Ra1ks2asas that was the best present
<>which could be made. Without accepting the present
<>Kr2s2n2a patted Ghan2t2a1karn2a on his back with the result
<>that he cast off his body and rose up to Vaikun2t2ha.

<>attained Vaikun2t2ha due to the blessings of God Al-
<>mighty his idol is still installed in temples and wor-
<>shipped. The installation ceremony is described in
<>Chapter 59 of the Agni Pura1n2a thus: “Ghan2t2a1karn2a

<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A II. One of the four attendants pre-

<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 63).
<HI>GHAT2A. A notorious thief. He had a friend called
<>Karpara. They were jointly known as Gha1t2akarparas.
<>Once both the friends went to commit theft. Leaving
<>Ghat2a at the door-steps Karpara entered the chamber
<>of the princess who after enjoying sexual pleasures
<>with him gave him some money asking him to repeat
<>such visits in future. Karpara told Ghat2a all that had
<>happened and handed over to him the money which the
<>princess had given him. Karpara went again to the
<>princess. But, owing to the weariness caused by the
<>night's enjoyment both the princess and he slept till late
<>in the morning. Meantime the palace guards found out
<>the secret and took the lovers into custody. Karpara
<>was sentenced to death and led out to be hanged. Ghat2a
<>was present on the spot and Karpara asked him secretly
<>to save the princess. Accordingly Ghat2a, without any-
<>body knowing about it, took the princess over to his
<>house.
<NI>The King ordered enquiries about the absence of the
<>princess. Under the natural presumption that some
<>relation or other of Karpara alone might have carried
<>away his daughter the King ordered the guards of Kar-
<>para's corpse to arrest anybody who approached the
<>corpse and expressed grief. Ghat2a came to know of this
<>secret order of the King. Next day evening Ghat2a posing
<>himself as a drunkard and with a servant disguised as
<F>1. According to certain Pura1nas Ghan2t2a1karn2as are two individuals, Ghan2t2a and Karn2a. The term Ghan2t2a1karn2a--singular number--

<>a woman walking in front and with another servant
<>carrying rice mixed with dhatu1ra1 (a poisonous fruit)

<>Ghat2a used the opportunity to burn the corpse of
<>Karpara there itself. After that Ghat2a disappeared.
<NI>The King then deputed new guards to watch over the
<>funeral pyre of Karpara as he anticipated some one to
<>come to pick his charred bones from the pyre. But,
<>Ghat2a put the guards into a swoon by a mantra he had
<>learned from a sannya1sin and went away with the bones
<>of his friend.
<NI>Realising now that further stay there was not safe Ghat2a
<>left the place with the princess and the sannya1sin. But,
<>the princess, who had already fallen in love with the
<>sannya1sin poisoned Ghat2a to death.
<HI>GHAT2AJA1NUKA. A sage who was a prominent member

<HI>GHAT2AKARPARA. One of the nine great poets in

<>court.
<NI>“Dhanvantari--Ks2apan2ak A1marasim3ha--S4an3ku--Veta1la-
<>bhat2t2a--Ghat2akarpara--Ka1lida1sa1h2”. A poem of twen-
<>ty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghat2akarpara ka1vya is
<>attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message
<>despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently
<>been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating
<>a word or set of words to convey different meanings at
<>the end of each line). By composing a poem called
<>‘Nalodaya’, Ka1lida1sa answered the challenge posed by
<>Ghat2akarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghat2akarpara
<>answered Ka1lida1sa in the following stanza.
<Poem>Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te
<>nimajjati1ndoriti yo babha1s2e /
<>nu1nam na dr2s2t2am3 kavina1pi tena
<>da1ridryados2o gun2ara1s4ina1s4i1.</Poem>
<>(Ka1lida1sa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kuma1rasam3bhava
<>had written ‘Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te nimajjati1ndoh2
<>kiran2es2viva1n3kah2”. In the above verse by Ghat2akarpara
<>the usage ‘Kavina1pi tena’ may be interpreted in two
<>ways, viz. Kavina1+api+tena and Kavi+na1pitena. By
<>the second combination Ghat2akarpara converted Ka1li-
<>da1sa into a barber (na1pita).
<HI>GHAT2IKA1. A measure of time equal to 24 minutes.
<>Sixty vina1d2ika1s make one Ghat2ika1. (See Ka1lama1na).
<HI>GHAT2OTKACA.

<>important part in the story of Maha1bha1rata. He was,
<>from his very birth, a staunch friend and ally of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He courted a hero's death in the great war.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} On the burning of the ‘lac Palace’ the
<>Pa1n2d2avas escaped through a tunnel and reached a forest.
<>While they were sleeping on the ground, Hid2im3ba the
<>Ra1ks2asa chief in the forest saw the Pa1n2d2avas from the
<>top of a tree, and he deputed his sister Hid2imbi1 to
<>bring over the Pa1n2d2avas to him for food.
<NI>Hid2im3bi1 approached the Pa1n2d2avas in the guise of a
<>beautiful woman. She was attracted towards Bhi1ma
<>and she prayed for the return of his love, which Bhi1ma
<>refused. Impatient at the delay Hid2im3ba rushed to-
<>wards the Pa1n2d2avas, and in the duel that ensued
<>between him and Bhi1ma, he was killed by Bhi1ma. [Page290-b+ 65]
<NI>Then Hid2im3bi1 approached Kunti1 and requested her to
<>ask Bhi1ma to marry her. The Pa1n2d2avas agreed to the
<>proposal on condition that Bhi1ma and Hid2im3bi1 should
<>enjoy their honeymoon in the forest and on mountains,
<>but Bhi1ma should return to them at dusk everyday.
<>Ghat2otkaca was the son born to Bhi1ma and Hid2imbi1,

<>return to them whenever any need arose for it.
<NI>3) {%Carried the Pa1n2d2avas on shoulders.%} During their exile
<>in the forest the Pa1n2d2avas became too tired to walk any
<>further when Bhi1ma remembered Ghat2otkaca, who

<>Ghat2otkaca carrying Pa1n5ca1li1 on his shoulders, and the
<>Ra1ks2asas carrying the Pa1n2d2ava brothers on their
<>shoulders went by air to Badarika1s4rama where
<>Narana1ra1yan2as were doing tapas, landed them there,

<NI>(14) Karn2a clashed with Ghat2otkaca and failing to
<>kill him by any means he (Karn2a) used Vaijayanti1
<>S4akti as the last resort. This S4akti had been given to
<>him by Indra in exchange for his head-gear and ear-
<>rings, and Karn2a had been keeping the S4akti in res-
<>erve to kill Arjuna. At any rate Karn2a used it against [Page291-a+ 65]

<>kaca the S4akti entered the sphere of the stars. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 180).

<>grand-daughter of Dr2gata mahars2i and daughter of sage
<>Kaks2i1va1n. As she contracted leprosy in her very child-
<>hood nobody came forward to marry her. Ultimately
<>she composed a mantra in praise of As4vini1devas. They

<>of Gharman and father of Vidus2a. (Agni Pura1n2a,

<HI>GHR2TA1CI1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} She was an exceptionally beautiful apsara1
<>woman, and she revelled in disturbing the peace of
<>the sages and becoming mother of children by them.
<>Ghr2ta1ci1, who succeeded in breaking the penance of
<>the sages like Kus4ana1bha, Vya1sa and Bharadva1ja
<>occupied a very prominent position among apsara1
<>women.
<NI>2) {%S4uka, the son of Vya1sa.%} Vya1sa longed very much to have
<>a son. Ultimately, after receiving instruction and advice
<>from Na1rada, he reached the peaks of Maha1meru and
<>worshipped Maha1deva and Maha1devi1 for one year
<>with the one-syllabled mantra OM which is the very
<>seed of word. By now the great tejas (effulgence) of
<>Vya1sa lighted up the whole world and Indra got ner-
<>vous and upset. The great Lord S4iva appeared on the
<>scene and blessed Vya1sa that he will have a son who
<>would become a very wise man, very much interested
<>in helping others, and very famous also. Vya1sa returned
<>gratified to his a1s4rama. One day, while in the process
<>of preparing the sticks for producing fire, thoughts [Page291-b+ 64]
<>about a son passed through his mind. Fire is produced by
<>the rubbing of two sticks. But, he thought, how
<>could he who had no wife, become the father of a son?
<>While immersed in such thoughts he saw Ghr2ta1ci1
<>standing near him, herself having come along the sky.

<>the curse of Vya1sa she assumed the form of a parrot and
<>flew away.
<NI>The beauty of Ghr2ta1ci1 as also the flight of the parrot
<>kindled erotic feelings in Vya1sa and seminal emission
<>occurred. The semen fell on the stick used for produc-
<>ing fire, and without knowing the fact he went on
<>using the sticks for producing fire. And, then did
<>appear from it a son of divine lustre. That son became
<>reputed in later years as sage S4uka. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Prathama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Two children by Bharadva1ja.%} Once sage Bharadva1ja was
<>taking his bath in the Gan3ga1, Ghr2ta1ci1 also came to
<>bathe. On the banks of the river her clothes caught
<>something and were removed from their position. The
<>sight of it caused seminal emission to the Sage. The
<>semen thus emitted was kept in a Dron2a, (bamboo cup)
<>and when it was due the Dron2a broke and out
<>of it came a child. It was this child which, in later
<>years, became so very famous as the great Dron2a1ca1rya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 149). On another occasion also,
<>the sight of Ghr2ta1ci1 caused emission in Bharadva1ja,
<>and S4ruta1vati1 or S4ruva1vati1 was the noble daughter
<>born out of it. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 63).
<NI>{%Hundred daughters of Kus4ana1bha.%} Kus4ana1bha, son of Kus4a
<>was a saintly king. Once Kus4ana1bha fell in love with
<>Ghr2ta1ci1 and a hundred daughters were born to him

<>hundred girls, but they refused to satisfy his desire. So
<>he cursed them to become crooked or bent down in body.
<>Later on, Brahmadatta, son of the sage Cu1li, straightened
<>their bodies and married them. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Canto 32).

<>As2t2a1vakra, who introduced her into Kubera's assembly.

<HI>GODHA. A village in the north-east part of ancient
<>India. (S4loka 42, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>GODILA I. A Sa1mavedamu1rti. By his curse Utatthya
<>became a dunce and later became famous as Satyatapas.
<>(For details see under Satyatapas).
<HI>GODILA II. A servant of Vais4ravan2a. Once when
<>Godila was travelling by air he saw Padma1vati1, wife [Page293-a+ 65]
<>of Ugrasena, King of Vidarbha, bathing in a pond
<>along with her companions. The very sight of the
<>enchanting Padma1vati1 roused carnal passions in him
<>and the Yaks2a took the form of Ugrasena and started
<>singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padma1vati1
<>went to him because she mistook him for her husband.
<>Embracing her passionately the Yaks2a outraged her
<>modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts
<>in Padma1vati1 and, on being questioned, the Yaks2a told
<>the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOHARAN2APARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of
<>Maha1bha1rata. See under ‘Maha1bha1rata’.
<HI>GOHATYA1. In ancient India killing of cows was con-
<>sidered to be a great sin. It is interesting to note the
<>punishment prescribed for this crime in the Agni
<>Pura1n2a. For one month he should drink barley water
<>only. He should live in a cow-shed wearing the hide of
<>the cow he has killed. He can have some supper and
<>that too without salt He must bathe for two months in
<>cow's urine. During day time he should follow the cows
<>looking after their comfort. He should drink the
<>menstrual discharge with his face lifted upwards.
<>Fasting, he should give away as charity ten cows and a
<>bull. If not, he should give as charity all his wealth to
<>god-fearing brahmins. If a man only stops the cow for
<>others to kill he should bear a fourth of the punishment;
<>if he stops and ties it for killing he should bear half of
<>the punishment and if he stops it, ties it and gives the
<>weapon for killing he should bear three-fourths of the
<>punishment. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 159),
<HI>GOKHALI. One of the disciples in the tradition of
<>Vya1sa. He was the direct disciple of S4a1kalya. S4a1kalya
<>divided the branch of Veda he received into six and

<>Va1lga1yana, Maudgalya, S4a1li, A1dis4is4ira, Gokhali, and
<>Ya1tukarn2a. (Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>GOKARN2A I. See under Gokarn2a.
<HI>GOKARN2A II. An incarnation of S4iva. In the seventh
<>Vara1hakalpa S4iva was born as Gokarn2a and he then
<>got four sons named, Kas4yapa, Us4anas, Cyavana and
<>Br2haspati. (S4atarudrasam3hita1, S4iva Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOKARN2A1. In the great battle Karn2a sent a serpent-
<>missile against Arjuna. The serpent named As4vasena
<>was the power behind the missile and Gokarn2a1 was the
<>mother of that serpent. (S4loka 42, Chapter 90, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<HI>GOKARN2A. A sacred place of Pura1n2ic importance
<>situated on the extreme north of Kerala.
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} There was once on the banks of the river,
<>Tun3gabhadra1, a village made sacred and prosperous by
<>the brahmins who lived there. In that village lived a
<>noble brahmin named A1tmadeva. His wife was a
<>quarrelsome woman named Dhundhuli1. Even after many
<>years of married life they got no children and
<>A1tmadeva, greatly grief-stricken, left his home and
<>went to the forests. He was sitting on the shore of a
<>lake after quenching his thirst from it when a
<>Sannya1sin came that way. A1tmadeva told him about his
<>domestic life and pleaded that he should suggest a way to
<>get a son for him. The sannya1sin sat in meditation for
<>some time and contemplated on the horoscope of
<>A1tmadeva and regretfully informed him that according
<>to his horoscope he was to have no children for seven
<>successive births. He, therefore, advised A1tmadeva to [Page293-b+ 65]
<>abandon all his worldly pleasures and accept sannya1sa
<>for the rest of his life. But A1tmadeva was not to be
<>discouraged by this prophecy and he urged the
<>sannya1sin to help him somehow to get a child. The
<>sanya1sin then gave him a fruit and asked him to give it
<>to his wife and ask her to observe a life of fasting for a
<>period of one year.
<NI>Greatly pleased with this boon A1tmadeva returned to
<>his house and told his wife all that had happened and
<>gave her the fruit. She liked to eat the fruit but a
<>year's fasting seemed troublesome to her. She was
<>thinking of how to get over this difficulty when her
<>younger sister came to her and suggested a plan. She
<>said “Sister, I am pregnant. I shall give you the
<>child I deliver. You can declare it as your child and
<>make your husband believe so. You can announce in
<>public that you have eaten the fruit and have conse-
<>quently become pregnant. We can, to test its merit,
<>give the fruit to a cow.” Dhundhuli1 liked the plan very
<>much and so did everything like that.
<NI>The news that Dhundhuli1 was pregnant spread in the
<>city. Very soon her sister gave birth to a child and
<>that child was proclaimed as the child of Dhundhuli1. On
<>the pretext that Dhundhuli1 was short of breast-milk her
<>sister started doing the breast-feeding. The child was
<>named Dhundhuka1ri.
<NI>After three months the cow that ate the fruit delivered
<>a child. The ear of the child was like that of a cow
<>and so he was called Gokarn2a. Dhundhuka1ri and
<>Gokarn2a grew together. Dhundhuka1ri became a very
<>evil-natured boy while Gokarn2a grew into a scholarly
<>one. Dhundhuka1ri who was the very seat of everything
<>bad made the life of their parents wretched and the
<>disappointed A1tmadeva renounced all and went to the
<>forests and did penance and attained moks2a. Unable
<>to bear the torture by her son, Dhundhuli1 committed
<>suicide by jumping into a well. Gokarn2a started on a
<>pilgrimage.
<NI>Dhundhuka1ri lived in his own house surrounded by
<>prostitutes. Thieving was his only means of livelihood.
<>Knowing this the servants of the king started to capture
<>Dhundhuka1ri and the prostitutes who lived with him,
<>for their safety, bound Dhundhuka1ri with ropes and put
<>him into fire and killed him. The soul of Dhundhuka1ri
<>became a great phantom. Hearing the news of the
<>death of his brother, Gokarn2a returned home. He
<>conducted a s4ra1ddha at Gaya1 to give peace to the soul
<>of his departed brother. But the phantom of Dhundhu-
<>ka1ri was not pacified. This phantom troubled him
<>always. Gokarn2a was not afraid of it and asked him
<>what he wanted and the phantom pleaded that in some
<>way Gokarn2a should get him absolved of all his sins.
<>Gokarn2a then consulted Pandits to know what method
<>should be adopted to save a soul which could not be
<>saved even by a Gaya1-S4ra1ddha. The Pandits advised
<>him to do penance to propitiate the Sun. The Sun who
<>appeared before Gokarn2a as a result of his penance
<>declared that if he did read the entire Bha1gavata in
<>seven days Dhundhuka1ri would get moks2a. So Gokarn2a
<>performed a Sapta1ha and among those who assembled
<>to hear it was the phantom of Dhundhuka1ri also. The
<>phantom finding no place to sit crept into a seven-
<>layered bamboo and sat there listening to Gokarn2a.
<>When the first day was over the first layer broke and it
<>went on like that every day and on the seventh day the [Page294-a+ 63]
<>seventh layer broke and when Gokarn2a finished
<>the twelfth Skandha the phantom rose from the
<>bamboo to heaven. When it was going to heaven it
<>looked at Gokarn2a and told him that his moks2a was due
<>to the result of his hearing the sapta1ha reading. When
<>Gokarn2a asked him why none of the others who heard
<>it got it he said that it was because none had heard it
<>with such rapt attention as he had done.
<NI>Gokarn2a then conducted another reading of Sapta1ha
<>and the people present heard the same with rapt
<>attention. When the reading was over, a chariot of
<>Vis2n2u from Vaikun2t2ha descended and carried
<>away all those who heard the reading. The place
<>where Gokarn2a sat and read the Sapta1ha became
<>known later as the famous Gokarn2a. (Chapters 1 to 3,
<>Bha1gavata Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>2) {%Mitrasaha and Gokarn2a.%} A King of Ayodhya1 named
<>Mitrasaha who became famous by the name of
<>Kalma1s2apa1da, became a demon by a curse of Vasis2t2ha.
<>He attained moks2a by living and worshipping God in
<>the temple at Gokarn2a. (See under S4ivara1tri for
<>details).
<NI>3) {%Gokarn2a and the origin of Kerala.%} Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>gives a story associating Gokarn2a with the origin of
<>Kerala.
<NI>By the request of Bhagi1ratha the river Gan3ga1 fell on
<>earth and flowing as different brooks emptied its waters
<>in the ocean. The level of the water in the ocean went
<>up and the temple of Gokarn2a and the land of Kerala
<>were submerged in waters. The sages who were in the
<>temple somehow escaped and took refuge on the
<>mountain Sahya. Paras4ura1ma was doing penance there
<>then and the sages went to him and told him of their
<>plight. Paras4ura1ma went and stood in Gokarn2a and
<>threw an axe to the south. All the land from Gokarn2a
<>up to the place where the axe fell rose up from the
<>ocean to form a piece of land which was named Kerala.

<>dhana and it was enough if they worshipped that moun-
<>tain and so the residents of Amba1d2i started worshipping
<>the mountain. Indra got enraged at this and sent heavy
<>rains to Amba1d2i1 intending to submerge it in water. But
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a lifted the mountain over Amba1d2i like an um-

<HI>GRAHAS (PLANETS). Indians from very ancient days
<>have maintained certain definite ideas and inferences
<>about the planets. Though those ideas differ somewhat
<>from the results of modern researches, the influence of
<>the ancient ideas is discernible in all the Pura1n2ic texts in
<>India. The main ideas are summarised below.
<NI>Su1rya (Sun), Candra (Moon), S4ukra (Venus), Budha
<>(Mercury), Kuja (Mars), Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani
<>(Saturn), Ra1hu and Ketu are the navagrahas (the nine
<>planets).

<>Besides the above nine planets, Indian astronomers take
<>into account a starry sphere in the sky called Saptars2is
<>and the star called Dhruva.
<NI>1) {%Su1rya.%} The sun gives light to all the other planets.
<>It has an area of 50 crore yojanas and its distance from
<>the earth is 22 crore yojanas. S4u1rya exists within the
<>universe, and is called also Ma1rtan2d2a as it originated
<>from dead (mr2ta) egg (an2d2a). Su1rya divides the sky,
<>heaven, hell, the earth, east, west, north, south etc.
<>from one another. According to the course of Su1rya
<>three periods of time or ‘seasons’ like uttara1yan2a,
<>daks2in2a1yana and vis2uvat are caused. Five months from
<>May is the uttara1yan2a period, five months from
<>November the daks2in2a1yana period, and the months of
<>April and October are the Vis2uvats. Since during the
<>uttara1yan2a the sun rises up comparatively slowly
<>(mandagati) during this period the day is longer than
<>night. As in daks2in2a1yana the course of the sun is quic-
<>ker in pace (S4i1ghragati) night is longer than day, and
<>during vis2uvat, (samagati) day and night are of equal
<>duration.
<NI>The other planets have three positions called Jaradgava,
<>Aira1vata and Vais4va1nara, the first being the central
<>position, the second the northern position and the
<>third the southern position. Nine stars, As4vini1, Bharan2i1,
<>Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu and
<>Pus2ya occupy the Aira1vata vi1thi1 (northern position
<>or segment). Another nine stars, Magha1, Pu1rva
<>Phalguni1, Uttara Phalguni1, Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti1,
<>Vis4akha1, Anura1dha1 and Jyes2t2ha1 occupy the central
<>position, and the last nine stars, Mu1la, Purva1s2a1d2ha,
<>Uttara1s2a1d2ha, S4ravan2a, S4ravis2t2ha1, S4atabhis2ak, Pu1rva-
<>pros2t2hapada, Uttarapros2t2hapada and Revati1 occupy the

<NI>To the east, south, west and north of Mount Maha1meru
<>exist Devadha1nika1 (Indrapuri1) Sam3yamani1 (Yamapuri1)
<>N3imlocani1 (Varun2apuri1) and Vibha1vari1 (Kuberapuri1)
<>respectively. When Su1rya appears in Devadha1nika1 it
<>will be dawn, when he has travelled to Sam3yamani1 it
<>will be noon, when he is in Nimlocani1 it will be sunset
<>and when he is in Vibha1vari1 it will be mid-night. This
<>is how S4urya circles the Maha1meru. Within 15 na1d2ika1s
<>(6 hours) the sun travels 2(1/2) crores plus 2(1/2) lakhs of
<>yojanas. Su1rya's chariot has one wheel and twelve
<>spokes. The wheel represents a year and the twelve
<>spokes stand for the twelve months of the year. The
<>chariot has also three na1bhis representing the three
<>ca1turma1syas, and six bands representing the six
<>seasons. The height of the chariot is 36 lakhs yojanas
<>and it has a width of 8 yojanas inside. Arun2adeva is the
<>charioteer, and the seven chandas are the horses. The
<>seven chandas are, Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1,
<>Tris2t2ubh, Anus2t2ubh and Pan3kti).
<NI>Night is called Us2a1 and day Vyus2t2i and the time in
<>between is Sandhya1. When Sandhya1 begins the terrible
<>Ra1ks2asas called Mandehas attempt to consume Su1rya.
<>They have been granted the boon that everyday they
<>will be dying though they may not be losing their
<>bodies. So, everyday there rages a fierce fight between
<>them and Su1rya. When the fight is on, noble brahmins
<>throw up water sanctified by Ga1yatri1 mantra with
<>‘Om’. The water turns into Vajra1yudha and burns the
<>Ra1ks2asas to ashes. The first offering in Agnihotra is
<>made with the recitation of the mantra beginning
<>‘Su1ryo Jyoti’ because of which the sun is able to shine [Page296-b+ 65]
<>with thousands of rays with the result that the Ra1ks2asas
<>are burned to death. The Ba1lakhilyas who number
<>more than 60,000 form Su1rya1's body-guard. (See under
<>Su1rya for Pura1n2i1c stories about him).
<NI>2) {%Candra. (The Moon).%} Candra exists at one lakh
<>yojanas away from Su1rya, and it revolves round the
<>earth. A ca1ndra month of twentyseven days is divided
<>into twelve ra1s4is (houses) viz. Sim3ha (Leo), Kanya1
<>(Virgo) Tula1 (Libra) Vr2s4cika (Scorpio) Dhanus
<>(Sagittarius) Makara (Capricorn) Kum3bha (Aquarius)
<>Mi1na (Pisces) Mes2a (Aries) Vr2s2abha (Taurus)
<>Mithuna (Gemini) and Karkat2aka (Cancer). Every
<>month Candra stays in each of the above houses only
<>for 2(1/4) days.
<NI>The full moon makes Pitr2s happy, divides the month
<>into two halves, Kr2s2n2a Paks2a (the dark fortnight)
<>and S4ukla Paks2a (the bright fortnight) and functions
<>as the very life of all living beings. The twentyseven
<>stars from As4vini1 to Revati1 are the wives of Candra.
<>There is another view that Candra has twentyeight
<>wives including another star called Abhijit. Candra has
<>another name, Sarvamaya. Candra with his pleasing
<>rays, as sweet as Amr2ta (Nectar) bestows happiness on
<>devas, Pitr2s and all other living beings. So he is called
<>Sarvamaya.
<NI>Candra's chariot has three wheels. Ten beautiful horses
<>white as Jasmine flowers draw the chariot. These
<>horses also like those of Su1rya live for a Kalpa era.
<>Because the Devas drink its digits Candra wanes into
<>one digit (Kala1). Then Su1rya makes him wax again
<>with one single ray of his called Sus2umna1. When only
<>two Kala1s of his remain Candra enters the orbit of
<>Su1rya and stays there in the ray called ‘ama1’, and that
<>day, therefore is called ama1va1sya1. And on that day
<>Candra enters waters for the first time, and after that
<>dwells in trees, creepers etc. While Candra is thus in
<>trees etc. those who cut them will be committing the
<>sin of brahmahatya1. (slaughter of a brahmin). When
<>only a little of the 15th kala1 remains on new moon day
<>hordes of Pitr2s gather round the enfeebled Candra to
<>drink him, and they drink the amr2ta kala1, one of the
<>two kala1s still remaining with him. Thus the three
<>classes of Pitr2s, Barhis2adas, Saumyas and Agnis2va1ttas
<>get absolutely satisfied for one month. Thus Candra
<>nurtures Devas in the S4ukla Paks2a and pitr2s in Kr2s2n2a
<>Paks2a, and grows trees, creepers etc. with life-giving
<>water. (For details see under Candra).
<NI>3) {%S4ukra (Venus).%} S4ukra is an auspicious Deva very
<>much interested in doing good to the world and making
<>people happy. His course is also, like that of S4u1rya, of
<>three types, intense (quick), slow and of equal pace.
<>Two-and-a-half yojanas above Su1rya, S4ukra follows a
<>course alternating in front of and behind Su1rya. S4ukra
<>never goes very far away from S4u1rya, and he possesses
<>a big chariot drawn by horses from earth. (For details
<>see under S4ukra).
<NI>4) {%Budha (Mercury).%} Though inherently auspicious
<>Budha, in contact with inauspicious planets takes their
<>character and becomes weak. Budha also has the three
<>paces, quick, slow and medium. Budha moves close to
<>Su1rya and if he moves from Su1rya storms, failure of
<>rain etc. will be the result. He is considered to be the
<>son of Candra. His chariot is made of wind and fire,
<>golden in colour and is drawn by eight horses having
<>the speed of wind. (See under Budha for more details). [Page297-a+ 65]
<NI>5) {%Kuja (Mars).%} Kuja is two lakhs of yojanas above
<>Budha, and remains in every ra1s4i (house) more or less
<>for 45 days. When the position is affected it causes
<>inauspicious experiences to living beings. The chariot
<>of Kuja is made of gold, glittering and of huge size.
<>Eight horses born from Agni draw the chariot.
<NI>6) {%Br2haspati (Jupiter).%} Jupiter travels 2 lakhs of yojanas
<>away from Kuja's sphere. Though it is an auspicious
<>planet its reverse course is productive of evil results.
<>Jupiter travels for twelve months in every ra1s4i (house).
<>His golden chariot is drawn by eight white horses. (See
<>Br2haspati).
<NI>7) {%S4ani (Saturn).%} S4ani is 2 lakhs of yojanas away from
<>Jupiter's sphere, and it stays in every house for twenty
<>months. As it moves only slowly it is called S4anais4cara
<>also. S4ani is considered to be the son of Su1rya. It is an
<>inauspicious planet. His chariot is drawn by multi-
<>coloured horses born in the sky.
<NI>8) {%Ra1hu.%} His ash-coloured chariot is drawn by eight
<>horses as dark as beetles. Once the horses are harness-
<>ed to the chariot it will always be running. On full
<>moon days Ra1hu starts from Su1rya and reaches Candra
<>and returns to Su1rya on new moon days. It is an inaus-
<>picious planet. (For details see under Ra1hu).
<NI>9) {%Ketu.%} His chariot is drawn by eight horses, which
<>have the speed of wind. It is also an inauspicious
<>planet.
<NI>10) {%Saptars2is.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<>zone of S4ani exists the Saptars2i zone. Seven mahars2is
<>are incessantly on the move in that sphere, wishing all
<>that is well for the whole world. (See Saptars2is).
<NI>11) {%Dhruva.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<>saptars2iman2d2ala there is a place called Vis2n2upada.
<>Dhruva, son of Utta1napa1da lives there in the company
<>of Indra, Agni, Kas4yapa, Dharma and others. The
<>Dhruvaman2d2ala remains there stationary like the
<>supporting pillar of all the planets ever on the move.
<>(See Dhruva; Devi1bha1gavata 8th Skandha; Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part II).
<NI>Astrologers aver that living beings pass through the
<>periods and positions of the following planets, viz. Ketu,
<>S4ukra (Venus) A1ditya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Kuja
<>(Mars), Ra1hu, Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani (Saturn) and
<>Budha (Mercury). The following table shows how
<>people born under different stars pass through the
<>different das4a1s. The order of succession of the das4a1s
<>and the period of each das4a1 can also be seen from this
<>table.
<NI>Stars (Day of birth)
<F>1. To find out your das4a1 at the time of birth, please see the above table. Any one born under any of the stars is considered born
<>in the das4a1 shown in the right hand side against that star; e. g. People born under (As4vayuk) As4vini1, Mr2gas4i1r2s2a and Mu1la are born
<>into the Ketu das4a1. So with the other stars also as shown in the above table. To calculate how long the das4a1 into which a particular person
<>is born will last requires some astrological skill; also the exact time of birth should be known. A star remains dominant for about 24
<>hours. If a man is born under a star when half this period of dominance is over, then that man will get only half the period of the corres-
<>ponding das4a1. The portion of the das4a1 that the man will get is proportionate to the period of dominance of the star. For example,
<>a man is born under the star As4vaini1 (As4vyuk) when the star is in the last quarter of the Ketu das4a1. The total period of this das4a1 is
<>7 years. But the man will get only the last quarter of it, namely about 1(3/4) years. After that he will pass on to the next das4a1--S4ukra-

<HI>GRAHAPI1D2A1. (Adverse planetary effects on children)
<>Astrologers hold the view that planets affect or exercise
<>some influence on the lives of people. According to
<>that given hereunder is a brief description of planets,
<>which affect a child from its very birth as also of
<>remedial measures to keep the child free from such
<>adverse planetary effects.
<NI>On the very day of the birth of the child a female
<>planet called Pa1pini1 affects it as a result of which it will
<>refuse all food and be lying turning its head this way
<>and that. Pa1pini1 will tap the health not only of the
<>child but of the mother also. Bali (sacrificial offering
<>with flesh, fish and liquor as also waving with flowers and
<>fragrant materials and lighted lamp, and smearing the
<>child's body with sandal paste, mancetti powder, ta1tiri
<>flower, bark of pachotti, are remedies against the attack

<>female planet called Bhi1s2an2i1 attacks it. Symptoms of
<>the attack are coughing, deep breath and shrinking of
<>bodily organs. The remedies for the attack are: smearing
<>of the body with paste made in sheep's urine of tippali1
<>(long pepper), ra1macca, root of “Kat2ala1t2i” and sandal-

<HI>GRA1MADEVATA1. India is predominantly a rural
<>country with a number of villages, and the rural folk
<>depend mainly upon agriculture for living. Agricultural
<>land, rain and epidemics which affect them as well as
<>their cattle--these are the main concern of the villagers.
<>Indians, from very ancient days, used to believe that
<>each of the above has its own presiding devata1s. Such
<>devata1s are the gra1madevata1s.
<NI>Devi1 is the chief gra1madevata1 of South India. Devi1 is
<>called Durga1 and Ka1li1 also. But, Devi1 is worshipped in
<>sixtyfour different forms or aspects. The gentle Devi1,
<>viz. in her gentle aspect or attitude has three forms,
<>Kanya1, Ka1ma1ks2i1, and Mu1ka1mbika1. In Kerala Devi1 is
<>called Bhagavati1 also. Valiyan3ga1d2i Bhagavati1 of
<>Calicut is Laks2mi1devi1. Ka1li1 temples in Karn2a1t2aka are
<>called ‘Kot2t2a1puram3 Laks2mi1 Ks2etras’. There are such [Page299-b+ 64]
<>temples in Andhra also. Most of them are Jokula1mbika1
<>temples. In Tamil Nadu there are gra1madevata1s called
<>Mariyamma, Ka1li1yamma, and Draupadi1yamma. Not
<>the Draupadi1 mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata; but the
<>Kan2n2aki1 of Cilappadika1ra is the Devi1 worshipped in
<>Tamil Nadu.
<NI>There are two kinds of Devi1s called Saptama1tr2s and
<>Saptakanya1s. Saptama1tr2s have purus2as (husbands) and
<>saptakanya1s have seven brothers for help and support.
<>Devi1 pu1ja1 is very much prevalent in South India. The
<>custom is supposed to be as old as 5000 B.C. Idols of
<>Devi1 have been unearthed from Mohanjo-daro and
<>Harappa. Even the Buddhists worship the Devi1s called
<>Yaks2i1 and Ha1ri1ti1. When in after years Hinduism was
<>revitalised these gra1madevata1s got promoted as the
<>great Devata1s of the epics and the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ra1ma1yan2a mentions the incident of the Devi1 called
<>Lan3ka1laks2mi1 driving away Hanu1ma1n. There are famous
<>Ka1li1 temples in Ujjayini1 and Calcutta. It is believed
<>that in the temple at Cidambaram also Ka1li1 occupied
<>a prominent place. But, according to legends, S4iva
<>defeated Ka1li1 in a dance competition and ousted her to
<>her present temple at the outskirts of the city. Ca1mun2d2i1
<>is worshipped as the ancestral guardian deity in Mysore.
<>The Ka1ma1ks2i1 temple of Ka1n5ci1, Mi1na1ks2i1 temple of
<>Madura and Mu1ka1mbika1 temple of North Karn2a1t2aka
<>may be cited as examples for the worship of the gentle
<>form of Devi1. Alarmel Man3katta1ya1r temple at
<>Tirucca1nu1r is a very important Devi1 temple. The
<>‘Aditi’ in the Vedas and Kot2t2ravai of Tamil San3gha
<>texts point to the very long past of the Devi1 in India.
<>Ka1lida1sa and Ka1lamegha (a Tamil poet of the
<>fifteenth century have worshipped Ka1li1. S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa and the great modern Tamil poet
<>Bha1rati1 were devotees of Ka1li1.
<NI>There are also gra1madevas worshipped like the gra1ma-
<>devata1s. Muni1s4vara and Karuppan are two prominent
<>gra1madevas. In certain villages Bhairava, Vi1ra Irula,
<>Ka1t2t2eri and Non3gi are worshipped as gra1madevas. In
<>South Karn2a1t2aka a set of Devas called Bhu1tas are
<>worshipped, Pan5curuli being one of them. S4a1sta1 or
<>Ayyappa is another gra1madeva. S4a1sta1 is most popular
<>in Kerala and in Tamil Na1d2u. Buddha also is called
<>S4a1sta1. In certain places idols of S4a1sta1 with two wives,
<>called Pu1rn2a1 and Pus2kala1 are also found. S4abarimala
<>S4a1sta1 is yogamu1rti (in yogic pose).
<NI>In most of the gra1madeva temples idols of the Devas
<>are not found. A pi1t2ha (stool-like seat) is supoosed as
<>the seat of the Deva and it represents the Deva also.
<>But, in some temples weapons like the sword, the club
<>etc. are found. Offerings to the deity in gra1maks2etras
<>and annual festivals are common in such temples. (Na1m
<>van2amgum3 daivam3gal-Tamil).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1. A bhu1tagan2a (set of attendants) of S4iva.
<>Sins of those who worship this gan2a will be removed.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 25).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1YA. One born in the family of the Ks2atriya,
<>who is the governor of village. Nakula defeated the
<>gra1man2i1yas during the conquest of lands in connection
<>with the as4vamedha of Dharmaputra. (Sabha1 Parva;
<>Chapter 32, Verse 9).
<HI>GRANTHIKA. Name assumed by Nakula during his

<>tain. (S4loka 82, Chapter 49, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRAPATRA. A soldier of Skandadeva, (S4loka
<>74, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRAVAT2A. A mount of the Hima1layas. This
<>mount is the abode of Maha1deva. Those brahmins who
<>visit this place would get moks2a and those of other
<>castes would be absolved of all sins. (S4loka 91, Chapter
<>84, Vana Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRIKA1. A bird. Kas4yapa begot of his wife
<>Ta1mra1, the six birds namely Ka1ki1, S4yeni1, Bha1si1,
<>Gr2ddhrika1, S4uci and Gri1va1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter

<HI>GREEK LITERATURE. Greek is one of the most
<>important Indo-European languages. As an indepen-
<>dent branch of the original Indo-European language
<>Greek established itself by about 2000 B.C. Even
<>during its earliest period Greek had four local dialects
<>as a result of the arrival of the Greek-speaking people
<>at different periods of time. Iolic, Ionic-Attic, Arcado
<>Cyprean and western Greek are the four dialects.
<>Iolese was prevalent in the Lesbos region, and this is
<>the dialect mainly used in the poetry of Homer. The
<>Ionic and Attic dialects were prevalent in Ionia and
<>Attica respectively. After Homer, the major portion of
<>Greek literature was written in this dialect. The
<>Arcado-Cyprean dialect was used in Arcadio and
<>Cyprus. The fourth dialect was also called Doric.
<NI>Naval traditions, commerce and political power con-
<>tributed to the growth and development of Greek
<>language and literature. In each dialect, even from the
<>very beginning, literary efforts were made. Each of the
<>four spoken languages very soon developed into a
<>written language. But, in the very initial periods each
<>of the spoken dialects continued its existence in the
<>form of ballads and songs transferred from one man to
<>another. It was Homer who gave those popular ballads
<>an epic form and status and sowed the seeds of the
<>great literature of Greece.
<NI>The golden period of Greek literature was when the
<>city of Athens enjoyed supreme political power.
<>Literature during the period set the model for future
<>generations. It was during this period that Greek
<>achieved the best in different literary forms like tragedy,
<>comedy, lyric, elegy, history, philosophy, oratory etc.
<>Pindar, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Sophocles-Euripides,
<>Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and Demosthenes--
<>these are distinguished names who were responsible for
<>the great development of the literary forms referred to
<>above.
<NI>Greek literature passed the Alexandrian, Roman and
<>Byzantian periods before it arrived at the modern
<>period. It was Solomos and Valoritus and others who
<>gave impetus and inspiration to modern Greek litera-
<>ture.
<NI>GR2HADEVI1. Another name of the demoness Jara1.
<>(See under Jara1).
<HI>GR2HAPATI. A sage. There is a story in S4iva Pura1n2a
<>about this sage.
<NI>Vis4va1nara father of Gr2hapati was living with his wife
<>S4ucis2mati1 in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<>Narmada1. They had no children and S4ucis2mati1, was
<>grieved much on this account. She requested her husband
<>find out ways and means to get a child. Vis4va1nara, [Page300-b+ 64]
<>went to Ka1s4i1 and did penance to propitiate Vis4ves4vara
<>and the God appeared before him and blessed him and
<>said: “You will soon get a son”. Very soon the wife
<>of Vis4va1nara delivered a child and the son was named
<>Gr2hapati. When the child was nine years old Na1rada
<>came there once and warned them against fire. Vis4va1-
<>nara immediately went and did penance to propitiate
<>S4iva and obtained from him for his son the qualities of
<>fire also so that fire would be unable to act on him. It
<>was on account of this that Gr2hapati when he installed
<>an idol of S4iva at Ka1s4i1 gave it the name of Agni1s4vara.
<HI>GR2HASTHA. In ancient India the life of a male person
<>was divided into four stages, namely, Brahmacarya
<>Ga1rhasthya, Va1naprastha and Sannya1sa. He who is in
<>the second stage of life is called a Gr2hastha.
<NI>When a person marries, he becomes a Gr2hastha. The
<>bride should have certain qualities to be an ideal wife.
<>The girl should be only a third of the age of the male.
<>She should not have hair either too much or too little.
<>She should not be black or of a pin3gala hue. She
<>should not have any of her organs extra at the time of
<>birth. The following types of girls are to be avoided
<>for marriage. (1) Girls bred up by low-caste people
<>(2) girls with hair over the body (3) not born of a
<>good family (4) sick ones (5) ill-natured ones (6) girls
<>who use abusive language (7) with hereditary diseases
<>(8) with s4mas4ru (hair on the face) (9) girls with mascu-
<>line features (10) with the sound of males (11) lean
<>ones (12) with the voice of a crow (13) with thick eye-
<>lashes (14) round eyes. Again avoid girls having hair
<>on their legs, raised heels and those with small depre-
<>ssions on their cheeks when they laugh. Girls whose
<>bodies are too bright, with white nails, red eyes and
<>fat hands and legs are not good for marriage. Girls too
<>tall or too short, with eyelashes touching each other,
<>with broad and raised teeth are to be avoided. A true
<>Gr2hastha is one who marries a girl who is separated
<>from him by five generations on the maternal side and
<>seven generations on the paternal side.
<NI>A true Gr2hastha should daily worship devas, cows,
<>brahmins, scholars, old men and preceptors. He should
<>worship sandhya1 (dawn and dusk) daily and also fire.
<>He should wear on his body leaves of Vis2n2ukra1nti,
<>Karuka (couch grass), Tulasi1 (holy basil plant). He
<>should appear neat and smart wearing good dress, with
<>white flowers on his well combed head. He should
<>never steal, speak unpleasant words to anybody nor
<>speak an untruth even if it be pleasant. He should not
<>openly speak about the sins of others. He should not
<>covet another man's wife. He should not travel in a
<>damaged vehicle nor should he sit under the shade of
<>a tree on the banks of a river. A Gr2hastha should not
<>mingle with such persons as (1) men hated by the
<>people (2) outcastes from society (3) insane men (4)
<>those having a great number of enemies (5) those who
<>torment others (6) prostitutes (7) husbands of prosti-
<>tutes (8) those who use abusive language (9) those
<>who tell lies (10) spendthrifts (11) scandalmongers and
<>(12) rogues. Never travel alone. He should not bathe
<>against the flow in a river. Never enter a house on fire
<>nor climb to the extreme top of trees. He should not
<>grind his teeth, squeeze out his nose, yawn without
<>covering the mouth. breathe or spit, with the face
<>covered, laugh noisily, breathe out with a sound, bite [Page301-a+ 63]
<>the teeth, pinch grasses or write or draw on the ground
<>(Am3s4a 3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>GRI1VA1. A daughter in bird form born to Kas4yapapraja1-
<>pati by his wife Ta1mra1. Gri1va1 had the following
<>sisters, Ka1ki1, S4yeni1, Bha1si1, Gr2ddhrika1 and S4uci, all birds.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 1).
<HI>GR2TSAMADA I. A celebrated sage. He was the son of
<>a sage called Vi1tahavya. Gr2tsamada was equal to Br2has-
<>pati and a great friend of Indra. Once this sage lec-
<>tured to Yudhis2t2hira on the glory of S4iva. Many have
<>mistaken Grtsamada for Indra. Once the asuras bound
<>him by ropes mistaking him for Indra. He had a son
<>named Kuceta1. (For more details see under Varis2t2ha1)
<>(Chapters 18 and 30, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>GR2TSAMADA II. A King of the Bha1rgava dynasty. He
<>was the son of King Suhotra. Gr2tsamada had two bro-
<>thers. Ka1s4ya and Kus4a, and a son, S4unaka. (9th
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>GR2TSAMADA III. The son born to Indra of Mukunda1.
<>There is the following story about him in Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Once when Rukma1n3gada was out from the palace,
<>Indra, in the guise of Rukma1n3gada, went to
<>Mukunda1, wife of Rukma1n3gada, and slept with
<>her who was at that time sexually hungry. She delivered
<>a child in due course. This boy was Gr2tsamada. He
<>grew into a great scholar. Nobody was able to defeat
<>him in any verbal duel. Once Gr2tsamada went to the
<>palace of the king of Magadha to attend a S4ra1ddha (an
<>offering to the manes) along with Vasis2t2ha and others.
<>Atri Mahars2i who was present there then spoke sligh-
<>tingly of Gr2tsamada's parentage and Gr2tsamada coming
<>home questioned his mother. The mother then told him
<>what had happened and Gr2tsamada getting angry at the
<>immoral act committed by his mother cursed her and
<>said “May you be a Kan2t2aka tree”. Mukunda1 also did
<>not leave her son free. She cursed him thus “You will
<>have a demon as your son”. But Gr2tsamada went and
<>did penance to propitiate Gan2apati and got Bra1hman2ya.
<HI>GR2TSAPATI. He was the son of Kapila, a King of the
<>Pu1ru dynasty. He had a brother called Kaus4ika. Gr2tsa-
<>pati had sons in all the four castes, namely, Bra1hman2a,
<>Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra. (Chapter 277, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GUD2A1KES4A. Another name of Arjuna. He got the
<>name because he conquered sleep. (S4loka 8, Chapter
<>138, A1di Parva).
<HI>GU1D2HASENA. A King of the country of Pus2kara1vati1.
<HI>GUHA. King of the country of Nis2a1das alias S4r2n3gi-
<>verapura, on the banks of the river Gan3ga1. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>when he went on exile to the forests went to the resi-
<>dence of Guha accompanied by Laks2man2a and Si1ta1.
<>Guha, a devotee of Ra1ma, received them with respect
<>offering them many kinds of fruits and roots to eat.
<>But S4ri1 Ra1ma said that it was not proper to accept
<>fruits and roots and so he drank only pure water from
<>him. But Guha was asked to feed his horse. At night
<>when Laks2man2a stood watch over Ra1ma and Si1ta1, Guha
<>volunteered to stand guard but Laks2man2a refused to
<>accept the offer. So Guha kept company with Laks2man2a
<>and both of them spent the night talking to each other.
<>In the morning as per Ra1ma's request Guha brought
<>a canoe and Guha himself took Ra1ma, Laks2man2a and [Page301-b+ 64]
<>Si1ta1 to the other side of the river. (Sarga 50, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1m2a1yan2a, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>Guha is seen next when Bharata comes to the forest in
<>search of Ra1ma. When Bharata returned from Kekaya
<>he went in search of S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a and came
<>to Guha in S4r2n3giverapura. Guha then gave Bharata all
<>available information regarding S4ri1 Ra1ma. Guha then
<>sent the Da1s4a army along with Bharata. (Sarga 84,
<>Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>Guha, chief of S4r2n3giverapura, spent the night with
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a under an Oka tree. (Chapter 6,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>GUHA(S). A tribe of people of ancient India. A1ndhras,
<>Pulindas, Cucukas, Guhas, S4abaras and Bhadras are
<>some of the tribes of the south. (S4loka 42, Chapter 207,
<>S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>GUHASENA. See under Devasmita1.
<HI>GUHYAKA. A Yaks2a. (A division of Yaks2as who were
<>prominent members of the court of Kubera). They were
<>present at the marriage of Draupadi1. (S4loka 7, Chapter
<>186, A1di Parva).
<NI>{%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) The palace of Kubera in the sky is borne by Guh-
<>yakas. (S4loka 3, Chapter 10, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) Bhi1masena slew many Guhyakas on the mountain
<>of Gandhama1dana. (S4loka 55, Chapter 11, S4alya
<>Parva).

<>rata battle went to the world of the Guhyakas. (S4loka
<>23, Chapter 4, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).
<HI>GULIKA. A hunter who was given moks2a by the sage
<>Uttan3ga. This hunter once made an attempt to steal
<>the gold plates on the roof of the Vis2n2u temple at the
<>palace of Sauvi1ra. Uttan3ga was present at the temple
<>then and, Gulika tried to kill the sage. The sage cursed
<>him and killed him. Taking pity on him later Uttan3ga
<>sprinkled some water from the river Gan3ga1, on him
<>and the hunter attained Vaikun2t2ha. (Na1radi1ya Pura1na).
<HI>GUN2A. See under Pattu (Ten).
<HI>GUN2A1D2HYA. He is the author of the celebrated Br2hat-
<>katha1 which is a precious mine of Sanskrit Literature.
<>Gun2a1d2hya had written this in satanic (pais4a1cika) lan-
<>guage difficult for ordinary people to read or understand.
<>This was translated into Sanskrit by the poet Ks2emen-
<>dra in a book called Br2hatkatha1man5jari1. This was the
<>first translation and it was in an abridged form. Soma-
<>deva made a more elaborate translation and it is this
<>translation that is now known as the Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Gun2a1d2hya is believed to be an incarnation of the S4iva-
<>pa1rs2ada, Ma1lyava1n. There is a story behind Ma1lyava1n
<>being cursed and made to be born as man by Pa1rvati1.
<>Once Pa1rvati1 worried S4iva to tell her a story original
<>and interesting and not heard of by anybody before.
<>Placing Nandikes4a at the door and instructing him not
<>to allow anybody inside S4iva started narrating the story
<>of the Vidya1dharas to Pa1rvati1. At that time Pus2padanta,
<>chief of the genie-guards of S4iva who was at liberty
<>to go to the presence of S4iva at any time, came there
<>and heedless of the protests of Nandikes4a entered the
<>room. There he found S4iva telling a story to Pa1rvati1
<>and she was hearing the same with rapt attention. The
<>story was so interesting that Pus2padanta also heard it
<>standing concealed in a place in the room. After having
<>heard the whole story Pus2padanta went back unnoticed [Page302-a+ 65]
<>and told the story to his wife, Jaya1. Jaya1 on another
<>occasion told the story to Pa1rvati1 and the latter was
<>taken aback and she went to S4iva and complained:
<>“Your Lordship told me that the story was unique,
<>not heard of before by anybody. But even Jaya1 knows
<>it.” And she wept with disappointment. Then S4iva
<>stood in meditation for sometime, and knew how
<>Pus2padanta had entered the room unnoticed and how
<>he had told the story he had heard to Jaya1. S4iva
<>explained this to Pa1rvati1 and she immediately sent
<>word for Pus2padanta who came trembling and confess-
<>ed everything. Pa1rvati1 then cursed Pus2padanta
<>and also Ma1lyava1n who came to speak on behalf of
<>Pus2padanta and made them men. They begged for
<>relief from the curse and then she said, “Long ago
<>Vais4ravan2a cursed a Yaks2a named Suprati1ka and con-
<>verted him into a devil named Ka1n2abhu1ti. This devil
<>is now living in the deep forests on the Vindhya moun-
<>tains. When you talk with him you will become your
<>old selves again. Pus2padanta should first tell the story
<>he has heard from S4iva to Ka1n2abhu1ti and then he will
<>be relieved from the curse. Ka1n2abhu1ti will then tell
<>Ma1lyava1n many stories. Then Ka1n2abhu1ti will get
<>release from the curse. Ma1lyava1n should make public
<>all the stories he had heard from Ka1n2abhu1ti and then
<>he will also get release from the curse.” Accordingly
<>Pus2padanta was born as Vararuci in the city of Kau-
<>s4a1m3bi1 and Ma1lyava1n as Gun2a1d2hya in the city of
<>Supratis2t2hita. (For details see under Vararuci).
<NI>The story of how Suprati1ka became Ka1n2abhu1ti is this:
<>The Yaks2a, Suprati1ka, got friendly with a demon
<>named S4u1las4iras and they moved about freely as chums.
<>Vais4ravan2a did not like this and he cursed Suprati1ka
<>and converted him into a satan. At once, Di1rghajan3gha,
<>elder brother of Suprati1ka, came and begged for relief.
<>Vais4ravan2a then said: “Pus2padanta will be born on
<>the earth by a curse as man and he will one day come
<>and tell Suprati1ka many great stories. After hearing
<>them he should narrate them to Ma1lyava1n who will
<>then be born on the earth as man. Suprati1ka will then
<>get release from the curse and become his old self again”.
<>Suprati1ka was born in the forests of Vindhya as
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti.
<NI>This is the story of the birth of Gun2a1d2hya. There is a
<>city called Supratis2t2hita in the country of Pratis2t2ha1na
<>and there lived a brahmin named Somas4arma1. He had
<>two sons, Vatsa and Gulmaka and a daughter named
<>S4ruta1rtha1. Before long the parents died and S4ruta1rtha1
<>grew up under the protection of her brothers. Ki1rtisena,
<>brother of Va1suki, married her by ga1ndharva rites and
<>Gun2a1d2hya was the child born to them.
<NI>Even while he was a boy he went to the south for his
<>education and there from a brahmin he studied all arts
<>and sciences. When he completed his studies he started
<>on a tour and at that time became the minister of a
<>king called Sa1tava1hana. He married from there. One
<>day his (Sa1tava1hana's) wife rebuked the king when the
<>latter made some linguistic errors and Sa1tava1hana be-
<>came dejected and moody from that day onwards. Then
<>there came to the court of the King a brahmin named
<>S4arvavarman who promised to make the King proficient
<>in languages within six months. But Gun2a1d2hya said that
<>it was not possible to do so within six months. They made
<>a bet. Gun2a1d2hya swore that if S4arvavarman would teach
<>the King the S4abdasa1stra (science of language-sounds) [Page302-b+ 65]
<>within six months he (Gun2a1d2hya) would abandon his
<>knowledge of Sanskrit, Prakrit and local language. On the
<>other hand if S4arvavarma1 failed to accomplish the feat
<>the latter should wear on his head for twelve years the
<>chappals of Gun2a1d2hya. S4arvavarman agreed and went
<>to do penance to please Subrahman2ya. Subrahman2ya
<>granted him a boon by the power of which S4arvavar-
<>man made Sa1tava1hana a scholar in Sanskrit. Defeated,
<>Gun2a1d2hya abandoned his knowledge of all languages
<>and bidding adieu to the King by gestures left for the
<>Vindhyan forests.
<NI>When Gun2a1d2hya went to the forests Ka1n2abhu1ti, King
<>of the Satans was not in his place. He heard the
<>satans speaking in their peculiar language and intelli-
<>gent that he was he picked up the language.
<>and when Ka1n2abhu1ti came he spoke to him in his own
<>language. Ka1n2abhu1ti told in the satanic language the
<>great stories of seven Vidya1dharas. Gun2a1d2hya took
<>seven years to write the stories in the satanic language
<>and compile them into seven lakhs of granthas to form
<>a Maha1ka1vya. There were no writing materials availa-
<>ble for him and Gun2a1d2hya wrote them all on leaves
<>using blood and twigs. When he started reading his
<>book all the devas assembled in the sky to hear it. On
<>hearing it Ka1n2abhu1ti got release from the curse. It is
<>this book containing seven lakhs of granthas that is
<>called the Br2hatkatha1.
<NI>Gun2a1d2hya then thought of how to keep alive such an
<>interesting and gigantic book and then two of his
<>companions Gun2adeva and Nandideva suggested to
<>him to dedicate the book to the King, Sa1tava1hana.
<>Gun2a1d2hya agreed to that and the two disciples took the
<>book to the King. The King read the whole story. But
<>did not like it. It was very elaborate. The language
<>was satanic. It was written with blood. The King
<>looked at the book with contempt.
<NI>When the disciples found that the King was not in
<>favour of the work, they took it back to Gun2a1dhya.
<>Gun2a1d2hya felt a great dejection. He went to a hillock
<>nearby with his disciples and made a big fire-pit. He set
<>aside the story of the Vidya1dhara named Narava1hana-
<>datta composed of a lakh of granthas for the use of
<>his disciples and then started putting into the fire-pit
<>the rest, reading aloud each leaf before he put it into
<>the fire. The sad disciples watched it weeping. Even
<>the wild animals of the forest flocked to the place and
<>stood there listening to Gun2a1d2hya. At that time Sa1ta-
<>va1hana became a sick man. The physicians of the
<>palace said that the illness was caused by the dry flesh
<>he was taking. The cook was called in and he accus-
<>ed the hunters who supplied them with flesh
<>daily. The hunters were questioned and they informed
<>the King that only such flesh was available since all
<>the beasts and birds were standing without food listen-
<>ing to a man who was reading something from a leaf
<>and then burning it in a fire-pit before him. Sa1tava1-
<>hana immediately went to the place guided by the
<>hunters. There to his astonishment he found Gun2a1d2hya
<>sitting before a fire-pit surrounded by weeping beasts
<>and birds and throwing leaves of his book one by one
<>into the fire after reading each before it was put into
<>the fire. Sa1tava1hana ran to him and prostrated before
<>him. Gun2a1d2hya then told Sa1tava1hana his story in
<>satanic language beginning from the curse on Pus2pa-
<>danta down to his destroying his own work in the fire. [Page303-a+ 63]
<>His disciples translated his talk to the King. The King
<>was awe-stricken3 and he asked for the granthas. But
<>by that time he had already burnt six lakhs of gran-
<>thas containing six stories. He gave to the King the
<>remaining one lakh of granthas. After that, bidding
<>farewell to the King, Gun2a1d2hya jumped into the fire
<>and abandoned his life on earth and went to the
<>presence of S4iva.
<NI>King Sa1tava1hana accompanied by the disciples of
<>Gun3a1d2hya came to his palace carrying the ‘Br2hatkatha1’
<>containing the story of Narava1hanadatta. He gave
<>presents to Gun2adeva and Nandideva who explained
<>to him the book in Sanskrit. King Sa1tava1hana added
<>a preface to the book to explain to the public how the
<>book came to be written in satanic language. The book
<>very soon got world fame. (Pi1t2ha1nulam3baka Katha1-
<>sarit sa1gara).
<HI>GUN2AKES4I1. Daughter of Ma1tali, charioteer of Indra.
<>She was more beautiful and well-behaved than many
<>other girls. Ma1tali went about in search of a suitable
<>husband for her in all the three worlds. At last he
<>met Na1rada going to the presence of Kubera. He told
<>Na1rada about this and Na1rada took Ma1tali to Pa1ta1laloka
<>to search for a suitable bridegroom. Then they found out
<>a serpent boy named Sumukha (good looking) worthy
<>of his name who was the grandson of A1ryaka and son
<>of Cikura born of the family of Aira1vata. But Sumu-
<>kha was in danger at that time. Garud2a had taken a
<>vow that he would eat Sumukha the next month. A1ryaka
<>told Na1rada about this. Na1rada took Sumukha to the
<>court of Indra. Maha1vis2n2u was also present there. When
<>Na1rada told the story there Indra blessed Sumukha and
<>granted him long life. This made Garud2a angry and he
<>went to the court of Indra and rebuked Indra. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u who was present there then did not like this act of
<>Garud2a and he called the latter to his side and asked
<>him whether he could bear the weight of one of his
<>arms. With arrogance Garud2a said ‘yes’ and Vis2n2u
<>then placed one of his arms on the shoulder of Garud2a
<>But Garud2a found the weight unbearable and begged
<>pardon of Vis2n2u, bereft of all his arrogance. The
<>marriage of Sumukha with Gun2akes4i1 was then conduct-
<>ed. (Chapters 97 to 105. Udyoga Parva.)
<NI>GUN2AMUKHYA1. A celestial maiden who took part
<>in the birthday celebrations of Arjuna. She gave a
<>dance there then. (S4loka 61, Chapter 122, A1di Parva).
<HI>GUN2ANIDHI. A Pura1n2ic character who lived a sinful
<>life and yet attained Svarga. In the country of Kosala
<>there was once a noble brahmin named Girina1tha who
<>was rich, erudite and well-versed in the Vedas. Con-
<>sidering his greatness people called him Girina1thadi1k-
<>s2ita. Gun2anidhi was his son.
<NI>When Gun2anidhi grew up he started his education
<>under a preceptor called Sudhis2n2a. Sudhis2n2a had a
<>wife named Mukta1vali1. After some time Gun2anidhi
<>started having clandestine relations with Mukta1vali1.
<>This developed so much that Gun2anidhi gave poison
<>to his guru and killed him. His parents came to know
<>of this and they came and reprimanded him. Evil-
<>natured Gun2anidhi thought that the presence of his
<>parents would be an annoyance to him in future. So
<>Gun2anidhi and Mukta1vali1 planned together to kill his
<>parents and one day they poisoned them. [Page303-b+ 64]
<NI>After some time Gun2anidhi and his wife lost all they
<>had and gradually Gun2anidhi turned himself into a
<>thief and drunkard. Nobody in the village liked the
<>couple and all the villagers combined together and
<>sent the couple away from the place. Gun2anidhi and
<>Mukta1vali1 went to the forests and there they started a
<>life of looting the travellers. After some years of a
<>sinful life Gun2anidhi one day died lying beneath a
<>Rudra1ks2a tree. Servants of both Yama and S4iva came to
<>claim the soul of Gun2anidhi. The servants of Yama said
<>that the right place of Gun2anidhi the sinner, was in hell
<>but the servants of S4iva said that even if he was a great
<>sinner his place was in heaven because he died lying
<>beneath a Rudra1ks2a tree. In the end the S4ivadu1tas won
<>and took Gun2anidhi to heaven.
<NI>This story was once told by S4iva himself to demonstrate
<>the glory of Rudra1ks2a. (Skandha 11, Devi1 Bha1gavata)
<HI>GUN2AS4ARMAN. A character of the Pura1n2as well versed
<>in all arts and sciences. He was the son of the brahmin
<>A1dityas4arman of Ujjayini1. The birth of Gun2as4arman
<>bears a story. Once A1dityas4arman went to the forests and
<>by his spiritual powers made Sulocana1, a celestial
<>nymph, to merge with him. A son was born to them
<>and he was named Gun2as4arman. A1dityas4arman
<>became a deva. Even from boyhood he became very
<>erudite. Once Indra came to see A1dityas4arman. A1ditya-
<>s4arman who was in deep thoughts did not see Indra
<>and so did not rise up when Indra came. Indra felt
<>insulted and cursed him to be born again on Earth.
<>A1dityas4arman prostrated before Indra and asked for
<>pardon. Indra then said that it would be enough if
<>his son was born on Earth in his stead. So Gun2as4arman
<>was born on Earth to bear the curse of his father.
<NI>At that time Ujjayini1 was being ruled over by a King
<>called Maha1sena. He had a very beautiful wife named
<>As4okavati1. Gun2as4arman became gradually an intimate
<>friend of the King. Knowing that Gun2as4arman was
<>well versed in all arts the King and queen asked him
<>to give them a performance in dancing. The dance
<>was so excellent that the King engaged Gun2as4arman to
<>teach dancing to As4okavati1.
<NI>Once a royal attendant tried to give poisoned food to
<>the King and Gun2as4arman finding it out saved the
<>King. From that day onwards the King loved him
<>more. When once Maha1sena was imprisoned by his
<>enemies Gun2as4arman by his magic powers released
<>him. In return for this help the King gave Gun2as4ar-
<>man a thousand villages.
<NI>Then to the misfortune of all As4okavati1 fell in love
<>with Gun2as4arman. Gun2as4arman bluntly refused her
<>love. Embittered at this As4okavati1 started talking ill of
<>Gun2as4arman and the King at last sent Gun2as4arman out
<>from the palace. The servants of the King tried to
<>capture him and put him into prison but Gun2as4arman
<>escaped from the royal servants by his magic powers.
<NI>He then went and stayed in the house of a brahmin
<>named Agnidatta1 and married his daughter, Sundari.
<>Then on the advice of the brahmin Gun2as4raman did
<>penance to propitiate Subrahman2ya and got many
<>more powers from him. Gunas4arman equipped with
<>these additional powers conquered Maha1sena and his
<>country and became King there. He then sent Maha1sena
<>and his wife As4okavati1, out from the country. (Su1rya-
<>prabha1lam3baka, Taran3ga 6, Katha1saritsa1gara). [Page304-a+ 63]
<HI>GUN2AVARA1. A heroine, devoted to her husband, in
<>the ancient literature of India. There is a story in
<>Katha1saritsa1gara describing the depth of her devotion
<>to her husband.
<NI>Gun2avara1 was the queen of Vi1rabhuja, King of the
<>country of Vardhama1na. He had besides Gun2avara1
<>ninetynine other wives. But none had any children. So,
<>the King asked the chief physician of the state to
<>suggest a way to remedy this. The physician asked for
<>a white and horned goat to be brought and he then
<>made with its flesh a preparation. Then sprinkling
<>over it a special medicinal dust, he gave it to the wives
<>to eat. But Gun2avara1 who never left her husband for
<>a moment came late to take the preparation and by the
<>time she came the others had already consumed the whole
<>lot. Then by an order of the King the horns of the
<>goat were made into a similar preparation and
<>Gun2avara1 took it with the dust sprinkled over it. All
<>the wives got a child each. Gun2avara1's son was named
<>S4r2n3gabhuja.
<NI>All the other wives of Vi1rabhuja became jealous of
<>Gun2avara1. They told the King that Gun2avara1 was in
<>love with a servant of the palace. The King did not
<>believe it. But he thought he would test her. The King
<>called the servant in question and accusing him of
<>having committed the murder of a brahmin sent him
<>away from the state on a pilgrimage. Sorrow-stricken
<>the servant set out for the pilgrimage. The King then
<>approached Gun2avara1 and said that a sannya1sin had
<>declared that he, the King, would lose his crown if one
<>of his wives was not put in a cell underground.
<>Gun2avara1 who adored her husband readily agreed to
<>live underground.
<NI>The other wives were satisfied and yet they wanted to
<>send away her son, S4r2n3gabhuja also from the palace.
<>One day when all the children were playing in the
<>court-yard a stork came and sat perched on the top of
<>the palace. The princes attempted to catch hold of it.
<>A sannya1sin who came there then informed the children
<>that the stork was none other than Agnis4ikha, a demon,
<>who had come there to capture and take away the
<>children. All the children then tried to drop it down
<>by arrows. But none succeeded. Then S4r2n3gabhuja took
<>a golden arrow from the palace and sent it against the
<>bird. The arrow struck the demon but the bird flew
<>away carrying the golden arrow.
<NI>The other princes found it as an opportunity to rebuke
<>S4r2n3gabhuja and they, led by Nirva1sabhuja, reproached
<>him for losing the golden arrow. Unable to bear their
<>insult S4r2n3gabhuja went after the stork following the
<>path of the blood drops which fell on the ground from
<>the wound. At last he reached Dhu1mapura, the land of
<>Agnis4ikha. There he fell in love with Ru1pas4ikha1, the
<>daughter of Agnis4ikha. They were soon married and
<>yet Agnis4ikha gave S4r2n3gabhuja great trouble. At last
<>S4r2n3gabhuja and Ru1pas4ikha1 took the golden arrow and
<>eloped from the place one night and reached the city of
<>Vardhama1na. Agnis4ikha followed them but the magic
<>powers of Ru1pas4ikha1 made him turn back. When King
<>Vi1rabhuja saw his son S4r2n3gabhuja he was extremely
<>happy. The King then released Gun2avara1 from the
<>dungeon and praised her for her devotion to her hus-
<>band. He loved her more and treated her with greater [Page304-b+ 63]
<>affection than before. At that time the servant who had
<>been sent away also returned. (Taran3ga 5, Ratnapra-
<>bha1lam3baka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>GUN2A1VARA1. A celestial lady. This lady was present

<HI>GUN2AVATI1 II. Daughter born to Suna1bha, younger
<>brother of Vajrana1bha. She had an elder sister named
<>Candramati1. Prabha1vati1, daughter of Vajrana1bha, was
<>married to Pradyumna, son of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. One day
<>when Prabha1vati1 and Pradyumna were engaged in
<>amorous conversation Gun2avati1 and Candramati1 came
<>to them and they expressed a desire to get husbands
<>for themselves from among the Ya1davas. Prabha1vati1
<>advised Candramati1 to marry Gada, brother of Kr2s2n2a
<>and Gun2avati1 to marry Sa1m3ba, son of Kr2s2n2a. (Chap-
<>ter 94. Harivam3s4a).
<HI>GUN2A1VATI1. A river. Once Paras4ura1ma slew some
<>Ks2atriyas on the northern banks of this river. (S4loka
<>8, Chapter 70, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>GUPTA. A caste appellation. In ancient India appe-
<>llations to the names were put to distinguish one caste
<>from another. So ‘S4arma1’ was added to a brahmin name,
<>‘Varma1’ to a Ks2atriya name ‘Gupta’ to a Vais2ya
<>name and ‘Da1sa’ to a S4u1dra name. Such appellations
<>were considered to be a mark of nobility in those olden

<HI>GURUDA1RA. A son of Garud2a. (S4loka 13, Chapter
<>101, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>GURUPARAMPARA1. The origin of the Vedas and the
<>lineage of Gurus is given below:
<NI>1) {%Origin of the Vedas.%} At the time of creation the
<>Veda was born from the face of God. It contained a
<>lakh of granthas with four pa1das like R2k. From the
<>Veda were born the ten yajn5as. The Veda was origi-
<>nally one. It was Vya1sa who divided it into four divi-
<>sions resulting in the four Vedas.
<NI>Vya1sa divided the Vedas thus: When Brahma1 command-
<>ed Vya1sa to divide the Vedas into divisions he first
<>selected four disciples who could see the end of the
<>Vedas. He accepted Paila to study R2gveda, Vais4am3-
<>pa1yana to study Yajurveda, Jaimini to study Sa1maveda
<>and Sumantu to study Atharvaveda. Besides these he
<>selected the highly intelligent Romahars2an2a alias Su1ta
<>to study the Itiha1sas and Pura1n2as.
<NI>At first, the Veda was one. Vya1sa divided it into four.
<>He based the division on the ca1turhotra, performance of [Page305-a+ 64]
<>four hotr2s. He arranged the performance of Adhvaryu
<>as Yajus, that of hotr2 as R2ks, that of Udga1tr2 as Sa1mans
<>and that of Brahma1 as Atharvans. Then he separated
<>the R2ks to form R2gveda, Yajus to form Yajurveda and
<>Sa1mans to form Sa1maveda. He devoted Atharvaveda to
<>specify the rites and duties of Kings and the deeds of
<>Brahma1. Vedavya1sa thus split the single Veda tree into
<>four and from there arose later a forest of Veda trees.
<NI>2) {%The saints of R2gveda.%} Paila divided R2gveda into
<>two sam3hita1s and gave one each to Indrapramati and
<>Ba1s2kala. Sage Ba1s2kala divided his Sam3hita1 again into
<>four and taught it to four of his disciples, Bodhi, A1dima1-
<>d2hava, Ya1jn5avalkya and Para1s4ara. Indrapramati with-
<>out splitting his sam3hita1 taught it to his renowned son,
<>Ma1n2d2u1keya. The branch of Indrapramati thus went
<>down into circulation through the disciples of Ma1n2-
<>d2u1keya and the disciples of the disciples and so on.
<>Vedamitra of S4a1kalya gotra, one sage in the line of the
<>disciples of Ma1n2d2u1keya, split the sam3hita1 into five, and
<>taught it to Mudgala, Gomukha, Va1tsya, S4a1li1ya and
<>S4ari1ra. S4a1kapu1rn2a a colleague of Vedamitra divided it
<>into three and added a division to it by composing a
<>Nirukta of his own. He taught them to Vaita1lika,
<>Bala1ka and Kraun5ca. This was how the Indrapramati
<>Sam3hita1 produced branches and sub-branches. Ba1s2kala
<>divided his sam3hita1 into another set of three and taught
<>it to Ka1la1yani, Ga1rgya, and Katha1java. The sages
<>mentioned above are the ones who spread R2gveda in
<>the world.
<NI>3) {%Saints of Yajurveda.%} Vais4ampa1yana, disciple of Veda
<>Vya1sa, made twentyseven divisions of Yajurveda and
<>taught them to his disciples. Among those disciples was
<>Ya1jn5avalkya, son of Brahmara1ta. The branch Taittiri1ya
<>originated from Ya1jn5avalkya.
<NI>4) {%The Taittiri1ya branch.%} Once all the sages learned in
<>the Vedas made a decision. He who does not attend the
<>Brahmasama1ja meeting held at the mountain of Maha1-
<>meru will be tainted with the sin of Brahmahatya1
<>(murder of a brahmin). At one time Vais4ampa1yana
<>was not able to attend and so was charged with the sin
<>of Brahmahatya1. He called his disciples to his side and
<>told them that they should observe a Vrata to absolve
<>Vais4ampa1yana of his sin. Then one of his disciples,
<>Ya1jn5avalkya, stood up and said that he would observe
<>the vrata alone and that there was no need of anybody
<>else in that matter. When asked why he said so he
<>replied that none of the colleagues of his was so bril-
<>liant and majestic as he was. Vais4ampa1yana did not
<>like this arrogance of Ya1jn5avalkya and so angrily
<>commanded Ya1jn5avalkya to give back all that had been
<>taught to him by Vais4ampa1yana. Obeying orders Ya1jn5a-
<>valkya vomited all the yajus and went away from the
<>place. The other sages taking the form of the bird,
<>Tittiri, accepted the vomited yajus. Therefore that
<>branch of the Veda got the name of Taittiri1ya and
<>those sages were known as the Taittiri1yas.
<NI>5) {%Aya1taya1ma(s).%} On his leaving Vais4ampa1yana
<>Ya1jn5avalkya put into operation a new set of Yajus
<>called Aya1taya1ma unknown even to Vais4ampa1yana.
<>This was how it happened. Ya1jn5avalkya after leaving
<>the Brahmasama1ja went and did penance to propitiate
<>the Sun-god. The Sun appeared before him in the form
<>of a horse. Ya1jn5avalkya then requested him to grant
<>him new yajus unknown even to Vais4ampa1yana. [Page305-b+ 63]
<>The Sun then remaining in the shape of the horse
<>(Va1ji) itself imparted to him instructions on a new
<>set of Yajus called Aya1taya1ma which were not known
<>to anybody else, even to Vais4ampa1yana. Those who
<>studied it were called Va1jis. There are fifteen branches
<>of the Va1jis, Ka1nnu being one of them. All were put
<>into operation by Ya1jn5avalkya.
<NI>6) {%The Sannya1sins of Sa1maveda.%} Vedavya1sa taught Sa1ma-
<>veda to Jaimini. Jaimini had a son, Sumantu, and he in
<>turn had a son named Sutva. Sumantu and Sutva
<>were very intelligent and they studied one branch each
<>of the Vedas. Sutva had a son, Sukarma1, and he
<>divided Sa1mavedasam3hita1 into a thousand branches.
<>Sukarma1 had two disciples: Hiran2yana1bha and Paus2-
<>pin5ji, and both of them studied all the thousand
<>divisions of the Sa1maveda. The five hundred disciples
<>of Hiran2yana1bha who came from the north and studied
<>Sa1maveda were called Udi1cya Sa1magas (those come from
<>the north). Another five hundred came from the east
<>and studied Sa1mavedasam3hita1 from Hiran2yana1bha and
<>they were called Pra1cya sa1magas. (Hiran2yana1bha is
<>known as Kaus4alya also.) Paus2pin5ji had four disciples:
<>Loga1ks2i, Kauthumi, Kaks2i1va1n and La1n3gali. These four
<>and their disciples split their sam3hita1s and increased
<>them. Kr2ti, one of the disciples of Hiran2yana1bha,
<>taught his disciples twentyfour sam3hita1s. They also
<>split them into many more and made the Sa1maveda
<>bigger.
<NI>7) {%The saints of Atharvaveda.%} Vya1sa taught Atharvaveda
<>to Sumantu. Sage Sumantu taught it to his disciple
<>Kabandha first. Kabandha split it into two and gave
<>one each to his disciples: Deva1dars4a and Pathya. Deva
<>had four disci1ples: Medha1 Brahmabali, S4a1ntaka1yani and
<>Pippala1da. Pathya had three: Ja1ba1li, Kumuda and
<>S4aunaka. All these made sam3hita1s. S4aunaka split his
<>sam3hita1 into two and taught one to Badru and another
<>to Saindhava. Mun5jikes4a learnt it from Saindhava. He
<>split it into two first and then again into three. The five
<>s4am3hita1s of Mun5jikes4a namely, Naks2atrakalpa, Veda-
<>kalpa, Sam3hita1kalpa, A1n3girasakalpa and S4a1ntikalpa are
<>the most important divisions of the Atharvaveda. The
<>Naks2atrakalpa contains methods of worshipping Nak-
<>s2atras; the Vedakalpa contains the rites of the R2tvik
<>Brahma1, and the Sam3hita1kalpa contains the science of
<>the care of horses and elephants.
<NI>8) {%Pura1n2as.%} Vya1sa compiled a Pura1n2a sam3hita1 using
<>speeches, appendices, poems and Kalpanirn2ayas and tau-
<>ght it to Romahars2an2a alias Su1ta. Su1ta had six disciples
<>named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitra1yus, Sa1m3s4apa1yana,
<>Akr2tavran2a, and Sa1varn2i. Akr2tavran2a, Sa1varn2i and S4a1m3-
<>s4apa1yana born of Kas4yapagotra have themselves made
<>Pura1n2asam3hita1s. There is another sam3hita1 composed
<>by Romahars2an2a based on the sam3hi1ta1s made by the
<>above three.
<NI>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a is based on the latter four sam3hita1s. There
<>are eighteen Pura1n2as, namely, A1gneya, Bra1hma, Brahma1-
<>n2d2a, Brahmavaivarta, Bha1gavata, Bhavis2ya, Garud2a,
<>Ku1rma, Lin3ga, Ma1rkan2d2eya, Matsya, Na1radi1ya, Padma,
<>S4iva, Skanda, Va1mana, Vara1ha and Vis2n2u. There are
<>eighteen sub Pura1n2as also. In all these are described the
<>creation, the deluge, the dynasties of the devas, history
<>of kingly dynasties, changes of generations etc. (Am3s4a
<>3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a; 12th Skandha, Bha1gavata). [Page306-a+ 62]

<>S4iva) defeated them after a fierce fight lasting for a
<>thousand years. The Hariharas returned to their abodes
<>and spoke about their achievements. Their wives laugh-
<>ed at the bravado of their husbands. At this Maha1-
<>vis2n2u got angry with Laks2mi1 and S4iva with Pa1rvati1,

<>Pa1rvati1 to return to their husbands so that they might
<>regain their former power. Yet, Brahma1 told them that

<>release the horse Arjuna killed Sudhanva1 and Suratha,
<>sons of Ham3sadhvaja. Grieved and enraged at their
<>death Ham3sadhvaja took the field against Arjuna, and
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a finding that Arjuna's life was in danger
<>pacified them both. Also Kr2s2n2a requested Ham3sadhvaja
<>to be a supporter of Arjuna in future. Ham3sadhvaja

<>aspects of Devas. In the epics of no other country could
<>be found a character that belongs to the animal
<>kingdom who is as powerful, erudite and philosophic
<>as Hanu1ma1n.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Many and different are the stories about
<>the birth of Hanu1ma1n told in Pura1n2ic literature, and
<>they are briefly noted below.
<NI>(1) The semen discharged by S4iva, whose erotic
<>feelings were excited by the sight of Vis2n2u disguised
<>as Mohini1 was received by the Saptars2is and deposited
<>in the womb of An5jana1, and Hanu1ma1n was born out of
<>it. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atarudrasam3hita1).
<NI>(2) Das4aratha divided among his wives the divine
<>pa1yasa (pudding) got from the putraka1mes2t2i yajn5a
<>which was performed so that he might be blessed with
<>children. Somehow or other a kite snatched some
<>pudding and flew off with it. On its way the pudding
<>fell down from the beaks of the kite on the fingers of
<>An5jana1 doing tapas in the forest. She ate that pudding
<>and Hanu1ma1n was born as the son of An5jana1 due
<>to the extraordinary powers of the pudding. (A1nan-
<>da Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(3) S4iva, once in his fierce and effulgent form (aspect)
<>entered Kesari1, the husband of An5jana1 and had coitus [Page307-b+ 63]
<>with her. After that Va1yu (Wind-god) also had coitus
<>with her. Thus as a result of the sexual act by both
<>the Devas An5jana1 got pregnant. Later, An5jana1 was
<>about to throw into the valley of the mountain her
<>new-born child as it was an ugly one when Va1yu
<>(Wind god) intervened and saved the child. Hanu1ma1n
<>was the child thus born of S4iva and Va1yu. (Bhavis2ya
<>Pura1n2a, Pratisarga Parva).
<NI>(4) Hanu1m2a1n's actual father was S4iva. Gan2apati
<>was born to S4iva and Pa1rvati1 as they played in the
<>forest disguised as elephants. After that S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1 played about in the forest disguised as monkeys
<>as a result of which Pa1rvati1 got pregnant. Since
<>Pa1rvati1 did not like the idea of being the mother of a
<>monkey, S4iva, by his yogic power entrusted the child,
<>(in embryo) that was in the womb of Pa1rvati1 to
<>Va1yu (Wind god), who carried it with him hither and
<>thither till it became mature, when it was deposited in
<>An5jana1, the monkey woman. The monkey called Kesari1
<>was her husband. Thus Hanu1ma1n was born as the son
<>of An5jana1.
<NI>An5jana1 also has a story of her own. Once upon a time
<>she was the maid-servant called Pun5jikasthala1 of
<>Br2haspati. One day she went out to gather flowers
<>when the love-makings of other young women attracted
<>her so much that, without gathering flowers, and her
<>erotic sentiments being aroused much, she returned
<>home and covered Br2haspati with kisses. Br2haspati got
<>really angry with the misbehaviour of his maid-servant
<>and cursed her into a female monkey. She was told
<>that, after she had lived for sometime with a monkey-
<>husband she would get a child from the vitality of
<>S4iva, after which she would return to him as maid
<>servant as of old. And, accordingly, Pun5jikasthala1
<>became a female monkey under the name An5jana1 and
<>lived at An5jana1 forest with a handsome monkey called
<>Kesari1 as her husband.
<NI>It was while An5jana1 was doing tapas so that she might
<>become pregnant by S4iva that S4iva and Pa1rvati1 played
<>in that forest disguised as monkeys, and Pa1rvati1
<>conceived and the child ultimately came out as the son
<>of An5jana1.
<NI>Even while An5jana1 was pregnant the child in her womb
<>had much to suffer at the hands of Ba1li. Hearing from
<>Na1rada that S4iva's son had been born in An5jana1's
<>womb Ba1li feared that the actual birth of such a son
<>would jeopardise his lordship over the monkeys. To
<>ward off the threatened contingency, Ba1li, as advised
<>by Na1rada, let in the five metals (gold, copper, iron,
<>tin and zinc) in watery form into the stomach of
<>An5jana1. (This is a means of causing abortion). But,
<>the attempt misfired. Instead of the five metals killing
<>the child in An5jana1's womb, they became ear-orna-
<>ments for it, and Hanu1ma1n was thus born with orna-
<>ments in his ears. (Kam3ba Ra1ma1yan2a Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Naming and boons.%} As soon as Hanu1ma1n was born
<>An5jana1 was released from the curse, and she wanted to
<>return to heaven. The monkey child asked its mother
<>what its future would be and how it was to earn its
<>living. She assured him that he would never be
<>destroyed and that fruits as ripe as the rising sun (she
<>pointed the sun out to him) would form his food. And,
<>An5jana1 returned to heaven. [Page308-a+ 65]
<>Thinking that the glowing and glittering Sun was food
<>for him to be eaten, the monkey child made just one
<>jump at it (Sun) and quite neared it. But seeing Ra1hu,
<>bigger than the Sun he jumped at it. Then it was that
<>it saw Aira1vata and it tried to eat it. And, seeing this
<>attempt of the monkey-child, Indra used his vajra1yudha
<>(Thunderbolt) against it. The weapon hit its chin and
<>wounded it, and in precarious condition it fell down
<>on earth. Va1yu (Wind god) who saw his child falling
<>down wounded carried it off to Pa1ta1la.
<NI>When Va1yu (air) quitted the earth everything thereon
<>came to a dead-stop. Living things were on the verge
<>of death due to suffocation. And, then Brahma1 and
<>others went to Pa1ta1la, comforted Va1yu and congratu-
<>lated the monkey child. On the basis of Indra's vajra
<>having made a scar on its hanu (jaw-bone or chin) the
<>monkey child was named Hanu1ma1n by the Devas, who,
<>one by one blessed him as follows:--
<NI>Brahmadeva; May you live long, so long as Brahma1
<>exists.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u: May you live all your life as the greatest
<>devotee of God.
<NI>Indra: No weapon of any kind will wound or hit your
<>body.
<NI>Agni: Fire will never affect you.
<NI>Ka1la: May not death ever court you.
<NI>All the Devas: None will ever equal you in strength
<>and speed. Brahma1 blessed Hanu1ma1n again giving him
<>more physical power than Garud2a and Va1yu blessed
<>him to have more speed than himself. (air). (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 15; Uttarara1ma1yan2a;
<>Kambara1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a; Adbhutara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%Education.%} Being born of S4iva and on account of
<>the S4ivas4akti in him, Hanu1ma1n reached boyhood
<>immediately. To learn the four Vedas and the six
<>s4a1stras he chose Su1rya mentally as his preceptor, and
<>approached him with the request to be taught the
<>Vedas etc. Su1rya agreed to have Hanu1ma1n as his dis-
<>ciple subject to the condition that the latter would not
<>be permitted to sit with the Ba1lakhilyas in his (Su1rya's)
<>chariot and study. Hanu1ma1n agreed to the condition
<>to learn from Su1rya walking in front of him. With
<>book opened in his hand and concentrating all his atten-
<>tion on the face of Su1rya Hanu1ma1n traversed the sky
<>and within a short period of sixty hours he mastered all
<>the Vedas and the s4a1stras thoroughly well. Though
<>Su1rya said that he would consider the great interest
<>Hanu1ma1n took in his studies as daks2in2a1 (tuition fee)
<>Hanu1ma1n wanted Su1rya to accept something more by
<>way of daks2in2a1, and Su1rya said as follows:--“If you
<>are so very particular about offering me something
<>more as daks2in2a1 I shall tell you. My son Sugri1va is
<>living on earth with Ba1li and he is not as strong and
<>powerful as Ba1li. You be of help to Sugri1va as his
<>minister and constant companion.”
<NI>Happy at Su1rya's words Hanu1ma1n returned to the
<>forest and lived as Sugri1va's minister for the rest of his
<>life.
<NI>4) {%S4ri1 Ra1ma's servant.%} From the day he met S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>after the abduction of Si1ta1 by Ra1van2a till Ra1ma's death
<>his story is inextricably connected with that of Ra1ma.
<>(See under Ra1ma).
<NI>5) {%His music.%} Once in a musical competition Hanu1-
<>ma1n defeated Na1rada. (Adbhutara1ma1yan2a; also see
<>Para 8 under Na1rada). [Page308-b+ 64]
<NI>6) {%S4ivalin3ga at Ra1mes4varam.%} There is a story in the
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a of Ra1ma1yan2a connecting Hanu1ma1n with
<>the S4ivalin3ga installed in the temple at Ra1mes4varam.
<>(See under Ra1mes4varam).
<NI>7) {%Lost his divine power.%} Once due to a curse of sage
<>Tr2n2abindu Hanu1ma1n lost his great strength and vita-
<>lity. But, he would regain the lost power when one
<>reminded him of it. During the search for Si1ta1 Hanu-
<>ma1n felt it difficult to jump across the southern sea to
<>Lan3ka1 due to the above curse. But, when Ja1mbava1n
<>described to him about his noble origin and powers
<>Hanu1ma1n regained his lost power and vitality, and
<>successfully jumped across the sea to Lan3ka1. (See
<>Tr2n2abindu II, Para 2).
<NI>8) {%A fort made of tail.%} He made a fort of his tail and
<>saved Ra1ma and Laks2man2a within it. (See Pa1ta1la-
<>ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>9) {%Hanu1ma1n and Sahasramukha Ra1van2a.%} (See Sahasra-
<>mukha Ra1van2a).
<NI>10) {%Hanu1ma1n and S4atrughna.%} S4atrughna, who conducted
<>the horse in connection with the As4vamedha performed
<>by S4ri1 Ra1ma after his return from exile in the forest,
<>fell down unconscious in his fight with King Vi1raman2i,
<>and then Hanu1ma1n brought a herbal medicine called
<>‘Dron2a’ from the Hima1layas and with its aid brought
<>back S4atrughna to consciousness. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>11) {%Taken captive by Kus4a and Lava.%} The Yajn5a1s4va
<>(sacrificial horse) of the As4vamedha yajn5a of S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>led by a contingent of Ra1ma's army was resting in a
<>tent put up near the hermitage of Gautama when Kus4a
<>and Lava together captured the horse. Hanu1ma1n, who
<>rushed over to the spot on receiving intimation of the
<>news was bound hand and foot with creepers by Kus4a
<>and Lava and dragged to the hermitage. Si1ta1, was then
<>in the hermitage brooding over the past, and the re-
<>petition of the word ‘Ra1ma’ by the humiliated Hanu1ma1n
<>awoke her from her reverie. She was taken aback to
<>see Hanu1ma1n there in that plight and got him released
<>from captivity by her sons. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Uttaraka1n2d2a).
<NI>12) {%Old age.%} Having witnessed Ra1ma1vata1ra (incar-
<>nation of Ra1ma) to its very end, Hanu1ma1n, who had
<>by now become quite old, spent his days guarding the
<>Kadali1 forest. Bhi1ma, who happened to go there to
<>collect Saugandhika flowers got defeated in fight by
<>Hanu1ma1n. (See Bhi1ma, Para 7).
<NI>13) {%Arjuna's flag-Symbol%} (See under Arjuna 17B).
<NI>14) {%Idols of Hanu1ma1n.%} When an idol of Hanu1ma1n is

<>replied as follows:-
<NI>“In the past birth you were a truthful and pure-
<>hearted vais4ya; you gave up your own profession and
<>so you were ousted from home by your own people. At
<>that time a famine and other scarcity conditions
<>occurred there. One day you got into a pond along
<>with your wife, collected lotus flowers from it and went
<>to Ka1s4i1 to sell the flowers. But, no one purchased the
<>flowers. At last, Candramati1, daughter of Indradyumna [Page310-a+ 64]
<>purchased the flowers for a yajn5a she was performing.
<>When you saw Vis2n2u installed along with A1dityabha-
<>gava1n (Sun-God) and worshipped with flowers, fee-
<>lings of devotion swept your mind and you too wor-

<HI>HARITA1S4VA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A King born in the solar dynasty. In the
<>art of music he defeated Na1rada and shamed Sarasvati1
<>(Goddess of language), pleased Brahma1 and by the
<>melody of his music sent Vis2n2u to sleep. The mounting
<>achievements of the King in the art of music evoked
<>jealousy in S4ivas4an3kara, the lord of music. When
<>S4an3karamu1rti in a competitive spirit played the ra1ga
<>S4an3kara1bharan2a (a particular tune) Harita1s4va) pointed
<>out that S4a1ntarasa (the calmness and poise) which was
<>suited to that ra1ga had given place to raudra rasa
<>which was a serious mistake. Enraged at this S4iva
<>opened his eye of fire at the King who retorted boldly
<>thus, ‘even if the eye of fire was opened a mistake was a
<>mistake’. This stand of the King pleased S4iva so much
<>that he bestowed on the King boons and good wishes
<>as presents for his (king's) victory over all.
<NI>2) {%Killed Andhaka.%} Andhaka1sura conquered Svarga
<>and took Indra prisoner during the period when Hari-
<>ta1s4va was King. The combined efforts of Brahma1, Vis2n2u
<>and S4iva could not kill Andhaka. At last at the ins-
<>tance of Br2haspati a representative of the Devas visited
<>Harita1s4va at Ayodhya1 and sought his help to kill Andh-
<>aka and accordingly the King set out for war against
<>the demon. Agastya told the King in secret that Andh-
<>aka treasured an image of S4iva and Pa1rvati1 in his
<>stomach, and after removing, with his arrows the idol
<>from his stomach, Harita1s4va killed him and restored [Page310-b+ 65]

<>praises of Maha1vis2n2u. It contains three parts called
<>respectively Harivam3s4a Parva, Vis2n2u Parva, and Bha-
<>vis2ya Parva. Creation of the world, kings of the solar
<>dynasty and of the lunar dynasty, Yadu dynasty and the
<>birth of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a form the theme of Harivam3s4a Parva.
<>Vis2n2u Parva deals mainly with the pranks and games
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in his childhood. Though there occur
<>certain hints about the future at the beginning of the
<>Bhavis2ya Parva, the creation of the world, the incar-
<>nation of Vis2n2u as Va1mana (Dwarf) and as Narasim3ha
<>(half man and half lion), S4iva and Vis2n2u constitute its
<>main theme.

<>composed by Vya1sa.

<>(Hayagri1va) should not be killed by anyone but by a

<HI>HAYAGRI1VA V. An incarnation of Vis2n2u.
<NI>1) {%In Vedic literature:%}--In Vedic literature incarnation
<>as Hayagri1va is attributed not to Vis2n2u, but to Yajn5a.
<>But the Taittiri1ya a1ran2yaka depicts yajn5a as a proto-
<>form of Vis2n2u. The inference that may be drawn from
<>the above is that the root of the Hayagri1va story
<>detailed in Vedic and Pura1n2ic literature is one and the
<>same.
<NI>About the Hayagri1va incarnation the Pan5cavim3sa-
<>bra1hman2a contains the following story.

<>yajn5a on the understanding that the havirbha1ga
<>obtained from it should be divided among all the [Page312-a+ 64]
<>Devas. But, in violation of the agreement, yajn5a left
<>the place carrying away the whole Yajn5abha1ga with
<>him, and he drove back the Devas who followed him
<>with the help of the bow presented to him by Devi1.
<>Finally the Devas got the string of the bow bitten off
<>by termites and the bow which got straightened up
<>cut off yajn5a's head. Yajn5a then apologized for his
<>offence and then the devas got the As4vini1devas to fix
<>the head of a horse to the trunk of Yajn5a. (Pan5ca-
<>vim3s4abra1hman2a 7, 5, 6; Taittiri1ya a1ran2yaka 5, 1;
<>Taittiri1ya Sam3hita1, 4-9, 1).
<NI>2) {%In Pura1n2ic literature.%} The above story is told in
<>Skanda Pura1n2a with slight modifications as follows:-
<NI>Once Brahma1 and other Devata1s conducted a test as to
<>which one amongst them was the greatest, and when
<>it became evident tha tMaha1vis2n2u was, in every respect,
<>superior to all the others Brahma1 cursed that Vis2n2u
<>should lose his head. Vis2n2u, who got thus bereft of his
<>head attended a yajn5a conducted by the Devas with the
<>head of a horse attached to his trunk. After the yajn5a
<>was over he went to dharma1ran2ya and did tapas there

<>statement occurs about Himava1n. According to the
<>advice of King Janaka S4uka brahmars2i mounted the
<>Hima1layas. Siddha-ca1ran2as lived on the mountain.
<>Celestial women walked all over the place. The moun-
<>tain always reverberated with the noise of different
<>varieties of living beings. The noise produced by Kin-
<>naras, peacocks and many other birds could always be
<>heard there. Himava1n was the permanent abode of
<>Garud2a. The As2t2adikpa1lakas also lived there.
<NI>(32) When S4uka moved up to the world above it
<>appeared as though the Himava1n was being cut open.
<>He saw two divine peaks of mountains on the two
<>sides of the path; one of them was the peak of the
<>Maha1meru and the other that of Himava1n. Both the
<>peaks gave way to S4uka. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 333).
<NI>(33) S4iva desired to secure Uma1, the daughter of
<>Himava1n as his wife. Meantime sage Bhr2gu demanded
<>that Uma1 be wedded to him. When Himava1n told the
<>sage that it had already been decided to gave Uma1 in
<>marriage to S4iva, the Sage cursed that there would not
<>be, in future, gems in the Himava1n. (S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 342, Verse 62).
<NI>(34) Vis2n2u and S4iva once fought with each other on
<>the Himava1n, and then it seemed as though the moun-
<>tain was being cleft into pieces. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>342, Verse 122).
<NI>(35) Na1rada had his a1s4rama there, on the Himava1n.
<>(S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 346, Verse 3).
<NI>(36) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once visited the a1s4rama of Upamanyu
<>on the Himava1n. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 14, Verse
<>43).
<NI>(37) King Marutta performed a yajn5a on the Hima1la-
<>yas and brahmins went away leaving a lot of wealth
<>there. (A1s4vamedhika Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 20).
<NI>(38) San5jaya left for the Hima1layas after Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>and Ga1ndha1ri1 were burnt to death in a wild fire. (A1s4ra-
<>mava1sika Parva, Chapter 37, Verse 33).
<NI>(39) During their maha1prastha1na (great journey) the
<>Pa1n2d2avas travelled by the Hima1layas and Dharmaputra
<>ascended to heaven from the top of the Hima1layan peak.
<>(Maha1pra1stha1nika Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 1).
<HI>HIM3GULA. A mineral (vermillion) obtained from
<>mountainous regions. It has the colour (red) of the sky
<>at sunset. (Vana Parva, Chapter 158, Verse 94).
<HI>HIPPOCRAITUS. A Greek scientist and thinker. Father
<>of the Allopathic system of medicine. He has written
<>a book on medicine consisting of nearly seventy parts,
<>His theory is that the heart is the centre of origin of
<>life and the heat of the body is the manifestation of life.
<>Out of the five elements of the Indian system of medi-
<>cine he accepts four, viz. Pr2thvi1 (earth), Ap (Water),
<>Agni (fire) and Va1yu (air). Till the 18th century A.D.
<>his theories were very popular.
<HI>HIRAN2MAYA(M3). A particular region in Jambu1
<>island, to the south of Ni1la mountain and to the north
<>of mount Nis2adha. (Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha).
<HI>HIRAN2YA. (Hiran2yakas4ipu, Hiran2ya1ks2a) [Page314-a+ 65]
<NI>1) {%General.%} Owing to a curse Jaya and Vijaya who were
<>gate-keepers at Vaikun2t2ha were born as two asuras,
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a (elder brother) and Hiran2yakas4ipu (youn-
<>ger brother). These brothers are known also as the
<>Hiran2yas. (See Jayavijayas).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three sons called Hiran2ya1ks2a, Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>and Vajra1n3ga and a daughter, Sim3hika1 were born to
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati by his wife Diti. To Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>were born four sons called Anuhla1da, Hla1da Prahla1da
<>and Sam3hla1da. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>There is yet another story relating to the birth of these
<>asuras. Though the other wives of Kas4yapa became
<>mothers Diti alone was not blessed with a child for a
<>long time. One day at dusk while Kas4yapa was immers-
<>ed in meditation Diti rushed into his room and began
<>lamenting and complaining about her having not yet
<>been made a mother, and urgently asked Kas4yapa to
<>make her one. But, Kas4yapa pointed out that it was
<>not the proper time for such things. It was dusk when
<>S4iva with his attendants would be out sight-seeing
<>covered with ashes from burning ghats spread all around
<>by storms. So Kas4yapa wanted to wait for some time
<>more. But, she was not in a mood to pay heed to his
<>advice and Kas4yapa had to yield to her proposal. After
<>obliging her, once again he took his bath and began
<>meditation.
<NI>Diti became pregnant. She also got alarmed about the
<>indiscretion committed at dusk time that day and,
<>Kas4yapa told her: “Your mind became impure, you
<>did not obey me, you insulted the Devas also. There
<>are two kids of a very low type in your womb. They
<>will oppress the three worlds and kill innocent people.
<>Maha1vis2n2u will never tolerate such things. He will
<>incarnate himself to kill them. But since you feel peni-
<>tent now, a grand-son of yours will become liked by all
<>good people, and he will be a great devotee of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. (This was Prahla1da).
<NI>At any rate, one hundred years after her getting preg-
<>nant Diti delivered twin sons. The first born was named
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a and the next one Hiran2yakas4ipu. (Accor-
<>ding to certain Pura1n2as Hiran2yakas4ipu was the first
<>born).
<NI>3) {%Hiran2ya1ks2a.%} The boys grew up to become a growing
<>menace to the whole world. Hiran2ya1ks2a toured all the
<>three worlds with a club. He besieged svarga. Devas ran
<>away in fear. Hiran2ya1ks2a, shaking his club, jumped
<>from the sky into the sea and engaged himself in the
<>sport of thrashing the waves with his club. Years passed
<>by like this, and at last he went to Vibha1vari1, the capi-
<>tal of Varun2a and challenged him to fight. Varun2a
<>came out of the palace, admitted his incapacity to fight
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a, and suggested to him to challenge Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. Accordingly he set out in search of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>It was during this period of time that the earth got engulf-
<>ed in water. Sva1yambhuvamanu requested his father,
<>Brahma1 to raise up the earth from water. But, nowhere
<>could be seen the earth, everywhere it was only a vast
<>expanse of water. Brahma1 then meditated upon Maha1
<>vis2n2u, who came out through Brahma1's nose in the form
<>of a tiny boar. It grew up into a very big boar within
<>no time, and jumped from the sky into the ocean, and
<>within a few minutes it picked up from under the
<>ocean the earth on its tusks and appeared on the surface
<>of the water. Hiran2ya1ks2a understood that the boar,
<>which without the least fear picked up the earth from [Page314-b+ 65]
<>Pa1ta1la was none other than Maha1visn2u and he chal-
<>lenged Vis2n2u to fight. After replacing the earth in its
<>old position Vis2n2u fought with Hiran2ya1ks2a and killed
<>him.
<NI>4) {%Hiran2yakas4ipu.%} With the killing of his brother,
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu's hatred and enmity towards Vis2n2u in-
<>creased very much. He, by doing tapas for very long
<>years, secured boons from Brahma1 and conquered the
<>three worlds and ruled them as Triloka Cakravarti
<>(Emperor of the three worlds). He prohibited through-
<>out the empire not only the chanting of Vis2n2u's name,
<>but even thinking about him (Vis2n2u) by his subjects.
<>“Hiran2ya1ya namah2” (salutations to Hiran2ya) replaced
<>the old custom of chanting ‘Na1ra1yan2a1ya namah2’ (salu-
<>tations to Na1ra1yan2a). Meantime, a son called Prahla1da,
<>a great devotee of Maha1vis2n2u was born to Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu. (For the story of Hiran2yakas4ipu's death see
<>Prahla1da). (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a; Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapter 20).
<NI>5) {%Story about the name Hiran2yakas4ipu.%} Sage Kas4yapa
<>once conducted an As4vamedha yajn5a. A golden seat
<>was put up there for the great sages who came to parti-
<>cipate in the yajn5a. Diti was pregnant during the time
<>of the yajn5a, and while it was duly progressing she one
<>day came and sat on the above-mentioned golden seat,
<>and very shortly she delivered a child. As the child was
<>delivered on the golden seat the child came to be called
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, 8, 5, 7-12; Va1yu
<>Pura1n2a 67, 69).

<>Anuva1ka 17, Su1kta 116) who was called Hiran2yahasta.
<>He became a sage and married the beautiful daughter

<HI>HIRAN2YAPURAM. A city of the Daityas. The Daitya
<>woman, Puloma1 got the city for her children by tapas.

<>Puloma1 are known as Ka1lakeyas for whose safety and
<>security she did tapas for 1000 years. And, when
<>Brahma1 asked her to choose any boon she desired,
<>Puloma1 said as follows:- “There should arise no reason
<>or cause for my sons to feel sorrow in their life; Devas,
<>snakes or Ra1ks2asas should not kill them and they must
<>have a beautiful city to live in. Brahma1 granted her all
<>the boons. Hiran2yapura was built by Brahma1 for the
<>Ka1lakeyas to live in. It was full of gems and it could
<>easily travel in the sky.
<NI>When life became impossible for the Devas due to the
<>depredations of the Ka1lakeyas, Indra brought
<>Arjuna to Devaloka. As the Ka1lakeyas were granted the
<>boon that they would not be killed by the Devas,
<>Arjuna's help had thus to be sought by Indra. Arjuna
<>killed the Ka1lakeyas and destroyed Hiran2yapura. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 173). On one occasion Na1rada gave
<>a correct description of Hiran2yapura to Ma1tali, the
<>charioteer of Indra. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 100).

<>Sudyumna. The Iks2va1ku family takes its source from
<>Iks2va1ku. The Kings of the solar dynasty were all born
<>in the Iks2va1ku family. This dynasty is named “Solar
<>Dynasty” because Iks2va1ku was born to Vivasva1n (Sun)
<>the son of Kas4yapa. In Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha
<>we see that Iks2va1ku was born from Manu's spittle. The
<>descendants of Iks2va1ku up to S4ri1 Ra1ma1's sons Lava and
<>Kus4a are given below:--
<NI>Iks2va1ku had three sons--Dan2d2a, Vikuks2i, and Nimi.
<>From Vikuks2i was born S4as4a1da; from S4as4a1da, Puran5-
<>jaya; from Puran5jaya, Kakutstha; from Kakutstha,
<>Anenas; from Anenas, Pr2thula1s4va; from Pr2thula1s4va
<>Prasenajit; from Prasenajit, Yuvana1s4va; and from
<>Yuvana1s4va was born Ma1ndha1ta1. Ambari1s2a, Mucukunda
<>and Purukutsa were the sons of Ma1ndha1ta1. Besides
<>them he had fifty daughters also. The sage Saubhari
<>married them. The family-tree continues again from
<>Purukutsa, one of the sons of Ma1ndha1ta1.
<NI>From Purukutsa, Trasadasyu was born; from Trasa-
<>dasyu, Anaran2ya; from Anaran2ya, Aryas4va; from Aryas4va,
<>Vasumanas; from Vasumanas, Sutanva1; from Sutanva1,

<>Rohita1s4va; from Rohita1s4va1, Harita; from Harita,
<>Cun5cu; from Cun5cu, Sudeva; from Sudeva, Bharuka
<>and from Bharuka Sagara was born. Sagara had two

<>60,000 children, while Kes4ini1 had a single son,
<>Asaman5jasa. Am3s4uma1n was the son of Asaman5jasa;
<>Bhagi1ratha was the son of Am3s4uma1n; S4rutana1bha was

<>Das4aratha had three wives. Kausalya1, Kaikeyi1 and
<>Sumitra1. S4ri1 Ra1ma was born to Kausalya1, Bharata,
<>was the son of Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1 had two sons,
<>Laks2man2a and S4atrughn2a. Lava and Kus4a were S4ri1
<>Ra1ma's sons by Si1ta1. (See the word Ka1la-
<>bra1hman2a)
<F>1) There are certain variations in the genealogy according to some Pura1n2as. The genealogy given above is based on Bha1gavata and
<>Agni Pura1n2a.</F>
<HI>ILA The name taken by Sudyumna when, after becom-
<>ing woman, he became man again. (See under ILA1 I).
<HI>ILA1 I. Daughter of Vaivasvata Manu.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in this order:--
<>Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Vaivasvata Manu--Ila1.
<>Vaivasvata Manu was the son of Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Aditi, and Ila1 the daughter of Vaivasvata Manu by his
<>wife, S4raddha1. Iks2va1ku, the ancestral father of the solar
<>dynasty of Kings was brother of Ila1.
<NI>2) Vaivasvata Manu and S4raddha1 had, for a long
<>time no children. Manu got performed once by Agastya
<>a yajn5a to propitiate the Mitra1varun2as so that a son
<>might be born to him (Manu). Soon a daughter was
<>born to him and she was called Ila1. Then Manu
<>asked Vasis2tha why a daughter was born to him
<>instead of a son for whom the yajn5a was performed by
<>Agastya. At once, Vasis2tha by his will-power turned
<>the girl Ila1 into a boy, and the boy was named Sud-
<>yumna. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Sudyumna again turned into woman.%} Once S4unaka
<>and some other sages went to the great forest Kuma1ra
<>Vana near Kaila1sa to salute Sri Parames4vara ignorant
<>of the fact that just then Pa1rvati1 and Parmes4vara were
<>enjoying themselves. The sudden appearance of S4unaka
<>and others was not relished by the divine couple, who
<>were then naked. They therefore, pronounced the curse
<>that anybody who entered the forest in future would be
<>turned into a woman. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>Sudyumna, now a young man, went for hunting one day.
<>Sudyumna who was ignorant of this curse entered this
<>forest with his friends while hunting. At once all of
<>them were transformed into women. Grief-stricken,
<>they stayed in the forest for some days, and then started
<>for the palace. Sudyumna bearing the name Ila1 walked
<>at the head of the party as a beautiful woman. On the
<>way Budha met Ila1, they fell in love with each other
<>and got married. A son, Puru1ravas was born to Budha
<>by Ila1. (Bha1gavata). [Page317-b+ 61]
<NI>4) {%Transformation again;%} Ila1 expressed to Vasis2t2ha, her
<>grief at having been turned into a woman, the sage
<>requested S4ri1 Parames4vara to restore her to her former
<>form as a man. S4iva said that Ila1 would be a man and
<>a woman every alternate month, throughout life. Dur-
<>ing the month when she was a man he would engage
<>himself in matters of Government, and the next month,
<>when a woman, she would stay in the inner apartments
<>in the palace. Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 32 says
<>that Iks2va1ku, brother of Puru1ravas ruled the state till
<>the latter became a major. As soon as Puru1ravas
<>attained majority Sudyumna handed over to him the
<>reins of Government and retired to the forest for tapas,
<>and during this period he was taught the Nava1ks2ara
<>mantra by sage Na1rada. Sudyumna adored Devi1 with
<>this Mantra. She appeared to him and blessed him with
<>the state of salvation. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>Puru1ravas married Urvas4i1, and ruled the country.
<>(Bha1gavata, 9th Skandha; Devi1 Bha1gavata, First Skan-
<>dha; M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 75 and Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 26).
<HI>ILA1 II. A river. At the birth of Subrahman2ya this river
<>paid homage to him with fruits and roots. (M.B. Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 86, Verse 24). Dharmaputra
<>along with the brahmins bathed in this river. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 156, Verse 8).
<HI>ILA1SPADA. An ancient holy bathing ghat. A dip in the
<>holy waters wards off ill-fate and confers the benefits
<>of the Va1japeya yajn5a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 83,
<>Verses 77, 78).
<HI>ILA1VARTA (ILA1VR2TA). A King in the line of Priyav-
<>rata, son of Sva1yambhuva Manu, (See Genealogy).
<HI>ILA1VR2TA (ILAVR2TTA). A locality. (See Bhu1gun2ita).
<HI>ILA1VR2TA VARS2A. That part of the country in the
<>centre of Jambu1dvi1pa. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>28).
<HI>ILAVU. See Va1yu, Para 6.
<HI>ILIBILA1. The wife of Vis4ravas and mother of Kubera.
<>Vis4ravas was born as the son of Pulastya, one of the
<>Praja1patis by Ma1nini1. Vis4ravas had two wives, Kaikasi1
<>and Ilibila1 alias Devavarn2ini1 and Vais4ravan2a (Kubera)
<>was born of Ilibila1. Hence Kubera is called Ailibili
<>also; To Vis4ravas was born by Kaikasi1, Ra1van2a, Vibhi1-
<>s2an2a, Kumbhakarn2a and S4u1rpan2akha1.
<HI>ILILA. A King of Pu1ruvam3s4a; father of King Dus2yanta.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 71). Rathantari1 was Ilila's
<>wife. (A1di Parva, Chapter 74). Some Pura1n2as call
<>Ilila by the name I1lina and Rathantari1 as Ratham3dari1
<>also.
<NI>Matina1ra, the most righteous of Kings had four sons
<>endowed with great prowess named Tam3su, Maha1n,
<>Atiratha and Druhyu. Tam3su was responsible for the
<>growth of the Pu1ru dynasty. He conquered the whole
<>of earth and won fame. I1lina was Tam3su's son. He also
<>conquered the whole world, and he had five sons. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verses 14-18).
<HI>I1LINA. Son of king Tam3su of the Pu1ru dynasty. His
<>wife was Rathantari1. I1lina had five sons by her. They
<>were: Dus2yanta, S4u1ra, Bhi1ma, Pravasu and Vasu.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 16-18. See also under the
<>word Ilila). [Page318-a+ 65]
<HI>ILLAKA. A person who led a very ideal family life.
<>Son of a Vais4ya in the city of Mathura1, Illaka had a
<>very beautiful wife. Illaka had one day to go to ano-
<>ther place and his wife wanted to accompany him. But,
<>Illaka did not allow that and went alone. Then she
<>waited at the gates looking towards the husband moving
<>fast away. And, when he completely disappeared from
<>sight she, who could not bear the separation, fell down
<>on the spot and expired. Illaka heard about the death
<>and without delay, he hurried back home. He placed
<>the dead body of his wife on his lap and wept. Weeping
<>thus he also expired. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3-
<>baka, Taran3ga I).
<HI>ILVALA. An Asura, who lived in the Man2imati1 city.
<>Ilvala and his brother Va1ta1pi ate up a number of brah-
<>mins and Agastya cursed them to death. (See Agastya).
<HI>INDIA. ‘South S4arakh’, a newspaper published from
<>the United Arab Republic with the assistance of the
<>Indian Embassy gives the following account of how the
<>land originally known as ‘Bha1rata’ came to be called
<>India. The name ‘India’ was given to “Bha1rata” by
<>the Arabs. Even from very early times, Arabs used to
<>give the name ‘Hind’ to their girls. In ancient Arabic
<>love poems, this name could be seen very frequently.
<>There were commercial and cultural contacts between
<>Bha1rata and Arab lands, from very old times. The
<>words ‘Kharan Fu1l’ (spices) ‘Pulfu1l’ (Pepper) etc.
<>may be seen in Arabic poems of the pre-Islamic period.
<>These contacts became more intimate in later years and
<>the Arabs began to take very great interest in the pro-
<>ducts and the people of this country. They began to
<>call ‘Bha1rata’ by the pet name ‘Hind’ which they
<>used for their little children. They began to use the
<>term ‘Al Hind’ when referring to Bha1rata in their
<>poems, records and trade agreements In course of time
<>this was shortened to ‘Hind’ and finally became
<>‘INDIA’.
<HI>INDI1VARA1KS2A. A Gandharva. He was the son of
<>Nalana1bha, the chief of the Vidya1dharas. There is a
<>story about this Gandharva in Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 60:--
<NI>Indi1vara1ks2a went to the sage Brahmamitra to learn
<>A1yurveda. For some unknown reason, the sage did not
<>teach him. Indi1vara1ks2a decided to learn by overhearing
<>what the guru taught the other pupils from a hiding
<>place. In six months’ time he learnt A1yurveda. Over-
<>joyed at the thought that he was able to acquire as
<>much learning in this science as the other pupils, with-
<>in such a short time, and oblivious of his surroundings,
<>he laughed loudly. The guru who understood the secret,
<>uttered a curse that he would become a Ra1ks2asa within
<>seven days. The repentant Indi1vara1ks2a begged for his
<>pardon. Then the sage told him that he would be
<>restored to his own form and give up the Ra1ks2asa shape
<>when he was shot with arrows by his own children.
<NI>Once when he approached his daughter Manorama1
<>to devour her, his son-in law, Svarocis who had learnt
<>the science of archery from that girl, defeated him. In
<>this way, Indi1vara1ks2a got his own former form. After
<>that he taught Svarocis, the sciences of archery which
<>he had learnt from his own daughter and also from
<>Brahmamitra.
<HI>INDI1VARASENA. Son of Paritya1gasena a King who
<>ruled the city of Ira1vati1. Paritya1gasena had two
<>queens--Adhikasam3gama1 and Ka1vya1lan3ka1ra. As they [Page318-b+ 64]
<>had no children, the distressed King with his queens
<>worshipped the goddess Durga1. Durga1 gave the King
<>two fruits. She blessed that the queens would bear
<>children when they ate the fruits. Adhikasam3gama1 ate
<>both the fruits without showing them to the other wife.
<>Two sons were born to her. Indi1varasena was the elder
<>son. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Ratnaprabha1 lam3baka, 8th
<>Taran3ga).
<HI>INDRA.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Vis2n2u--Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kasyapa--
<>Indra.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapa was born to Mari1ci, the eldest of
<>the spiritual sons of Brahma1. Indra was the son of
<>Kas4yapa and Aditi, the eldest daughter of Daks2a. The
<>twelve sons who were born to Kas4yapa and Aditi are
<>called A1dityas. The twelve A1dityas are--Dha1ta1, Aryama1,
<>Mitra, Rudra, Varun2a, Su1rya, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1,
<>Savita1, Tvas2t2a1, and Vis2n2u. In addition to them, Aditi
<>had twentyone sons more. Indra is the eldest of the 33
<>sons. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verses 9-15).
<NI>Indra became the ruler of the Devas. Aira1vata is
<>Indra's elephant, Uccais4s4ravas, his horse, and Vajra his
<>weapon. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 51, M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 18).
<NI>3) {%Indra and Garud2a.%} Kas4yapa had two sons, Garud2a
<>and Arun2a by Vinata1 and a large number of Na1gas by
<>his other wife, Kadru1. Kadru1 and her children kept
<>Vinata1 and her son Garud2a as their servants. Kadru1
<>agreed to set them free if they brought Amr2ta from
<>Devaloka.
<NI>Once Kadru1 and her children asked Garud2a to carry
<>them to the beautiful Na1ga1laya in the middle of the
<>ocean. Garud2a carried them on his shoulders and flew
<>very high near the sky. The excessive heat of the sun
<>made the Na1gas unconscious. Kadru1, in her distress,
<>prayed to Indra. Indra showered rain and cooled the
<>atmosphere. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 25, Verses 7-
<>17). They reached the lovely island in the middle of
<>the ocean.
<NI>Garud2a decided to earn his freedom by bringing Amr2ta
<>from Devaloka. With determination, he flew up into
<>heaven and secured Amr2ta. The enraged Indra attack-
<>ed him with his weapon, Vajra. But Garud2a spread
<>his feathers in such a way that he was not wounded.
<>Indra was struck with wonder, and pleased with the
<>beautiful feathers (Parn2a) of Garud2a, named him
<>‘Suparn2a’. At last Indra was pleased and allowed
<>Garud2a to take Amr2ta with him. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 32, Verses 18-25).
<NI>4) {%How Indra came to have 1000 eyes.%} (See Tilottama1, 2nd
<>Para).
<NI>5) {%Indra and Arjuna.%} (1) Kunti1, Pa1n2d2u's wife had
<>received five mantras from Durva1sas for begetting sons.
<>One of those Mantras was chanted meditating on the
<>sun even before she was married and Karn2a was born.
<>After marriage she used three more of the Mantras and
<>three sons were born to her from Yama, Va1yu and
<>Indra respectively. The fifth Mantra was presented to
<>Ma1dri1 the other wife of Pa1n2d2u. Thus Arjuna was the
<>son of Kunti1 by Indra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>123).
<NI>(2) There is a story of a rivalry between Indra and
<>Arjuna in the Maha1bha1rata. (See under ‘Kha1n2d2a-
<>vada1ha’). [Page319-a+ 65]
<NI>(3) During their life in the forest, once Arjuna
<>started to Kaila1sa to worship S4iva. On the way Indra
<>appeared before him and showered his blessings on
<>him. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 41, Verses 15, 16).
<NI>(4) During his life in the forest, Indra presented to
<>Arjuna who visited him in Indra's residence, a Gandh-
<>arva named Citrasena as his companion. Citrasena
<>taught him music, dance, etc. (M.B. Aran2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 44, Verse 9).
<NI>(5) At the palace of Indra, as secretly instructed by
<>Indra, Urvas4i1 approached Arjuna with advances of
<>love. Arjuna who refused to yield to her temptations
<>was turned into a eunuch by her curse. But Indra
<>lifted the curse by saying that this curse would be an
<>advantage to him during the incognito life of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. It was Citrasena who was used as a tool by
<>Indra to test Arjuna's self control. (M.B. Aran2ya
<>Parva, Chapters 44, 45).
<NI>(6) In order to ensure Arjuna's victory in battle,
<>Indra, disguised as a Brahmin, obtained by begging
<>Karn2a's ear-rings. (M.B. Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 310).
<NI>6) {%Indra and Vr2tra1sura.%} A famous exploit of Indra was
<>the killing of Vr2tra1sura. Under the leadership of
<>Vr2tra1sura, the Ka1lakeyas and many other Ra1ks2asas
<>besieged the Devas. The battle raged furiously. Indra
<>fell down unconscious owing to the shower of arrows
<>from Vr2tra. At once Vasis2t2ha with his divine power
<>restored Indra to consciousness. Finding it impossible to
<>kill Vr2tra, the nonplussed Devas under the leadership of
<>Indra approached Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u told them that
<>Vr2tra could be killed only with the bone of the sage
<>Dadhi1ca. So all of them approached Dadhi1ca. Realising
<>the situation, Dadhi1ca let Indra have his bone for the
<>purpose. Indra made his weapon Vajra with that bone
<>and receiving a fatal stroke from it, Vr2tra fell down
<>dead. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 101, Verses 14, 15;
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 281, Verses 13-21).
<NI>By killing Vr2tra Indra incurred the sin of Brahmahatya1.
<>To expiate for that sin the Devas and R2s2is took Indra
<>to Sarayu1 river and performed his holy bath there.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, 24th Sarga).
<NI>(For further details about Vr2tra1sura see under Vr2tra1-
<>sura).
<NI>7) {%Indra and Cyavana.%} Indra did not allow the As4vini1-
<>devas to drink soma juice. The sad As4vini1devas left
<>Indraloka and while passing through a forest, they met
<>Sukanya1, wife of the sage Cyavana. She was extremely
<>beautiful. The As4vini1devas advised her to become their
<>wife instead of being the wife of the blind Cyavana.
<>But Sukanya1 rejected their advice. Pleased by her
<>conjugal fidelity, they restored Cyavana's eyesight and
<>made him a youth with beautiful eyes. In his gratitude,
<>Cyavana promised to get permission for them to drink
<>soma juice. He performed a ya1ga. Indra, As4vini1 devas
<>and other gods attended it. Indra insisted that the
<>As4vini1s should not be allowed to drink Soma juice.
<>Cyavana disputed with him and in the dispute Indra
<>was defeated. From that time the As4vini1s were allowed
<>Soma drinking. See also ‘Cyavana’. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 124, Verse 14; Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 156, Verses 16-31).
<NI>8) {%Indra and Tris4iras.%} Indra's brother Tvas2t2r2 did not
<>like some of Indra's activities. With the object of
<>rebuking Indra, Tvas2t2r2 begot a son named Vis4varu1pa,
<>Vis4varu1pa had three faces and so he was also called [Page319-b+ 65]
<>Tris4iras. With one face he used to recite Vedas, with
<>the second he drank alcohol and he used the third face
<>for observing the world. He performed a rigorous
<>tapas. Indra, who was alarmed at it, sent goddesses to
<>allure him, but in vain. At last Indra himself went to
<>the forest riding on his elephant Aira1vata and killed
<>Tris4iras with his Vajra1yudha. In his violent fury he
<>had the three heads of Tris4iras cut by a carpenter.
<>From that day, it was ordained that the head of the
<>cow sacrificed at ya1gas should be given to a carpenter.
<>Tvas2t2r2 who was enraged by Indra's killing of his son
<>Tris4iras, begot another son Vr2tra1sura. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>6th Skandha).
<NI>9) {%Indra and Nahus2a.%} See the word Agastya.
<NI>10) {%Indra and Bali.%} When Indra defeated and drove
<>away the Asuras, Maha1bali, the Asura emperor assu-
<>med the form of an ass and hid himself in an empty
<>house. Brahma1 informed Indra of this. Indra found
<>him out there, but set him free without killing at the
<>behest of Brahma1. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 223).
<NI>11) {%Indra and Yaya1ti.%} Yaya1ti was the son of Nahus2a. In
<>his old age, he handed over the kingly duties to his
<>younger son Pu1ru and went to the forest for performing
<>penance. After performing penance, he reached
<>Indraloka in the end. Indra did not like Yaya1ti's boast
<>that there was none who had greater power of tapas
<>than himself. Indra pushed him down to the world.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 88).
<NI>12) {%Indra and S4aradva1n.%} S4aradva1n was born as the son of
<>Sage Gautama. S4aradva1n started a penance for acquir-
<>ing divine arrows. Devendra who was alarmed, sent the
<>Apsara1 woman Ja1napati1 to obstruct his tapas. Deeply
<>affected by her irresistible charm and fascinated by
<>her temptations, he had an involuntary emission of
<>semen, which fell on the S4arastamba and split itself into
<>two parts. Two children a boy and a girl, were born
<>from it. The King's servants brought them to
<>Hastina1pura. The boy was named Kr2pa and the girl
<>was named Kr2pi1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130).
<NI>13) {%Indra and King Kuru.%} The King named Kuru was
<>once ploughing the field at the place known as Kuru-
<>ks2etra. (This was long before Kuruks2etra became
<>famous as the battlefield of Bha1rata Yuddha). Indra
<>who happened to come that way at the time, seeing the
<>King tilling the land, asked him why he was doing so.
<>The King replied that he was performing a ya1ga to
<>enable the men who fell dead there, to attain Heaven.
<>Indra returned to Heaven, smiling. Other devas came
<>to know of this from Indra. They said that if all men
<>came to Devaloka, the share of yajn5a which was to be
<>received by the gods, would be diminished and so they
<>advised Indra to go and give some boon to King Kuru.
<>Indra returned to earth and gave his blessing to Kuru
<>as follows:
<NI>The following classes of people will attain heaven if
<>they die there (at Kuruks2etra).
<NI>(1) Those who die of starvation.
<NI>(2) Those who die fighting heroically.
<NI>(3) Those who were men in their previous life, but
<>who have been born as animals.
<NI>From that time Kuruks2etra became an important
<>place. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 53).
<NI>14) {%Indra and Taks2aka.%} Indra's friend, a Na1ga named
<>Taks2aka lived in Kha1n2d2ava forest. When Agni burned
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest, Indra caused the rain to fall in order [Page320-a+ 65]
<>to save Taks2aka. See under ‘Kha1n2d2avada1ha’. (M.B.
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 235).
<NI>For the story of how Indra saved Taks2aka from the
<>Sarpasatra see under ‘A1stika’.
<NI>15) {%Indra and Kha1n2d2avada1ha.%} At the time of
<>Kha1n2d2avada1ha, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna fought against
<>Devendra.
<NI>16) {%Indra Sabha1.%} Maya undertook to build a sabha1
<>(assembly hall) for the Pa1n2d2avas at Indraprastha.
<>When it was being discussed, the sage Na1rada described
<>to them Indra's sabha1 as given below:--
<NI>Indra has a Sabha1 which dazzles with divine effulgence.
<>It is 150 yojanas in length and 100 yojanas in breadth.
<>It has a height of five yojanas. Beautiful storeyed
<>buildings and divine trees add to the grandeur of the
<>sabha1. Indra is seated within the holy light in it.
<>S4aci1devi1 takes her seat near him. Indra is very hand-
<>some. He wears a crown, he is dressed in spotlessly
<>pure clothes, and wears a garland round his neck.
<>Maruts, Siddhas, Devas, R2s2is and a host of others
<>stand around attending on him. They are all bright with
<>the halo of fire. Para1s4ara, Parvata, Sa1varn2i, Ga1lava,
<>S4am2kha, Likhita, Gauras4iras, Durva1sas, Akrodhana,
<>S4yena, Di1rghatamas, Pavitrapa1n2i, Bha1luvi, Ya1jn5avalkya,
<>Udda1laka, S4vetaketu, Pa1n2d2ya and other famous sages
<>are members of Indra's assembly. In this way, Indra's
<>Sabha1 is the most magnificent. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 7).
<NI>17) {%Indra and Ka1madhenu.%} Once Indra saw Surabhi, the
<>Ka1madhenu, crying in the Indraloka. He asked her
<>why she was crying. Surabhi answerd: “My Lord, the
<>cattle, who are my children are groaning in the world
<>under the yoke of the farmer. I was overwhelmed with
<>grief at the sight of their sufferings” Indra's heart meltt-
<>ed due to Ka1madhenu's tears. He caused very heavy
<>showers in the world when ploughing the fields became
<>impossible. In this way as a result of Surabhi's tears
<>Indra caused heavy rainfall which gave rest to the cattle
<>in the world. (M.B. Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 9).
<NI>18) {%Indra and Nala.%} Nala proceeded to Vidarbha to
<>attend Damayanti1's Svayam3vara. On the way, the four
<>gods, Indra, Agni, Varun2a and Yama met him. (For
<>further details see the word ‘Nala’). Nala married
<>Damayanti with the blessings of these gods. When the
<>devas returned, they met Kali and Dva1para. to whom
<>they described Nala's marriage. Kali and Dva1para who
<>wished to marry Damayanti1, naturally felt disappointed
<>and angry. Kali was about to pronounce a curse on
<>Nala. But on the advice of Devendra he did not do so.
<>Still he decided to gain secret entrance into Nala's
<>body and to bring about the loss of his Kingdom.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>19) {%Indra and Ma1ndha1ta1.%} A King named Yuvana1s4va
<>was born in the Iks2va1ku dynasty. He earned great
<>reputation by performing many As4vamedha ya1gas. But
<>he was very much distressed because he had no child-
<>ren. So he entrusted his kingly duties to his ministers
<>and proceeded to the forest. One day during his wande-
<>ring he arrived at the a1s4rama of the sage Bhr2gu. He
<>was tired and thirsty. Bhr2gu had filled a pot with
<>water by reciting a mantra and placing it on a low
<>stool, he had gone to sleep. Not knowing that it was
<>a pot of water intended to cause pregnancy, and in his
<>intense thirst, Yuvana1s4va drank water from it. He be-
<>came pregnant and in due course Yuvana1s4va brought [Page320-b+ 65]
<>forth a son. Indra, accompanied by other gods came
<>to see the child. When the Devas asked how the child
<>was going to drink milk, Indra put his index finger into
<>the child's mouth and the child began to suck it. Indra
<>said “The child will drink me”. The Sanskrit words
<>“Ma1m3 dha1ta1” mean “one who drinks me”. Thus the
<>child was named “Ma1ndha1ta1” by Indra and the other
<>gods. (M.B. Aran2ya Parva Chapter 126).
<NI>20) {%Indra and S4ibi.%} Once Indra and Agni tested the
<>strength of Emperor S4ibi's ‘dharma’. Indra took the
<>form of an eagle and Agni that of a dove. The dove flew
<>down into the lap of S4ibi. The eagle pursued it. The
<>dove entreated S4ibi to save it from the eagle. S4ibi pro-
<>mised to do so. The eagle argued that the dove was its
<>prey and should be returned to it. But S4ibi offered to
<>give the eagle his own flesh, equal in weight to that of
<>the dove. Accordingly, the dove was placed in one pan,
<>but even when all the flesh from his body was cut and
<>placed in the other pan, it did not weigh equal to the
<>dove. At this stage, Indra and Agni appeared to S4ibi
<>in their own forms and blessed him to be more happy
<>and prosperous than before. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 131).
<NI>21) {%Indra and Yavakri1ta.%} Long ago there was a sage
<>named Yavakri1ta. He started a tapas with the ambition
<>of acquiring all knowledge by himself, without the help
<>of a Guru. Indra was alarmed at the sternness and
<>rigour of the tapas. He induced Yavakri1ta to stop
<>tapas, but it was in vain. At last Indra disguised him-
<>self as an old Brahmin and went to the bank of the
<>Gan3ga1 where Yavakri1ta was performing tapas. He
<>began to build a dam across the river with sand. Seeing
<>this Yavakri1ta ridiculed him. The old Brahmin retorted
<>that Yavakri1ta's tapas was also equally ridiculous. But
<>Yavakri1ta was not shaken even by his taunt. He resum-
<>ed his tapas with renewed strength. At last finding
<>no other alternative, Indra appeared to Yavakri1ta and
<>granted his wish. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 135).
<NI>22) {%Loss of Indra's umbrella.%} Once Naraka1sura went
<>to heaven, fought with the gods and robbed Indra of his
<>umbrella and the earrings of Aditi, Indra's mother.
<>Grief-stricken Indra complained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Accom-
<>panied by Satyabha1ma1 and riding on the back of
<>Garud2a, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went to the city of Pra1gjyotis2a, the
<>residence of Naraka1sura and razed it to the ground. He
<>recovered the umbrella and ear-rings and returned to
<>heaven with Satyabha1ma1. Indra and Aditi were over-
<>joyed on getting back the lost articles. On their return
<>journey, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a at the request of Satyabha1ma1 cut
<>for her a twig of the Pa1rija1ta tree. This made Indra
<>angry and he fought against S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. After defeating
<>Indra and other gods, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a accompanied by Sat-
<>yabha1ma1 returned to Dva1raka1 with the Pa1rija1ta. (Bha1-
<>gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>23) {%Indra and Naraka1sura.%} The Asura called Naraka
<>once performed a very severe penance on the Gandha-
<>ma1dana mountain with the object of usurping Indra's
<>place. Indra was alarmed and rushed to Maha1vis2n2u
<>for help. Vis2n2u went to Gandhama1dana mountain and
<>killed Naraka1sura. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 142).
<NI>24) {%Indra and the sage Baka.%} After the war between
<>Devas and Asuras, Indra, in a peaceful state of mind,
<>was going around the world, riding on his elephant,
<>Aira1vata. When he reached an A1s4rama on the eastern
<>coast of the sea, he met the great sage Baka. A conver- [Page321-a+ 65]
<>sation about the happiness of longevity took place
<>between Indra and sage Baka who was hundred thousand
<>years old. After that Indra returned to Devaloka.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 193).
<NI>25) {%Indra and Kes4i1.%} Long ago a terrible war took place
<>between Devas and Asuras. At that time an Asura
<>called Kes4i1 attempted to abduct Devasena1, daughter of
<>a Praja1pati. Hearing her shrieks, Indra rushed to the
<>spot. In the clash between Kes4i1 and Indra, Kes4i1's club
<>was broken into two with Indra's weapon Vajra.
<>Suddenly Kes4i1 lifted a mountain and threw it at Indra.
<NI>Indra broke that mountain also into two. One part of
<>it fell on Kes4i1 himself, who fled frightened. After that,
<>Indra asked Devasena1 how she happened to fall in
<>Kes4i1's hands. Devasena1 answered thus:--“I am the
<>daughter of Praja1pati. My name is Devasena1. Kes4i1 had
<>abducted my elder sister, Daityasena1. My sister and
<>I used to come to take our bath in this Ma1nasa lake.
<>Kes4i1 had expressed his wish to abduct both of us. My
<>father has given me his blessing that a person who is
<>worshipped by gods and asuras will become my husband.
<>Having heard these facts, Indra held consultations with
<>Brahma1 and arranged the marriage between Subrah-
<>man2ya and Devasena1. See also the word “Subrah-
<>man2ya”. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 223).
<NI>26) {%Indra and An3giras.%} After killing Vr2tra1sura, Indra
<>hid himself in a lotus flower in the Ma1nasa lake, to
<>expiate for the sin of Brahmahatya1 (killing a Brahmin).
<>It was at that time that Nahus2a became Indra. After
<>Nahus2a had been forced to go back to the earth as a
<>serpent by the curse of Agastya, the Devas brought
<>back Indra. At that time, An3giras praised Indra with
<>mantras from Atharvaveda. From that day An3giras
<>got the name of ‘Atharva1n3giras’. Indra was pleased
<>and blessed An3giras that his name would become
<>famous throughout the world. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 18).
<NI>27) {%Indra and the Bow called Vijaya.%} Karn2a had a
<>bow called Vijaya. It was made by Vis4vakarma1 accor-
<>ding to Indra's liking. (M.B. Karn2a Parva, Chapter 31.
<>Verse 42).
<NI>28) {%Indra and the Tripuras.%} The Tripura1suras perform-
<>ed penance and received boons from Brahma1. After
<>that they clashed with Indra. Indra was not able to
<>kill them. The vanquished Indra had the Tripuras
<>killed by S4iva. See the word “Tripura”. (M.B. Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 33).
<NI>29) {%Indra and Su1rya (the sun-god).%} When Karn2a and
<>Arjuna came into conflict at the Bha1rata battle, a con-
<>troversy raged in heaven between Indra and Su1rya.
<>Indra argued that Arjuna would win, while Su1rya as-
<>serted that Karn2a would gain victory. The Devas joined
<>the side of Arjuna and Asuras joined Karn2a's side. In
<>the end, Arjuna came out victorious and thus Su1rya
<>was defeated by Indra. (M.B. Karn2a Parva, Chapter
<>87).
<NI>30) {%Indra and Namuci.%} The Ra1ks2asa Namuci once
<>evaded capture by Indra by remaining hidden in the
<>rays of the Sun. Indra went to him and pretending
<>friendship, promised not to kill him either with wet thing
<>or dry things or at night or in day time. Trusting his
<>words, Namuci came out. Then Indra cut off Namuci's
<>head with the froth scraped from the waves of the sea
<>at the time of dusk. The head pursued him shouting,
<>“You murderer of a friend, by breaking your promise!” [Page321-b+ 65]
<>Indra sought refuge under Brahma1. Brahma1 advised
<>him to bathe in S4on2apun2ya ti1rtha to expiate for the
<>sin. Accordingly Indra bathed in the river Sarasvati1
<>and washed off his sin.
<NI>{%River Sarasvati1.%} There is a story about how Sarasvati1
<>river became S4on2apun2ya ti1rtha. There were frequent
<>quarrels between Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra. Once
<>Vis4va1mitra got angry when he came to know that
<>Vasis2t2ha was performing a penance on the banks of the
<>river Sarasvati1. He summoned Sarasvati1 and ordered
<>her to produce Vasis2t2ha before him immediately.
<>Sarasvati1 was in a dilemma. If she brought Vasis2t2ha
<>to Vis4va1mitra, Vasis2t2ha would curse her; if on the other
<>hand, she did not bring him Vis4va1mitra would curse her.
<>At last she decided to produce Vasis2t2ha before Vis4va1mi-
<>tra. By eroding the earth on her bank little by little near
<>the place where Vasis2t2ha was performing his penance,
<>Sarasvati1 managed to bring him down into her own
<>current. Then she carried him floating down to the
<>place where Vis4va1mitra was waiting. When Vasis2t2ha
<>reached his presence, Vis4va1mitra was pleased. But
<>without allowing Vis4va1mitra to capture Vasis2t2ha she
<>took him away in her current, eastwards. Enraged
<>at this, Vis4va1mitra pronounced a curse that blood
<>should flow through the river Sarasvati1. Thus the
<>water in the river became blood-red. The great sages
<>who came there afterwards sympathised with Sarasvati1
<>in her ill-luck and as a result of their prayers S4iva
<>made her S4on2apun2yati1rtha.
<NI>It was in this river that Indra took his bath and
<>washed off his sin. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 43).
<NI>31) {%Indra and S4ruta1vati1.%} Bharadva1ja's daughter
<>S4ruta1vati1 (S4ruva1vati1) performed a very severe penance
<>to get Indra as her husband. To test her character,
<>Indra assumed the shape of Vasis2t2ha and went to
<>S4ruta1vati1. She received the guest with due reverence.
<>Pleased with her treatment, the guest handed her five
<>raw fruits and asked her to cook them for him.
<>S4ruta1vati1 gladly undertook that service. She proceeded
<>to cook the fruits but even after burning all the fuel
<>she had, the fruits were not properly cooked. So she
<>began to use her limbs one by one as fuel and burned
<>them up. Indra was deeply impressed by her self-
<>sacrifice and appearing to her in his own form married
<>S4ruta1vati1, (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 48).
<NI>32) {%Indra became S4atakratu.%} Indra performed one
<>hundred sacrifices at the place called Indrati1rtha. Thus
<>he became S4atakratu. It was there that he gave much
<>wealth to Br2haspati. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 49,
<>Verse 2).
<NI>33) {%Indra became a bird.%} Once Indra took the form of
<>a bird and went to the forest and preached moral and
<>spiritual duties to the sages who had gathered there.
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 11).
<NI>34) {%Indra and Dantideva.%} Once Dantideva received a
<>boon from Indra that he should have plenty of food
<>and enough travellers to eat it. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 29, Verses 120, 121).
<NI>35) {%Indra and Br2haspati.%} Once Br2haspati told Indra
<>that everything in the world could be achieved with
<>soothing speech. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 84, Verse
<>2).
<NI>Br2haspati's wife Ta1ra1 once fell in love with Candra
<>(the Moon god). She deserted Br2haspati and went to
<>live in Candra's residence. Br2haspati complained [Page322-a+ 65]
<>about it to Indra. Indra promised to bring her back
<>and to restore her to Br2haspati by whatever means
<>possible. Accordingly he sent a messenger to Candra.
<>Compromise talks with Candra ended in failure. So
<>preparations were started for a dreadful war between
<>Indra and Candra. S4ukra, the preceptor of Asuras
<>also joined the side of Indra. Brahma1 who came to
<>know of all this, came riding on his swan and recon-
<>ciled Indra and Candra. As directed by Brahma1,
<>Candra agreed to restore Ta1ra1 to her lawful husband,
<>Br2haspati, (Devi1 Bha1gavata, First Skandha).
<NI>36) {%Indra and Prahla1da.%} The great King Prahla1da once
<>conquered Heaven. Indra, who lost his kingdom and
<>glory, accepted Br2haspati's advice and went to meet
<>S4ukra1ca1rya. S4ukra told Indra that Prahla1da was the
<>noblest person and that he had earned that nobility by
<>his good qualities. Indra decided to acquire those good
<>qualities from Prahla1da.
<NI>Indra disguised himself as a Brahmin boy and approa-
<>ched Prahla1da with a request for moral and spiritual
<>advice. Prahla1da accepted him as his pupil and gave
<>him moral and spiritual advice. Pleased with the
<>pupil's devotion, Prahla1da agreed to give him whatever
<>boon he wanted. The pupil said that he wanted only
<>the good qualities of the Guru. Prahla1da agreed to it.
<>Then a shadow-like figure appeared to emerge from
<>Prahla1da's body. Prahla1da who was puzzled asked the
<>figure:--“Who are you” “The figure answered:--“I
<>am your virtuous character. Now I am leaving you
<>and entering this boy's body.” Saying thus it left
<>Prahla1da's body and entered Indra's body.
<>Following it, all the good qualities of Prahla1da, like
<>charity, truth, glory etc. entered Indra's body one
<>after another. It was only in the end that Prahla1da
<>came to know that the cunning pupil was Indra. Thus
<>from that day, Prahla1da began to decline in his good
<>qualities and Indra began to prosper. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 124).
<NI>37) {%Indra and Gautama.%} There is a story in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata, of how Indra restored life to a dead Brahmin.
<>Gautama was a Brahmin who had left his own home
<>and settled down to live in the village of Dasyus (an
<>aboriginal tribe). He married from a low caste and
<>followed the customs of Dasyus. At that time another
<>Brahmin happened to come there. He ridiculed
<>Gautama who had lost his caste. Next morning
<>Gautama left his residence and went to another place.
<>Tired after his long journey, he fell asleep under a
<>banyan tree. A King of birds named Na1d2i1jam3gha
<>lived on that tree. Na1d2i1jam3gha who was the son of
<>Kas4yapa, became very friendly with Gautama. He
<>brought fish from the river Gan3ga1 to feed Gautama
<>and fanned him with his wings. Gautama told the
<>bird that he was a poor Brahmin and that he was
<>anxious to get some wealth. There was a wealthy
<>Ra1ks2asa King named Viru1pa1ks2a in that country, who
<>was a close friend of Na1d2i1jam3gha. Na1d2i1jam3gha sent
<>Gautama to Viru1pa1ks2a with a request to give Gautama
<>some wealth. Viru1pa1ks2a gave plenty of gold to
<>Gautama. He returned to the foot of the banyan tree
<>carrying the gold on his head. Gautama who was
<>quite tired after his long walk, was hospitably received
<>by Na1d2i1jam3gha. That kingly bird lay asleep close by
<>Gautama. An evil desire to eat the flesh of Na1d2i1-
<>jam3gha dawned upon the mind of Gautama. He killed [Page322-b+ 66]
<>that King of birds in his sleep. Viru1pa1ks2a who came to
<>know of this, killed Gautama and gave his flesh as food
<>for Dasyus. Viru1pa1ks2a, with tears in his eyes, made a
<>funeral pyre and cremated Na1di1jam3gha's body. At that
<>time, as directed by Brahma1, Surabhi caused milk to
<>flow from heaven and revived Na1d2i1jam3gha. Viru1pa1ks2a
<>told the whole story to Indra who came there at that
<>time. Indra said that Na1d2i1jam3gha died as the result of
<>Brahma1's curse. He had offended Brahma1 on a former
<>occasion by refusing to attend Brahma1's assembly,
<>although he was invited. Na1d2i1jam3gha who was restored
<>to life, was noble enough to request Indra to bring
<>back Gautama also to life. Accordingly Indra revived
<>Gautama. Na1d2i1jam3gha returned the gold to Gautama
<>and sent him away with his good wishes. Indra returned
<>to heaven. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 173).
<NI>38) {%Indra and Ahalya1.%} Indra, once fell in love with
<>Ahalya1, the wife of Gautama. Sage Gautama who
<>came to know of it, cursed Indra. For further details,
<>see under Ahalya1.
<NI>39) {%Indra turned into a Fox.%} Once a haughty Vais4ya
<>knocked down a young sage named Kas4yapa, with his
<>chariot. The disgraced sage decided to commit suicide.
<>Knowing this Indra went to the sage in the form of a
<>fox and spoke to him, dwelling upon the evil aspects
<>of suicide. At last the young sage gave up the idea of
<>committing suicide and returned to his hermitage.
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 130).
<NI>40) {%Indra and Subrahman2ya.%} Long ago the Asuras led
<>by Ta1raka1sura, persecuted the gods in many ways.
<>Ta1raka1sura had received a boon from Brahma1 that
<>only the son born to S4iva could slay him. So, to dis-
<>tract Parames4vara from his penance, in order to make
<>it possible for him to beget a son, Indra sent Ka1madeva
<>(god of love) to him. But Ka1madeva was burnt up in
<>the fire from the third eye of S4iva. After that Pa1rvati1
<>won S4iva as her husband as a result of her austere
<>penance. She prayed to S4iva that Ka1madeva should be
<>brought back to life and that a son should be born to
<>her. S4iva replied to her:--
<NI>“Ka1ma was born from Brahma1's mind. As soon as he
<>was born, he asked Brahma1 “Kam3 Darpam?” which
<>means--whom shall I tempt and conquer?” So Brahma1
<>called him “Kandarpa”. Brahma1 had advised him
<>even at that time that he should never tempt me.
<>Disregarding that advice he came to attack me and I
<>burned him up. Now it is not possible for him to be
<>born in a physical form I shall beget of you a son
<>with my spiritual power. I do not need the urge of
<>Ka1madeva for this, as in the case of ordinary
<>mortals”.
<NI>As they were discussing this problem, Indra and Brahma1
<>arrived there. At their request S4iva agreed to beget a
<>son by Pa1rvati1. Since it is not desirable that all
<>living beings should perish, S4iva allowed Ka1madeva
<>to be born in the minds of all creatures. Brahma1 and
<>Indra returned quite happy. One day, S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1 began their amorous dalliance. They did not
<>stop it even after a hundred years. The whole world
<>began to shake to its very foundations. Fearing that
<>the world might perish, the devas, as ordered by
<>Brahma1 prayed to Agni, to interrupt the amorous play
<>of S4iva and Pa1rvati1. Agni, who understood that it was
<>not possible to achieve their object, fled and concealed
<>himself under water. The Devas went out in search
<>of Agni. By that time, the creatures in the water who [Page323-a+ 65]
<>could not bear the heat of Agni, told them the secret.
<>Then Agni deprived them of the power of speech by a
<>curse. After that he went and hid himself on the
<>Mandara mountain. Elephants and parrots disclosed
<>the secrets of Agni, who was hiding within the hollow
<>of the trunk of a tree. Agni deprived them of their
<>tongues by a curse. At last the gods discovered Agni.
<>They sent him at once to S4iva to stop him in his
<>amorous dalliance. Agni succeeded in his mission by
<>his intense heat. S4iva transferred his semen to Agni who
<>became pregnant. Being unable to bear its weight Agni
<>deposited it in the river Gan3ga1, who at the behest of
<>S4iva himself, left it in the woods on the Maha1meru
<>mountain. S4iva's attendant bhu1tas (spirits) offered
<>Pu1ja1 to it there. After a thousand years a boy with six
<>faces (Subrahman2ya) was born out of it. He was suck-
<>led by the Kr2ttika1s employed for that purpose by
<>Pa1rvati1 and the boy grew up with astonishing rapidity
<>within a few days. Having been suckled by the
<>Kr2ttika1s, the boy got the name “Ka1rttikeya”.
<NI>In those days, Devendra who was defeated by Ta1raka1-
<>sura, decided to give up war and was living in Maha1-
<>meru. The Devas and the sages used to go to Subrah-
<>man2ya for protection. When Devendra knew it, he
<>became angry and went to war with Subrahman2ya.
<>Subrahman2ya was wounded on the face with Indra's
<>weapon. From the wound two sons named S4a1kha and
<>Vis4a1kha were born to Subrahman2ya. With their help
<>Subrahman2ya encountered Indra again. At this stage
<>S4iva appeared there and informed Indra that Subrah-
<>man2ya had been born with a mission to kill Ta1raka1sura
<>and to restore Indra's kingdom to him. It was then
<>that Indra recognized Subrahman2ya. He begged pardon
<>of Subrahman2ya and expressed his desire to instal him
<>as his military commander. When he tried to perform
<>the ceremony of installation by sprinkling the holy
<>water on Subrahman2ya's head, the water refused to
<>come out of the pot. S4iva told Indra that it was
<>because he had tried to perform the installation before
<>propitiating Gan2apati. Indra then offered worship to
<>Vighnes4vara (Gan2apati) and the ceremony went off
<>without any hitch. Subrahman2ya who thus became
<>Indra's commander, killed Ta1raka1sura shortly after-
<>wards. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3baka, 6th
<>Taran3ga).
<NI>41) {%Indra and Maha1bali.%} The vanquished Maha1bali
<>who had left his home and country was in gloom
<>and despair when once Indra paid him a visit.
<>At that time Maha1laks2mi1 emerged from Maha1bali's
<>body and entered Indra's body. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 224).
<NI>42) {%Indra and Goda1na (gift of cow).%} Once Indra asked
<>Brahma1 about the efficacy of goda1na or giving a cow
<>as gift. Brahma1 told him that there is a world free from
<>the infirmities of old age and diseases and it is called
<>“Goloka”. He added that those who perform Goda1na
<>would get a place in Goloka.
<NI>43) {%Indra and a bird.%} A hunter in Ka1s4i1 once went to
<>shoot birds with poisoned arrows. One of his arrows
<>hit a big tree accidentally and the powerful poison dried
<>up the whole tree. In the hollow of the trunk of that
<>tree there lived a bird with mystic powers. It did not
<>like to leave that tree which had been its refuge
<>ever since its birth. One day Devendra, in the guise of
<>a Brahmin came to the bird, who recognized him by [Page323-b+ 65]
<>its mystic power. In the conversation between them
<>Devendra advised the bird to leave the tree and find
<>some other suitable place for its residence. The bird
<>did not accept his advice. Indra was pleased at the
<>bird's loyalty and gratitude towards that tree which
<>had been its shelter all along. So he took the bird
<>along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 5).
<NI>44) {%How Indra turned Bham3ga1s4va into a woman.%} There
<>was a King named Bham3ga1s4va. Once he performed a
<>sacrifice called “Indradvis2t2a” which was believed to
<>have the power of blessing him with children. Indra
<>being not invited was displeased with him and was wait-
<>ing for an opportunity to wreak vengeance on him.
<NI>One hundred sons were born to Bham3ga1s4va. Once he
<>went to the forest after entrusting the affairs of the
<>kingdom to his sons. Indra cunningly misguided him
<>and made him lose his way in the forest. Wandering
<>alone with his horse in the forest, he reached the bank
<>of a river. Weary and thirsty, he stepped down into the
<>river. To his amazement, he was instantly transformed
<>into a woman! The bewildered “woman” somehow
<>reached Bham3ga1s4va's palace. All the members of his
<>family were deeply grieved over his change of sex. To
<>avoid embarrassment to himself and others, Bham3ga1s4va
<>returned as a woman to the forest and there lived as
<>the wife of a sage and became the mother of a hundred
<>sons. After some years “she” went back to the palace
<>with the sons and leaving them there returned again
<>to the forest.
<NI>Indra went to the palace at this time and made the
<>two sets of hundred sons quarrel with one another
<>until all of them perished in fighting. Hearing about
<>this the mother who was in the forest, wept bitterly.
<>Indra visited her (Bham3ga1s4va) there and she told him
<>the whole story of her misfortunes and begged his
<>pardon for performing Indradvis2t2a sacrifice without
<>inviting Indra. Pleased with her repentance Indra
<>promised to resuscitate one set of her hundred sons.
<>She wanted all the hundred sons who were born when
<>she was a woman, to be restored to life. Indra was
<>ready to restore her manhood too, but she preferred
<>to continue as a woman. Indra restored to life all the
<>200 sons of Bham3ga1s4va and leaving Bham3ga1s4va as a
<>woman, returned to Devaloka. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 12).
<NI>45) {%Indra and Matam3ga.%} A story is found in the Maha1-
<>Bha1rata under the title of “Indra-Matam3ga-Sam3va1da”
<>which illustrates that a Ks2atriya, Vais4ya or S4u1dra can
<>never become a Bra1hman2a by any means. It was told
<>by Bhi1s2ma to Arjuna as follows:--
<NI>“Long ago a Bra1hman2a's wife gave birth to a boy. The
<>boy was given the name Matam3ga. His father sent him
<>in a chariot drawn by a donkey, in connection with a
<>ya1ga which he wanted to perform. Matam3ga whipped
<>the donkey mercilessly. Seeing this, the donkey's mother
<>said to Matam3ga--“You are not a Bra1hman2a.
<>Bra1hman2as cannot be so cruel. You are a Can2d2a1la (a
<>man of the lowest caste) born to your mother by a
<>barber.”
<NI>Matam3ga sadly returned to his father and after telling
<>him what he had heard from the mother-donkey set out
<>to perform an austere penance with the object of
<>becoming a Bra1hman2a. Devendra appeared to him
<>and asked him what he wanted. Matam3ga asked for a [Page324-a+ 65]
<>boon whereby he could become a Bra1hman2a; Indra
<>vanished after saying that it was impossible. After that
<>Matam3ga performed penance for hundred years,
<>standing on one foot. Indra appeared again and
<>repeated that it was impossible for Matam3ga to be-
<>come a Bra1hman2a. Then Matam3ga continued his
<>penance for a thousand years, standing on his toe.
<>Indra appeared again and transformed Matam3ga into
<>a Deva named “Chandodeva”. Indra told him that
<>though he could become a Deva, he could never
<>achieve Brahminhood. In his extreme grief Matam3ga
<>renounced his life and entered Heaven. (M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapters 27, 28 and 29).
<NI>46) {%Indra and S4am3bara.%} There is a story in the Maha1
<>Bha1rata in which an Asura named S4am3bara explained
<>the greatness of Brahminhood to Indra. Once Indra
<>approached the Asura, S4am3bara and asked him what
<>was the source of his glory and prosperity. S4am3bara
<>replied that it was all due to his whole-hearted worship
<>of Bra1hman2as. From that time Indra began to offer
<>worship to Bra1hman2as and thus he won the place of
<>Indra. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 36).
<NI>47) {%Indra loved Ruci.%} There is a story in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata of how a sage named Vipula who was born in
<>the family of Bhr2gu once saved Ruci, his Guru's wife
<>from Indra. Long ago, a great sage named Devas4arma1
<>lived in a forest. His wife Ruci being enchantingly
<>beautiful, many suitors were attracted to her. Chief
<>among them was Indra. Devas4arma1 was aware of this.
<>Once he had to leave his a1s4rama in connection with a
<>ya1ga. So he ordered his disciple Vipula to guard his
<>wife Ruci during his absence. He had given a hint to
<>Vipula that Indra who was an expert in disguises,
<>might appear in the a1s4rama in any form. Vipula, by
<>means of his mystic power entered into his guru's wife
<>and guarded her.
<NI>After some time, Indra reached the A1s4rama in the guise
<>of a handsome youth. He disclosed his real identity to
<>Ruci and told her that he had come there to spend a
<>night with her. Ruci fell in love with him. But since
<>she was under the mystic control of Vipula, Indra was
<>unable to fulfil his desire. At last Vipula sent him away
<>in disgrace. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, 44).
<NI>48) {%Indra's theft of Lotus.%} Indra once stole Agastya's
<>lotuses. (See under Agastya).
<NI>49) {%Indra's theft of an Elephant.%} Indra once stole an
<>elephant belonging to the great sage Gautama. The
<>sage complained to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who advised him to
<>offer prayers to Indra. Accordingly Gautama pleased
<>Indra by his prayers. Indra appeared and after return-
<>ing the elephant took both the elephant and Gautama
<>along with him to Devaloka. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 102).
<NI>50) {%Indra and Marutta.%} Long ago there was a famous
<>king named Marutta. Indra was closely associated with
<>him in many of his activities. (For more details see
<>Marutta).
<NI>51) {%Indra and Dharmaputra.%} Another anecdote about
<>Indra which deals with the last part of Dharmaputra's
<>life is given in the Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas, towards the end of their lives entered
<>the forest and were travelling to the north. Dharma-
<>putra who was walking in front, was followed by a dog.
<>On the way the four brothers and Pa1n5ca1ti1 fell down
<>dead. Dharmaputra continued his journey accompanied [Page324-b+ 65]
<>by the dog without turning back or looking behind. At
<>the end of the journey, Indra was waiting for him with
<>his chariot. He told Dharmaputra that his brothers and
<>wife had already taken their places in Heaven and that
<>he should leave behind the dog and get into the chariot
<>to go to Devaloka. Dharmaputra pleaded that it was
<>not right for him to enter Devaloka after deserting the
<>dog which had followed him so far. Even though Indra
<>pressed him very much to enter the chariot without the
<>dog, Dharmaputra did not yield. At last the dog assum-
<>ed the form of Yama who appeared and explained to
<>them that he had taken the form of a dog and followed
<>his son Dharmaputra to test his noble nature. They
<>were all happy and all the three of them proceeded in
<>the chariot to Devaloka. (M.B. Maha1prastha1nika
<>Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>52) {%Indra and Ba1li.%} In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a there is a
<>story as given below, about the birth of Ba1li, a son of
<>Indra:--
<NI>Arun2a, the charioteer of Su1rya (the sun-god) went one
<>night to Indraloka to see the goddesses dancing. Men
<>were not allowed to enter the dancing hall. So, Arun2a
<>managed to enter the hall by disguising himself as a
<>beautiful lady. The moment Indra saw her he fell in
<>love with her. The name she assumed at that time was
<>Arun2i1. Indra secretly took her outside and they had a
<>sexual union. Ba1li was the son born from their union.
<NI>53) {%Indra's theft of a Horse.%} A King named Sagara once
<>performed a sacrifice. Devendra stole the sacrificial
<>horse. Sagara sent all his 60,000 sons in search of the
<>horse. They dug up the earth and went to the Nether
<>worlds where they saw the horse tied in front of the
<>sage Kapila. The enraged sons of Sagara tried to
<>capture and bind the sage. But Kapila reduced all
<>the 60,000 princes to ashes by his curse. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Chapter 39).
<NI>54) {%Indra cut an embryo to pieces.%} Diti and Aditi were
<>the daughters of Daks2a. Kas4yapa married them. Indra
<>was born as the son of Aditi. At this birth of a son to
<>Aditi, Diti became jealous of her sister. One day she
<>told her husband Kas4yapa that she too wanted to have
<>a virtuous, heroic and brave son who would be equal
<>to Indra in every respect. Kas4yapa promised to grant
<>her wish.
<NI>In due course, Diti became pregnant. Now it was
<>Aditi's turn to become jealous of Diti. She could not
<>bear the thought of Diti having a son equal to her own
<>son Indra, in glory and splendour. So she called Indra
<>and secretly instructed him to destroy Diti's child in the
<>womb, by whatever means.
<NI>In obedience to his mother, Indra approached Diti
<>pretending friendship and spent a lot of time in her
<>company. He soon won her confidence and love by his
<>affectionate attentions. On one occasion, when she was
<>in sound sleep, Indra, by his mystic power, entered into
<>Diti's womb with his weapon Vajra and cut the child
<>in the womb into seven pieces. The child began to cry
<>loudly, but Indra said “Ma1 ruda” which means “do
<>not cry” and cut each of the pieces again into seven
<>parts. Thus the embryo (child) was finally cut into
<>fortynine pieces, which later became the fortynine
<>“Ma1rutas” or “Maruts”. When she woke up, Diti
<>realized Indra's treachery and in her fury she cursed
<>Indra and Aditi. She cursed that Indra would lose his
<>kingdom of Devaloka and that Aditi would be im- [Page325-a+ 65]
<>prisoned and her sons would be killed. As a result of
<>this curse Devendra lost his kingdom on one occasion.
<>Aditi, in her next birth, was born as Devaki1, wife of
<>Vasudeva and was imprisoned by Kam3sa who killed
<>her children. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Fourth Skandha).
<NI>55) {%Indra and Am3bari1s2a.%}
<NI>(1) King Am3bari1s2a had a minister named Sudeva.
<>Sudeva fell fighting in the battle-field. After some years,
<>Am3bari1s2a also died. When Am3bari1s2a arrived in Heaven,
<>he was surprised to find that Sudeva had already secured
<>a place there long ago. Ambari1s2a had performed many
<>more acts of holiness than Sudeva. Yet Sudeva attained
<>Heaven earlier than Am3bari1s2a. Am3bari1s2a asked Indra
<>why it was so. Indra answered that just as Am3bari1s2a had
<>performed many sacifices, Sudeva had performed many
<>war-sacrifices. He added that war-sacrifices were as
<>efficacious for attaining Heaven as other kinds of sacrifices
<>(M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 98).
<NI>(2) Am3bari1s2a, King of Ayodhya1 was performing a
<>sacrifice. At that time, Indra had stolen the sacrificial
<>animal. To continue the sacrifice without interruption,
<>the King decided to substitute S4unas4s4epha, the son of
<>R2ci1ka, for the cow. But S4unas4s4epha prayed to Indra
<>who came and rescued him from the jaws of death.
<>(This story is given in other Pura1n2as with slight varia-
<>tions. Va1lm2i1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, 61st Sarga).
<NI>56) {%Indra and Tris4an3ku.%} There is a story that Indra
<>once pushed down from Heaven, Tris4an3ku a King of the
<>Su1rya vam3s4a (Solar dynasty). See under TRIS4AN3KU.
<NI>57) {%Indra and Vis4va1mitra.%} Once Vis4va1mitra observed a
<>vow of silence for a period of one thousand years. At the
<>end of that period, when he was about to take his food,
<>Indra appeared in the form of a Brahmin and asked for
<>that food. Vis4va1mitra gave that food to the Brahmin
<>and resumed his austere penance. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, 65th Sarga).
<NI>58) {%Indra, S4ri1 Ra1ma and S4arabhan3ga.%}
<NI>(1). At the time when S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were
<>leading their life in the forest, one day Indra paid a visit
<>to the A1s4rama of the sage S4arabhan3ga. Devendra wished
<>to take the sage with him to Devaloka. As they were
<>talking, they saw S4ri1 Ra1ma coming to the A1s4rama. Indra
<>advised S4arabhan3ga to speak to S4ri1 Ra1ma and left the
<>place. As suggested by Indra, the sage had a conversa-
<>tion with S4ri1 Ra1ma. After it S4arabhan3ga offered his
<>body to the fire and went to Devaloka. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, 5th Sarga).
<NI>(2) When the battle between S4ri1 Ra1ma and Ra1van2a
<>was in progress, Indra presented to S4ri1 Ra1ma, an
<>excellent chariot along with the horses. The chariot and
<>horses were handed over to S4ri1 Ra1ma on the battlefield
<>by Ma1tali; Indra's charioteer. S4ri1 Ra1ma fought against
<>Ra1van2a from that chariot and slew him. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 103).
<NI>(3) After the war with Ra1van2a, Indra appeared before
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma and asked him what boon he wanted. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma replied that all those monkeys who died in the
<>war should come back to life and the forests in which
<>they lived should abound in fruits and flowers in all the
<>seasons of the year. Indra restored all those monkeys to
<>life and made all the forests in which they lived, green
<>and rich with luxuriant vegetation. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 129).
<NI>59) {%Indra gives his sword for safe-custody.%} During their life
<>in the forest S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, accompanied by [Page325-b+ 65]
<>Si1ta1 entered Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. S4ri1 Ra1ma's chief object in
<>going there was to give protection to the sages and their
<>hermitages in the forest. But seeing that he had made the
<>killing of Ra1ks2asas his main purpose, Si1ta1 told him that
<>this change in the objective would spoil other important
<>matters. To illustrate this she told him the following
<>story:--
<NI>‘Once upon a time, a great sage was observing holy
<>rites with great austerity. Indra was alarmed at it. He
<>went to the sage's hermitage in the form of a warrior
<>armed with a sword. Indra handed over his sword to
<>the sage for safe custody. The sage accepted it and
<>from that time all his attention was concentrated on
<>the sword. All his time was spent in guarding the
<>sword and he began to neglect his devotional duties
<>as a sage. As a result of it his mystic power declined
<>and ultimately he fell into Hell. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, 9th Sarga).
<NI>60) {%Indra and Kabandha.%} See under Kabandha.
<NI>61) {%The Post or Office of Indra.%} Indra was anointed as
<>King of Devas on Meghava1n mountain. In the 42nd
<>Sarga of Kis2kindha1 ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a we
<>find that Sugri1va had ordered the monkeys to search
<>for Si1ta1 on that mountain also.
<NI>62) {%Indra and Maya.%} Maya, the carpenter of the
<>Asuras, performed penance to Brahma1 and acquired
<>complete mastery in the science of carpentry and
<>architecture. After that he constructed a forest mansion
<>of golden colour and took up his residence in it. Once
<>Maya set his eyes on a goddess named Hema1. When
<>Indra knew this he became angry and killed Maya
<>with his weapon--Vajra. From that time Hema1 got
<>Maya's golden mansion. This was told by Hema1's
<>maid, Svayam3prabha1 to Hanu1ma1n. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, 51st Sarga).
<NI>63). {%Indra cut off the wings of Mountains.%} In Kr2tayuga
<>all the Mountains in the world had wings. They used
<>to fly about here and there like Garud2a with the
<>speed of wind. The sages and the Devas feared that
<>they might fall on their heads. The Devas held a con-
<>ference and elected Indra to find a remedy for this.
<>Indra cut off the wings of the mountains with his Vajra.
<>The Maina1ka mountain was a friend of wind. When
<>Indra was about to cut off the wings of that mountain,
<>Wind suddenly removed it and deposited it in the
<>ocean. It is out of his gratitude for this that the
<>Maina1ka mountain rose up from the ocean and pro-
<>vided a resting place for Hanu1ma1n, the son of Wind
<>god, when he jumped to Lan3ka1. This story was told
<>by Maina1ka mountain to Hanu1ma1n. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-

<NI>64) {%Indra cut off his preceptor's head%} Once Devendra
<>accepted a sage named Vis4varu1pa as his preceptor for
<>a sacrifice. Vis4varu1pa's mother was a Da1nava partisan.
<>So this priest, as directed by his mother, performed
<>the sacrifice with the prayer--“May the gods and the
<>Asuras prosper.” As a result of the prayer, both the
<>gods who performed the sacrifice and the Asuras
<>who did not perform it, prospered. At this Devendra

<NI>65) {%Indra and Mahis2a1sura.%} See under Mahis2a1sura.
<NI>66) {%Indra became a bull.%} Long ago there was a King
<>called Kakutstha in the Iks2va1ku dynasty. When he was
<>ruling over the kingdom of Ayodhya1, a war broke [Page326-a+ 64]
<>out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, the Devas
<>were not able to defeat the Asuras. Indra in distress
<>approached Vis2n2u for refuge. Vis2n2u advised him to
<>seek the help of Kakutstha, King of Ayodhya1. So Indra
<>with the other gods went to Ayodhya1. When Kakutstha
<>heard about their appeal for help, he glady offered
<>his help but only on condition that Indra became his
<>vehicle. Seeing no other way, Indra assumed the
<>form of a bull and Kakutstha, riding on the back of
<>the bull fought against the Asuras and defeated them.
<>It is from that day that the King came to be called
<>“Kakutstha”, “Indra-va1hana” and “Puran5jaya”. (His
<>original name is unknown). “Kakut” means the “hamp
<>of a bull”. Because he was seated on the “Kakut” he
<>got the name “Kakutstha”. Because he made Indra
<>“va1hana” (vehicle) he got the name of “Indrava1hana”.
<>As he defeated the Asuras and conquered their city
<>(pura) he was called “Puran5jaya”. Kakutstha was the
<>son of S4as4a1da and the father of Pr2thu. S4ri1 Ra1ma is
<>called “Ka1kutstha” because he was born in the
<>family of Kakutstha. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>67) {%Indra's Task.%} Devi1 Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha says
<>that Indra is one of the “As2t2adikpa1lakas (the eight
<>protectors of the quarters) and the name of his city
<>is “Amara1vati1”.
<NI>68). {%Indra's term of Life.%} The Devi1 Bha1gavata 5th
<>Skandha says that two life-spans of Brahma1 make
<>Vis2n2u's life-span. S4iva has double the life-span of
<>Vis2n2u, that during the life of Brahma1, fourteen
<>Indras will drop down from Heaven and perish, and
<>one day of Brahma1 is made up of one thousand
<>“Caturyugas.”
<NI>There are fourteen Manvantaras during the life of the
<>present Brahma1 (See under Manvantara). This means
<>that fourteen Manus will be born and will die one
<>after another during this period. Each Manvantara will
<>have its own Indra and the Devas. The first Manu was
<>Sva1yambhuva. After him five more Manus, Sva1rocis2a,
<>Uttama, Ta1masa, Raivata and Ca1ks2us2a, have passed
<>away. The present Manu is Vaivasvata the son of

<NI>70) {%The name Purandara.%} Sardar K.M. Panikkar
<>in his preface to R2gveda Sam3hita1 says that Indra
<>got the name Purandara because he destroyed the

<>Va1mana Pura1n2a, we are told that he got this name
<>because he killed “Pura”, the son of Maha1bali.
<NI>71) {%Indra in the land of Kon3kan2a.%} Once an Asura named
<>S4u1rapadma obtained from Brahma1, a boon to enable
<>him to conquer the whole world. He persecuted the

<>to bring Indra1n2i1 (Indra's wife) to him as a captive.
<>Indra, who came to know of this, secretly went away
<>with Indra1n2i1 to the Kon3kan2a land and lived in a
<>temple there. After some days, entrusting Indra1n2i1 to
<>the protection of S4a1sta1, he went to Kaila1sa. Just at this

<>what boon he wanted. Mucukunda asked for a boon
<>which would give him long and sound sleep. Indra
<>granted it and in addition declared that anyone who
<>disturbed Mucukunda's sleep would be reduced to
<>ashes. After that Mucukunda went to sleep in a cave
<>in the middle of a dense forest.
<NI>A King of the tribe Yavana performed penance to
<>Brahma1 and obtained his boon which would enable
<>him to defeat the Ya1davas (S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's clan) and
<>he began to fight with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Because of
<>Brahma1's boon, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was not able to kill him.
<>He drove Yavana into the cave in which Mucukunda
<>was sleeping. Mucukunda suddenly woke up from his
<>sleep and looked at him with great anger. Yavana
<>was at once reduced to ashes. (Bha1gavata, 10th

<>with Indra. So they approached Dadhyan3 to acquire
<>that Knowledge. But he refused to teach them due to
<>his fear that Indra would cut off his head. So the
<>As4vini1s cut off Dadhyan3's head and fixed a horse's
<>head in its place. With that horse-head Dadhyan3
<>taught the As4vini1s Madhu Vidya1. After they had learnt

<NI>84) {%Indra and Meghana1da.%} Ra1van2a conquered the
<>world with the help of Brahma1's blessing. In his pride
<>he came into conflict with Indra. After a fierce battle,
<>Ra1van2a's son, Meghana1da defeated Indra. He took
<>Indra to Lan3ka1 as a prisoner. Ra1van2a chained I1ndra's
<>hands and feet and tied him to his flagstaff. The Devas
<>in distress approached Brahma1 for help. Brahma1 went
<>to Lan3ka1 and secured the release of Indra. After giving
<>the title of Indrajit to Meghana1da, Brahma1 returned to
<>Brahmaloka.
<NI>Sometime before this Devendra had committed adultery
<>with Ahalya1, Sage Gautama's wife. At that time
<>Gautama had uttered a curse on him, that he would
<>have to spend a year in prison, chained by an enemy.
<>His life in Ra1van2a's prison in Lan3ka1 was in fulfilment
<>of that curse. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>85) {%Indra and Hanu1ma1n.%} Hanu1ma1n, the son of Va1yu
<>(wind) sprang up into the sky as soon as he was born,
<>seeing the brilliant rising sun, and mistaking it to be
<>some delicious food. He saw Ra1hu who was standing
<>near the sun and made a leap towards him. When
<>he came near, he saw Aira1vata, Indra's elephant,
<>standing in Devaloka. At once he turned towards that
<>elephant to swallow him. Seeing the struggle between
<>Hanu1ma1n and Aira1vata Indra used his weapon Vajra
<>which cut the monkey's “hanu” (jaw bone) and he fell [Page327-b+ 65]
<>down dead on the earth. Va1yu, in deep sorrow, took
<>the dead body of his son and went to Pa1ta1la. When
<>Va1yu (wind) left the world, the creatures of the world
<>underwent great suffering. Then the Devas led by
<>Brahma1 went to Pa1ta1la, consoled Va1yu and revived
<>Hanu1ma1n. Since his “Hanu” was cut with Vajra, the
<>monkey was named “Hanu1ma1n” by Indra. Besides,
<>Indra gave him a blessing that Hanu1ma1n would die
<>only when he wished. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a; Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a; 66th Sarga).

<NI>87) {%Indra becomes victim of old age.%} Once the sage
<>Durva1sas went to Devaloka. The goddesses gave him a
<>grand reception at which Menaka1 presented him with
<>a garland made of fragrant flowers. The sage gave it to
<>Devendra. Indra placed it on Aira1vata's tusk. The
<>fragrance of the garland attracted a large number of
<>bees to it. They swarmed round the head of the ele-
<>phant and annoyed it. Aira1vata picked up the garland
<>trampled it under his foot, pulled it to pieces and threw
<>it away. Durva1sas took this as an insult to himself and
<>pronounced a curse that all the gods would be subject-
<>ed to wrinkles and grey hair of old age.
<NI>Indra and the other gods fell victims to old age. Indra
<>requested Durva1sas to release him from his curse. The
<>sage relented and told him that if the Devas drank
<>Amr2ta obtained by churning the ocean of milk they
<>would recover their youth. Accordingly, the ocean of
<>milk was churned by the joint effort of the Devas and
<>Asuras and in the end the Devas snatched it away.
<>When the Devas drank Amr2ta, the symptoms of old age
<>disappeared and they recovered their youth. (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yana).
<NI>88) {%Indra and Dan2d2aka1ran2ya.%} Dan2d2a the son of Iks2va1ku,
<>a King of the Solar dynasty, ruled over the territory
<>between the Vindhya and the Hima1layas. Once when
<>he was out ahunting in the neighbourhood of the moun-
<>tains, he saw a charming woman. She was “Ara1”, the
<>daughter of the sage S4ukra. The King was fascinated
<>by her beauty and fell desperately in love with her at
<>the very first sight. He seized her by force and commi-
<>tted rape on her. When S4ukra knew about this, he was
<>furious and uttered a curse that Indra should shower
<>a rain of fire on Dan2d2a's kingdom. Thus the whole
<>country of Dan2d2a was destroyed by Indra's rain of fire.
<>In course of time that region was turned into a dense
<>forest and came to be called “Dan2d2aka1ran2ya”. (Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).

<NI>90) {%Indra's Divinity.%} In the earliest stage of Hinduism,
<>Indra had occupied one of the most eminent places
<>among the gods. Maha1vis2n2u had only the place of
<>younger brother of Indra at that time. In Amara Kos4a
<>we find “Upendra Indra1varaja” as the synonym of [Page328-a+ 65]
<>Vis2n2u. In R2gveda Indra has a more important place.
<>Although Rudra is a divinity or deity and although
<>there are references to Kapardin, there is not even a
<>single stuti (praise) about S4iva in the R2gveda. R2g-
<>veda does not recognize Devi1pu1ja1 and idol worship.
<>But in the Pura1n2ic age, Indra was transformed into a
<>lascivious “Deva Prabhu” (Lord among the gods).
<>Sardar K.M. Panikkar, in his preface to “R2gveda
<>Sam3hita1” says about Indra:--“The main actor in R2g-
<>veda is Indra. In the war against the Dasyus the A1ryas
<>seek the help chiefly of Indra. Indra is represented as
<>very handsome and of a golden complexion. His weapon
<>is Vajra, thunderbolt which was made by Tvas2t2a1.
<>Va1yu (wind) is his charioteer. He is constantly travel-
<>ling about in the sky driving in his golden chariot. Indra
<>likes drinking Soma juice more than the other gods.
<>Indra is even referred to as “Somapa”. He is also
<>sometimes described as the twin brother of Agni. Sages
<>have sung unendingly about the exploits of Indra.
<>Hiran2yastu1pa, a sage, has composed a work entitled
<>“Indrastuti” which celebrates many of the heroic deeds
<>of Indra. Indra was Vajrapa1n2i who had slain the Asuras
<>like Ahi, Tus2n2a, S4am3bara, Vala, Vr2tra and others.
<NI>There are also several stories in the Vedas about the
<>birth of this hero. At the time of Indra's birth, some-
<>how, his mother felt that he was incapable of being
<>killed. So she decided to abandon him. Fearing trouble
<>for herself, she asked the child to leave her and go to
<>some other place. Indra refused to do so and followed
<>her to the house of Tvas2t2a1. There he drank the juice
<>of the soma plant and gained strength to kill his ene-
<>mies. But unaware of this, his mother, tried to keep
<>him concealed. Indra, however, came out of the place
<>in his dazzling attire and encountered the enemies.
<>Vr2tra who met Indra got ready for a fight. In the fight
<>Vyam3sa struck down Indra. The devas fled in fear.
<>Indra who was left alone called upon Vis2n2u and sought
<>his aid.
<NI>Although Indra needed help in his fight with Vr2tra, he
<>was the chief support to the A1rynas in their fight against
<>the Dasyus. It was Indra's Vajra which broke up the for-
<>tresses of many Dasyu kings. That was why he got the
<>name “Purandara”. Once Indra dried up the whole
<>river to enable his army to cross it for the sake of Sud-
<>a1s. When Sus4ravas became helpless, Indra destroyed
<>twenty kings and 60099 soldiers with his chariot wheel.
<>Thus we see Indra in the R2gveda as the destroyer of
<>the Dasyus and the protector of A1ryans.”
<NI>Indra1n2i1, S4aci1 and Pulomaja1 are the names of Indra's
<>wife. Indra's son, Jayanta is also known by the name
<>of Pa1kas4a1sani. Indra's city is Amara1vati1; his chariot
<>“Vima1na”, his charioteer Ma1tali, and his garden Nan-
<>danavana. “Vaijayanta” is the name of his mansion.
<>Indra's weapon has several other names, such as, Hra1-
<>dini1, Kulis4a, Bhidura, Pavi, S4atakot2i, Svaru, S4a1mba,
<>Dambholi, As4ani etc. Indra's assembly is called “Su-
<>dharma1”. Indra's bow is the rainbow, his sword is
<>Paran5jaya and his residence is Heaven. The trees in
<>Heaven are, Manda1ra, Pa1rija1ta, Santa1na, Kalpavr2ks2a
<>and Haricandana. The festival celebrated in honour of
<>Indra is called “S4akradhvajottha1na” or “Indrotsava”.

<>Devas who knew that Maha1s4ani was a relative of
<>Varun2a, sought the help of Varun2a. At the instance. of
<>Varun2a, Indra was released. The revengeful
<>Indra prayed to S4iva. S4iva appeared and asked Indra
<>to submit his complaint to Vis2n2u. Indra offered his
<>prayers to Vis2n2u. As a result of it, a man who had the

<>Sumati--Indradyumna.
<NI>2) {%Indradyumna turned into elephant.%} Indradyumna, a
<>devottee of Vis2n2u handed over governance of the country
<>to his children when he became old, and performed
<>penance in the Malaya mountain. One day, when he
<>was immersed in meditation Agastya came there. Natu-
<>rally, Indradyumna did not notice Agastya's arrival.
<>Enraged at this the latter cursed Indradyumna and
<>turned him into an elephant. Being told immediately
<>about the curse by his servants Indradyumna sought
<>redemption from the curse from Agastya himself. Redemp-
<>tion was granted thus: Indradyumna would roam in
<>the forest for years as an elephant, a devotee of Vis2n2u
<>and he would attain salvation when Lord Vis2n2u came
<>down to the earth and patted the elephant on its back.
<>Accordingly Indradyumna who was turned into an ele-
<>phant roamed about in the forest for many years in the
<>company of a herd of wild elephants. At last it arrived
<>at Mount Triku1t2a. There was a lake there on the banks
<>of which was sage Devala engaged in penance. Hu1hu1,
<>the Gandharva had once come to this lake with a num-
<>ber of Apsara1 women and they indulged in amorous
<>sports, which Devala did not like. He cursed Hu1hu1 and
<>turned him into a crocodile, and the crocodile lived in
<>the same lake.
<NI>Indradyumna who was turned into an elephant, stepped
<>into the lake to drink water when the crocodile caught
<>hold of its hind leg. Neither did the elephant yield nor [Page329-a+ 65]
<>the crocodile leave the former free. Their tug of war
<>continued for 1000 years when Maha1vis2n2u appeared
<>on the scene, killed the crocodile and saved the
<>elephant. At once the elephant was re-transformed
<>into Indradyumna and he attained Vaikun2t2ha (the
<>abode of Vis2n2u). (Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha).
<NI>A Malayalam verse summarises the above story as
<>follows:--Impelled by Agastya's curse the elephant
<>went to the lake at Mount Triku1t2a, and suffered for
<>1000 years as the crocodile which caught hold of its
<>hind leg did not loosen its grip. Then appeared on the
<>scene the killer of Mura1sura (Lord Vis2n2u) on his
<>vehicle, Garud2a, killed the crocodile with his discus
<>and granted salvation to the elephant.
<NI>3) {%Indradyumna's fall from heaven when the merits of his good
<>deeds were exhausted.%} The merits or the result of his
<>good and noble deeds having been exhausted, Indra-
<>dyumna, the saintly king once descended from heaven
<>to earth, and the sad King approached sage Ma1rkan2-
<>d2eya. But, the sage did not recognize him. The King
<>and the sage went to Pra1vi1rakarn2a, an owl living on
<>the top of the Hima1layas. It also did not recognise the
<>King. Then they went to Na1d2i1jam3gha, a stork very
<>much older than the owl and living in the lake known
<>as Indradyumna. Na1d2i1jam3gha also could not recognise
<>the King. In another part of the lake was living a
<>tortoise called Aku1pa1ra, who was older than Na1d2i1-
<>jam3gha. At last the King, the sage, Pra1vi1rakarn2a and
<>Na1d2i1jam3gha approached Aku1pa1ra. At his very sight
<>Aku1pa1ra recognized the King. Aku1pa1ra told sage
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya that Indradyumna was a very famous
<>King and quite liberal and munificent in distributing
<>gifts, and that the lake Indradyumna was formed by
<>the passage of the cows gifted by the King. Having
<>heard these details regarding the King the sage sent
<>him back to heaven. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 199).
<HI>INDRADYUMNA II. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,

<HI>INDRADYUMNA V. A king of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<>(See Para 2, under Vis4vakarman).
<HI>INDRADYUMNA VI. A king who lived in the Kr2ta
<>yuga, and a devotee of Vis2n2u. He visited the Jagan-
<>na1tha temple in Od2ra Des4a once to worship Lord
<>Jaganna1tha. The Lord was then hidden in the sand.
<>When the King, disappointed at this was about to
<>return, determined to fast unto death at Mount Ni1la
<>when a celestial voice cried, “Thou shalt see Him”.
<>Afterwards the King performed a horse sacrifice and
<>built a magnificent Vis2n2u temple. Narasim3hamu1rti
<>brought by Na1rada was installed in the temple.
<>During sleep the King had a dars4ana (sight) of Lord
<>Jaganna1tha. Also an astral voice directed him to cut
<>down the fragrant tree on the seashore and make
<>idols with it. Accordingly the king got idols of
<>Vis2n2u, Balara1ma, Sudars4ana and Subhadra1 made and
<>installed them in the temple. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>INDRADYUMNA(M). A lake. A stork called Na1d2i1-
<>jam3gha and the A1diku1rma called Aku1pa1ra lived in this [Page329-b+ 65]
<>lake. It came into existence when the cows given in gift
<>by King Indradyumna passed along that way. (M.B.
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 198). The pool lay near
<>Mount Gandhama1dana, and the Pa1n2d2avas once visit-

<HI>INDRAJIT. Ra1van2a's son, Meghana1da.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Vis2n2u,--

<>(Indrajit).
<NI>To Pulastya, one of the Praja1patis was born by

<>was his son by Ilibila1 and Ra1van2a, Kumbhakarn2a,
<>Vibhi1s2an2a and S4u1rpan2akha1 (daughter) being the
<>offsprings of Kaikasi1. Ra1van2a married Mandodari1 and

<>went to Mount Kaila1sa to offer salutations to Lord

<>and Madhura1 used the opportunity to please the
<>Lord, and she got pregnant by him. All on a sudden
<>Pa1rvati1 appeared on the scene, and knowing what
<>had happened in her absence she cursed Madhura1 to
<>fall into an abandoned well as a frog. Madhura1
<>prayed for redemption from the curs4e, and S4iva pity-
<>ing her sad plight blessed her that after 12 years she
<>would get herself transformed into a fair damsel and
<>become the daughter of Maya and would, then, be
<>married by a great King. According to Pa1rvati1's curse
<>Madhura1 fell into a well in the forest as a frog. Maya1-
<>sura was performing penance near the well to get a
<>daughter. On the expiry of 12 years after Madhura1
<>fell into the well as a frog, Maya1sura looked into it
<>and beheld a beautiful girl. He took her to his palace
<>named her Mandodari1 and brought her up as his own
<>daughter. Ra1van2a married her. It was at this stage
<>that S4iva's vital fluid which had, twelve years before,
<>entered her womb made its appearance in the form
<>of a son. Ra1van2a named him Meghana1da. Being S4iva's
<>son he grew up with great prowess. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>over, Ra1van2a returned to Lan3ka1 and sage S4ukra
<>gave him details about the yajn5as conducted by his

<>ya1ga performed by his son, and S4ukra, who got angry
<>at this cursed, Ra1van2a that he would meet with his
<>death at the hands of Vis2n2u. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>By performing a S4aiva ya1ga, Meghana1da got the bless-

<>art of Sama1dhi, which helped one to move amongst
<>others invisible to them. [Page330-a+ 63]
<NI>4) {%The name, Indrajit.%} Once Ra1van2a encircled Indra-
<>loka with a big army, and Indra, very much alarmed
<>ran up to Vis2n2u for protection. Vis2n2u told Indra that
<>it was not yet time for Ra1van2a's death and when it
<>was time Vis2n2u himself would slay him. Disappointed
<>at this Indra returned, and a fierce war ensued between
<>him and Ra1van2a. Indra fought with Ra1van2a, and
<>Jayanta, his son fought with Meghana1da. When fight-
<>ing reached its climax Meghana1da resorted to the
<>art of Sama1dhi taught by S4iva, and became invisible
<>to others. Then he showered his arrows. Jayanta
<>fainted on the battlefield. Puloma1, father of Indra1n2i1,
<>carried away Jayanta without others knowing and
<>concealed him in the ocean. Everyone thought that
<>Jayanta was dead. Burning with grief and revenge
<>Indra confronted Ra1van2a again. Ra1van2a fell down at
<>the blow with Indra's vajra (thunderbolt). Then once
<>more making himself invisible to others, Meghana1da
<>jumped into Indra's chariot and bound him prisoner.
<>By that time Ra1van2a got up on his feet, and he and
<>Meghana1da carried away Indra to Lan3ka1 and chained
<>him to the foot of the flagstaff.
<NI>The Devas, grief-stricken at this sad fate of Indra
<>went to Brahma1 and submitted their grievance.
<>Brahma1 reached Lan3ka1, and named Meghana1da Indra-
<>jit. (He who gained victory over Indra). Indrajit
<>prayed to Brahma1 for the boon, which would ward
<>off death for ever. When Brahma1 told him that the
<>boon of eternal deathlessness was out of the question
<>he sought the following boon: that when he had per-
<>formed a yajn5a, out of the sacrificial fire should emerge
<>a chariot and necessary horses and that he should not
<>be killed by any one while fighting from that chariot,
<>and that he did not mind being killed by enemies if
<>he got away without completing the yajn5a. Brahma1

<>become S4u1rapadma's wife. Indra1n2i1 refused. Ultimately
<>Indra returned and took Indra1n2i1 back to Devaloka.
<NI>3) {%Indra1n2i1 and Nahus2a.%} See under Agastya.
<NI>4) {%Indra1n2i1 and Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Maha1bha1rata says that Pa1n5ca1li1
<>was a partial incarnation of Indra1n2i1. (See under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<>A part of S4aci1 was born in the family of Drupada as
<>Draupadi1, viz. Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67).
<NI>(1) Indra1n2i1 once went to the assembly of Brahma1 and
<>worshipped him. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Verse 42).
<NI>(2) When once Satyabha1ma1 came to Devaloka with
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Indra1n2i1 conducted her to Aditi, mother of the
<>Devas. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 36).
<NI>(3) S4aci1 also was present at the birth of Subrah-
<>man2ya. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 13).
<NI>(4) Indra1n2i1 and Arjuna. (See under Arjuna).
<HI>INDRAPARVATA. A mountain in Videha. (M.B. Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 30, Verse 15).
<HI>INDRAPRAMATI. A disciple of Paila. He belonged
<>to the line of Vya1sa's disciples. For other details see
<>under Vya1sa.
<HI>INDRAPRASTHA. Capital city of the Pa1n2d2avas. It is
<>the same as Delhi, the capital of modern India.
<NI>1) {%Construction.%} As ordained by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Dharma-
<>putra, claimant to half of the kingdom, went to the
<>forest Kha1n2d2avaprastha with his brothers. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>stood by them; great sages like Vya1sa helped them.
<>There, in the forest, they built a city called Indraprastha
<>as beautiful as Indraloka. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>211).
<NI>2) {%Reconstruction.%} Once Agni burned down the Kha1n2-
<>d2ava forest. (See under Kha1n2d2avada1ha). Arjuna saved
<>Maya and five others from the fire. Maya asked Arjuna
<>what he should do in return for saving his life. Arjuna
<>replied that it was not proper to expect any reward for
<>saving one's life and that, if Maya was very keen about
<>doing something in return, it might be done for Kr2s2n2a.
<>Then Kr2s2n2a asked Maya to build for the Pa1n2d2avas a
<>palace, the most beautiful one in the world at Indrapra-
<>stha. And, accordingly, after getting the Brahmins
<>duly feasted, Maya marked the ground ten thousand [Page331-a+ 63]
<>Kis2kus
<F>1) Kis2ku means a cubit. “Kis2kur haste” (Amara).</F> in extent. Then Maya went to the mountain
<>Maina1ka to the west of Mount Kaila1sa, where
<>in the pool called Bindu he had stored a large quantity
<>of gold and gems. Maya brought those materials as
<>also a conch called Devadatta from there and built the
<>most beautiful palace in the world at Indraprastha.
<>Within the palace were made many a beautiful pool and
<>various patterns with galleries etc. in glass. It was built
<>so beautifully and in such a manner as to create, at the
<>very sight, the illusion that there was water where there
<>was really no water and vice versa. It took fourteen mon-
<>ths to complete the construction of that most beautiful
<>model of architecture. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapters
<>1-3).
<NI>3) Vajra, son of Aniruddha of the Ya1dava dynasty
<>was made master of Indraprastha after the time of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B. Mausala Parva, Chapter 7, Verse
<>11).
<HI>INDRAPU1JA1. This pu1ja1 (Indra-worship) is also
<>called Indrotsava. It was during the reign of Vasu,
<>a king of the lunar dynasty that Indrotsava began
<>being celebrated in an organised manner. Pleased at
<>the long penance of Vasu, Indra appeared to him and
<>presented a Ven2udan2d2a. Vasu planted the dan2d2a on
<>earth and conducted Indrapu1ja1. Thenceforward raising
<>the Ven2udan2d2a became the first item in celebrating
<>Indrotsava. The staff is decorated with flowers, sandal,
<>garlands etc. To the top of the staff is attached the
<>form of a Ham3sa and offerings are given to it. The
<>reason for this is the fact that it was in the form of a
<>Ham3sa that Indra appeared to Vasu. Pleased by the
<>Indrapu1ja1 of Vasu, Indra announced as follows:--If
<>men, and especially kings worship me in the manner
<>done by Vasu, prosperity and welfare will accrue to
<>them and to their kingdoms. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>63).
<HI>INDRAS2ENA I. A son of King Nala. (M.B. Vana

<NI>When the Pa1n2d2avas arrived at Mount Gandhama1dana
<>they left Indrasena with Suba1hu, the Pulinda King.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 140, Verse 27). After

<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 58). Indrasena was
<>present at the wedding of Abhimanyu which was

<>the King. The King lost all mental peace at this and
<>sought the advice of many sages for redemption from
<>the sin, and Indrota (S4aunaka) advised him to go on a
<>pilgrimage and perform righteous duties (dharma).
<>The King acted accordingly and got rid of the sin of
<>killing the brahmin. This story occurs under the title
<>Indrotapa1riks2iti1yam in S4a1nti Parva in three chapters.

<HI>IRA1VA1N. A son born to Arjuna of the serpent damsel
<>(Na1gakanya1) named Ulu1pi1. (For genealogy see under
<>Arjuna).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} According to the practice laid down Pa1n5ca1li1
<>used to live with each husband for one year by turn.
<>When she was living with one husband the other four
<>husbands had no admission there. When once Arjuna
<>wanted his arms to redeem the cows of a brahmin
<>stolen by thieves he entered the apartment of Dharma-
<>putra where the arms had been kept and took them.
<>For thus having entered, against rules, the apartment
<>then kept by Dharmaputra and Pa1n5ca1li1, Arjuna had to [Page332-a+ 65]
<>go on a pilgrimage for one year. Numerous brahmins
<>accompanied Arjuna and while spending the night on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1, Arjuna entered its waters for
<>bathing. There he saw the Na1ga damsel, Ulu1pi1. They
<>fell in love with each other and got married. And, a
<>son named Ira1va1n was born to them. Ulu1pi1 granted
<>Arjuna the boon that all water-animals would obey
<>him and that in water he would be invincible. Leaving
<>Ulu1pi1 and Ira1va1n behind, Arjuna continued his stay in
<>the forest.
<NI>2) {%Further Information.%} (1) In the great war Ira1va1n
<>fought on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas. During the first

<HI>IRIMPU. A Malayalam word meaning ‘iron’. The
<>metal iron originated in the following way. The Devas
<>sought Brahma1's protection against the onslaughts of
<>Ta1raka1sura, who had obtained a boon to the effect that
<>he could be killed only by a son born to S4iva. And,
<>implored by Brahma1 and others S4iva entered into the
<>sex act with Pa1rvati1. The impact shook the universe.
<>Agni separated them from the process and the semen of
<>S4iva dropped in Agni. Agni deposited it in the Gan3ga1.
<>The Gan3ga1 could not bear it and it coursed through
<>her (Gan3ga1's) arteries and out of it was born Subrah-
<>man2ya. Also from the particles of the semen gold and
<>silver were produced. From the intensity of the heat
<>were produced iron and copper. See under Subrah-
<>man2ya. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Canto 37).

<NI>(From this primordial principle the five elements

<>gave rise to the sense of touch and so air is called
<>spars4aru1pa. This va1yu again gave rise to Agni (Va1yo-

<>sense of taste (rasaru1pa). From water came earth which
<>is gandharu1pa (the source of smell) (Udaka1dbhu1mih2).

<>Jalam3 (water) has four gun2as--s4abda, spars4a, ru1pa, and

<HI>JA1BA1LA1. The mother of the hermit Satyaka1ma. (For
<>details see under Satyaka1ma).
<HI>JA1BA1LI I. A famous hermit. In Maha1bha1rata, Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 55, it is stated that
<>Ja1ba1li was one of the sons of Vis4va1mitra. They
<>were expounders of the Vedas. Though he was the son
<>of Vis4va1mitra his life was mostly connected with Va-
<>sis2t2ha. The Pura1n2as do not make it clear how this son
<>of Vis4va1mitra happened to fall into the circle of Vasi-
<>s2t2ha who was a foe of Vis4va1mitra. He was one of the
<>seven spiritual advisers of King Das4aratha. It is men-
<>tioned in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 48 that
<>eight hermits such as Suyajn5a, Va1madeva, Ja1ba1li,
<>Kas4yapa Vasis2t2ha and others lived in Ayodhya1 in the
<>palace of the King Das4aratha.
<NI>When Bharata went to the forest, to bring S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>back to Ayodhya1, Ja1ba1li also followed him. Ja1ba1li
<>argued with S4ri1 Ra1ma, using several arguments, to make
<>him return to Ayodhya1. These arguments made S4ri1
<>Ra1ma angry. But he was pacified by the consoling words
<>of Vasis2t2ha. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>Ja1ba1li comes in the line of disciples of Vya1sa. Vya1sa
<>divided the Veda and taught Sumantu Atharvaveda.
<>The hermit Sumantu first taught Atharvaveda to his
<>disciple Kabandha who divided it into two parts and
<>taught two disciples Devadars4a, and Pathya. The disci- [Page335-b+ 65]
<>ples of Devadars4a were Magadha, Brahmabali, Saut-
<>ka1yani and Pippala1da. Pathya had three disciples.
<>They were Ja1ba1li, Kumuda and S4aunaka. Of these
<>Ja1ba1li was a famous expounder of Atharvaveda. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3).
<HI>JA1BA1LI II. Son of R2tadhvaja, a hermit. (See under
<>Vis4vakarma1, Para 2).
<HI>JA1BA1LI III. A hermit. The descendants of this hermit
<>also are known by this name. Ja1ba1li who performed
<>penance on the mountain of Mandara had several disci-
<>ples.
<NI>While Ja1ba1li was going along the forest he saw a young
<>man of handsome appearance {??}gaged in penance on
<>the shore of a lake. Ja1ba1li wanted to know about him
<>and his penance. But as the young man was in deep
<>meditation Ja1ba1li had to wait there for several years.
<>At last the young man awoke from his meditation and
<>told Ja1ba1li the secrets of devotional meditation and con-
<>templation of Kr2s2n2a. The remaining life of Ja1ba1li was
<>spent in the worship of Kr2s2n2a, in consequence of which
<>in the next birth he was reborn as a cowherdess,
<>named Citragandha1 in the house of the cowherd Pra-
<>can2d2a. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapters
<>30, 72 and 109).
<HI>JA1BA1LI IV. A hermit. The intensive penance of this
<>hermit compelled Indra to depute the celestial maid
<>Rambha1 to hinder it. Ja1ba1li became a prey to the entice-
<>ment of this heavenly beauty and a daughter was born
<>to them. This damsel was carried away by the King
<>Citra1n3gada. The hermit Ja1ba1li cursed Citra1n3gada to
<>become a leper. (Skanda Pura1n2a. Chapters 3, 143,
<>and 144).
<HI>JAD2A. An immoral brahmin. Jad2a, who set out to do
<>commercial business once was killed by thieves. As a
<>result of sins committed in previous births he was turned
<>into a Pis4a1ca. After his death his son, who led quite a
<>moral life went to Ka1s4i1 (Banares) to perform his father's
<>obsequies, and at the particular spot where his father
<>was living as Pis4a1ca the son recited Chapter 3 of the
<>Gi1ta1, on hearing which Jad2a got released from his state
<>as Pis4a1ca. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttarakhan2d2a and Ma1r-
<>kan2d2eya Pura1n2a).
<HI>JAGANNA1THA PAN2D2ITA. A very powerful and ruthless
<>literary critic in Sanskrit. He lived between 1590 and
<>1665. He is also known as Pan2d2itara1ja (King of scho-
<>lars). His most important and well-known work is
<>Rasagan3ga1dhara. To this day it remains as an invalu-
<>able treasure in rhetorics. (Alan3ka1ra S4a1stra).
<NI>His poetic theory is “Raman2i1ya1rthapratipa1dakah2 S4abdah2
<>Ka1vyam”. (Words which convey beautiful meanings
<>constitute poetry). He vehemently opposed the dhvani
<>va1da (suggestive words and phrases conveying more
<>meanings produce more rasa than they literally
<>and apparently appear to carry). Citrami1ma1m3sa1-
<>Khan2d2ana is another work of the Pan2d2itara1ja. In
<>this work another rhetorician named Appayadi1ks2ita is
<>strongly criticised. The allegoric poem, “Bha1mini1vila1-
<>sam”, is supposed to have been written by this great
<>rhetorician based on the untimely death of his wife,
<>Bha1mini1. He has also written five other works, the five
<>Lahari1s [Gan3ga1lahari1 etc].
<HI>JAGATI1. One of the seven horses which draw the cha-
<>riot of Su1rya. Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1, Tr2s2t2ubh,
<>Anus2t2ubh and Pan3kti are the seven horses. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part II, Chapter 8). [Page336-a+ 58]
<HI>JA1GRAT. According to the vision of R2s2is or sages, every
<>living being has four states. They are Ja1grat (waking
<>state), Svapna (dream), Sus2upti (profound sleep) and
<>Turi1ya (the fourth state of the soul, i.e. oneness with
<>Brahman in different degrees). The hermits and sages
<>have said about the four states of soul as given below:--
<NI>1) {%Ja1grat.%} In this state the individual soul is awake.
<>The five organs of senses, the five organs of activity and
<>the four inner organs of the living being will be active,
<>when the soul is awake. In this state he enjoys the outer
<>world through the five senses. That is, he sees with the
<>eyes, hears with the ears, tastes with tongue, smells with
<>the nose and feels with the skin. Every man thinks that
<>his understanding through the senses is real. It is the
<>individual soul which is responsible for this understand-
<>ing. But it is difficult to say whether these perceptions
<>through the senses are real or unreal. A hermit says as
<>follows:--“An individual soul travels from Ja1grat to
<>Svapna and from Svapna to Ja1grat as a fish which goes
<>from one shore to the other without touching anything.
<>For an individual soul the state of ja1grat is only one of
<>the four states. So we cannot give the verdict that
<>the state of Ja1grat alone is real and all the rest are
<>unreal.” The individual soul which is in the state of
<>Ja1grat enjoys the outer world and so it is ‘bahih2-
<>prajn5a’ (external--knowing). In this state the indi-
<>vidual soul enjoys the external world with the seven
<>organs and the nineteen faces. The seven organs are,
<>the two eyes, head, soul, body, urinal bladder and the
<>legs. The nineteen faces are the five senses, the five
<>organs of activity, the five life-breaths and the four
<>inner organs of mind, intellect, egoism and will. The
<>individual soul in the state of Ja1grat enjoys the external
<>world with these organs and faces. The soul in this state
<>is called ‘Vais4va1nara’. This state is experienced by all
<>the human beings of the world and so it is called Vais4-
<>va1naras

<NI>2) {%Svapna (dream).%} The second state of the individual
<>soul, is svapna (dream). He who indulges in dream,
<>forgets everything he had experienced in the state of
<>Ja1grat and creating new worlds he enjoys them. While
<>the five organs of senses and the five organs of activity
<>of the dreamer take rest, the four inner organs of
<>citta (will) Ahan3ka1ra (egoism) Buddhi (reason) and
<>manas (Mind) will be working. See what the author of
<>Upanis2ad says. “The dreamer separates his self from the
<>wide universe and creates his own radiance by his own
<>radiance. The light of the self is the light for the
<>dreamer. That man creates a chariot or an assemblage
<>of chariots or roads where there is no chariot or an
<>assemblage of chariots or a road; joy, delight or ex-
<>treme delight where there is no joy or delight or ex- [Page336-b+ 75]
<>treme delight; ponds, wells and rivers where there are
<>no ponds, wells and rivers. A dreamer is a Lord; the
<>state of the dream is the state of activity.” Another
<>hermit says as follows about the state of dream:--
<>“The dreaming individual soul which sees again things
<>which were seen here and there, hears again things
<>which were heard here and there, enjoys again things
<>which were enjoyed in places far and near, is really
<>enjoying greatness. He sees things seen and not seen,
<>heard and not heard enjoyed and not enjoyed. The
<>dreamer, like a King who travels with his train through-
<>out his country, as he pleases, plays by getting in and
<>out of his own body, and enjoys lofty experiences, and
<>so he is happier than he who eats alone and enjoys his
<>food. The individual soul in its state of dream is called
<>the Taijasa (the radiant) because he illuminates
<>himself by his own radiance. In this state the individual
<>soul does not touch anything and so it is sinless.

<NI>3) {%Sus2upti.%} The third state of the individual soul is
<>sus2upti (profound sleep). The soul alone is active in
<>this state. In sus2upti the individual soul desires for
<>nothing and does not indulge in dream. In this state
<>the individual soul does not think that the soul and the
<>body are two. So it is unitary. The sleeper is called
<>‘Pra1jn5a’ also. The individual soul which is in the state
<>of sleep, completely severs its connection with the
<>organs of senses, the organs of action, mind, the
<>Pra1n2amayakos4a (the chest of the life-breaths), the
<>manomaya kos4a (the cask of mind) and Vijn5a1namaya
<>Kos4a, the chest of knowledge orunderstanding. The mind,
<>the sense organs, Su1ks2mas4ari1ra (the suble body) and

<NI>2) {%Drank up the river Ganges.%} The river Gan3ga1, which
<>flowed through the earth in accordance with the
<>request of Bhagi1ratha, submerged the hermitage of
<>Jahnu. Jahnu became angry at this haughtiness of
<>Gan3ga1 and drank up the river, but at the entreaty of
<>Bhagi1ratha pushed Gan3ga1devi1 out through his ear.
<>(See under Gan3ga1). From that day onwards Gan3ga1
<>got the name Ja1hnavi1.
<HI>JA1HUS2A. A King of the period of R2gveda. It is stated in

<>As4vini1devas got him into their chariot and through
<>easily passable ways took him to the top of a mountain.
<HI>JAIGI1S2AVYA. A hermit who attained salvation by the
<>strength of his penance.
<NI>It is stated in Harivam3s4a Chapter 18, that three
<>daughters, Aparn2a1, Ekaparn2a1 and Ekapa1t2ala1 were
<>born to Hima1laya by Mena1 and the hermit Devala
<>married Ekaparn2a1 and the hermit Jaigi1s2avya married
<>Ekapa1t2ala1. In Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>229, mention is made that this hermit gave much
<>advice to the hermit Devala, son of Asita, about the
<>need for equanimity. On another occasion this hermit
<>talked to Yudhis2t2hira about the glory of S4iva. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 18, Stanza 37).
<NI>There is a story about how this hermit Jaigi1s2avya
<>attained the world of Brahma1. Once he reached the
<>hermitage of Devala, who showed the necessary
<>hospitalities. After a few days this hermit disappeared.
<>After that he used to be seen only at the time of meals.
<>Once Devala took his waterpot and went by air to the
<>sea, to fetch water. When he reached the sea he saw
<>Jaigi1s2avya bathing there. Devala had gone when
<>Jaigi1s2avya was in the hermitage. How did he reach
<>the sea before Devala? Devala filled the pot and
<>returned thoughtful. When he reached the hermitage
<>Jaigi1s2avya was there. After this Devala travelled
<>through the world of the inspired sages. Wherever he
<>went, he saw Jaigi1s2avya. He asked the inspired
<>sages how it was possible. They praised the attain-
<>ments, Jaigi1s2avya had obtained, by his ‘tapas’
<>(penance). Finally in the sight of everybody, Jaigi1s2avya
<>flew to the world of Brahma1. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 50).
<NI>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>11, Stanza 24, that this hermit Jaigi1s2avya sits in the
<>palace of Brahma1 and carries on meditation and con-
<>templation on Brahma1.

<>Literature” it is mentioned that Sumantu, Jaimini,

<>Vya1sa. In Devi1 Bha1gavata, it is mentioned that
<>Vya1sa had other disciples also in his hermitage, such
<>as Asita, Devala and others. The five disciples men-
<>tioned first gave publication to the work of Vya1sa
<>called ‘Jaya’, which was the original of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata. Vais4ampa1yana and Jaimini made some
<>additions to the work ‘Jaya’. In Sanskrit there is
<>another book called Jaimini Bha1rata, which contains
<>only As4vamedha Parva. (See under Guruparampara1).

<NI>This hermit who had practised continence from his
<>childhood lived in a forest. Ja1jali never thought rain,
<>heat of the sun, snow and such other natural things
<>as unbearable. Once this hermit stood like a pillar in
<>the forest, immersed in meditation. Two birds built
<>their nests in his matted hair. Non-violence being his
<>policy, he did not move. The birds came to their nests
<>every evening and stayed for the night. After a few
<>days they laid eggs in the nests. Still the hermit did not
<>move. The eggs were hatched. The hermit understood
<>that also. Still, he did not move. The young ones got
<>wings. They grew up and began to go out with the
<>parent birds. They went out in the morning and
<>returned in the evening. The hermit stood like
<>a pillar. One morning they went out and
<>did not return in the evening. The hermit
<>stood there for six days waiting for the return
<>of the birds. On the sixth day evening they
<>returned. Next time the hermit waited for a month
<>for the return of the birds. They did not return. So he
<>started from there and went to the sea and dipped in
<>the water and said, “there is no man more virtuous
<>than I either in water or on land” with haughtiness. But
<>the water demons said in an ethereal voice that Tula1-
<>dha1ra, the merchant of Ka1s4i1 was more virtuous than
<>he.
<NI>Hearing this Ja1jali went to Ka1s4i1 and saw Tula1dha1ra.
<>Tula1dha1ra greeted him gladly and they talked for a
<>long time. Ja1jali understood that Tula1dha1ra was far

<>extraordinary strength and valour. The black buffalo
<>called Paun2d2raka, which was born from the thigh of
<>Rudra, and is as quick as the mind and very fierce, is
<>the conveyance of Yama (the god of death). The
<>conveyance of Varun2a is the black crocodile called
<>‘Jaladhi’, born from the ear-wax of Rudra, and having
<>divine power of movement. The conveyance of Vais4ra-
<>van2a (the god of wealth) is a ferocious man with eyes
<>like two cart-wheels and body as big as mountain, who
<>was born from the leg of Ambika1. The eleven Rudras
<>have speedy horses, terrible serpents and white oxen

<>Jalandhara was the grandson of the sea of Milk. Once
<>he met with the headless Ra1hu, who said to Jalandha-
<>ra, the whole story beginning from the churning of the
<>sea of Milk. Jalandhara, became furious at the gods who
<>had churned his grandfather. So he collected a big
<>army of asuras and went to war with the devas. Though
<>a large number of Asuras were killed in the battle,
<>Indra and Vis2n2u were defeated and Vis2n2u was taken
<>captive and hidden under the sea. Finally Paramas4iva
<>went to fight with the Asura. In the fight Jalandhara
<>was killed and Vis2n2u was rescued. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 3 to 5). For further details see under Ma1ya1-

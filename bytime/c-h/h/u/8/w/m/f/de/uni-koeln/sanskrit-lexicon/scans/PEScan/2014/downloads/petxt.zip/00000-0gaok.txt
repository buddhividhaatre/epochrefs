<>{@A@}
<HI>A ({#a#}). The first letter (Vowel) of all Indian languages.
<>According to the Na1na1rtharatnama1la1 this letter has the
<>following meanings:--Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva, tortoise,
<>courtyard, battle, harem, jewellery, sea, Pa1rvati1 and bow-
<>string.
<HI>ABALA is one of the fifteen devas who were the sons of
<>Pa1n5cajanya. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 11).
<HI>ABHAYA was one of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was
<>killed by Bhi1masena. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67,
<>Verse 104; Dron2a Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 62).
<HI>ABHAYAM. King Idhmajihva divided his kingdom
<>Plaks2advi1pa into seven parts and gave them to his
<>seven sons. Abhayam is one of the parts. The other six
<>parts are:--S4ivam3, Yamasam3, Subhadram3, S4a1ntam3,
<>Ks2emam3 and Amr2tam3. See “Idhmajihva”. (Bha1gavata,
<>5th Skandha, Chapter 20, Verse 2). It is seen (from
<>M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30, Verse 9) that the
<>territory known as Abhayam was conquered by
<>Bhi1masena. (See Foot-note)
<HI>ABHIBHU. He was a King, the son of the King of Ka1s4i1
<>and a relative of the Pa1n2d2avas. He was killed by the
<>son of King Vasuda1na. He had a most wonderful
<>horse. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 151, Verse 63;
<>Karn2a Parva, Chapter 6, Verses 23-24; Dron2a Parva,
<>Verses 26-27).
<HI>ABHIMANYU I. He was the heroic son of Arjuna the cen-
<>tral figure of the Maha1bha1rata, by his wife Subhadra1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} He was descended from Vis2n2u in this order:
<>Brahma1-Atri-Candra-Budha-Puru1ravas-A1yus-Nahus2a-

<>S4antanu-Vya1sa-Pa1n2d2u-Arjuna-Abhimanyu.
<NI>2) {%Pu1rvajanma (Previous Birth).%} There is a story about
<>Abhimanyu's Pu1rvajanma in the Maha1bha1rata. It was
<>Varcas, son of Candra, who incarnated as Abhimanyu,
<>son of Arjuna. A conference took place between the
<>Devas and Candra about the incarnation of the Devas
<>in the world for the destruction of the wicked people.
<>Candra told the Devas: “I do not like to send Varcas,
<>whom I love more than my life, to the earth. Still, I
<>think it is not right to stand in the way of the plans of
<>the gods. You must agree to one condition if I am to
<>send my son. Let him be born as the son of Arjuna.
<>I am unable to be separated from him for more than
<>sixteen years. My son will enter into the Cakra Vyu1ha
<>of the enemies to be killed by them and return to me
<>in the sixteenth year.” The devas (gods) accepted this
<>condition. That is why Abhimanyu was killed in his
<>sixteenth year. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67).
<NI>3) {%Military Training and War.%} Abhimanyu received his
<>training in arms from his father Arjuna. Later, he
<>went with his mother Subhadra1 to Dva1raka1 and lived
<>for some time with his uncle S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. There he is
<>said to have received training in arms from Pradyumna,
<>son of S4ri1 Kr2s2na. After the incognito life of the [Page001-b+ 64]
<>Pa1n2d2avas, Abhimanyu married Uttara1, daughter of
<>the King of Vira1ta. War broke out between Kauravas
<>and Pa1n2d2avas. On the first day itself Abhimanyu
<>entered into a duel with Br2hatbala, King of Kosala.
<>In the terrible conflict with Bhi1s2ma, Abhimanyu broke
<>Bhi1s2ma's flagstaff. After that he assisted his father Arjuna
<>to fight against Bhi1s2ma. Verses 8-13 of Chapter 55 of
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva of the Maha1bha1rata describe Abhi-
<>manyu's fight with Laks2man2a in the second day's battle.
<>Then he took his place in the Ardha Candra Vyu1ha
<>(semi-circular phalanx) formed by Arjuna. He fought
<>fiercely with the Gandha1ras. He attacked S4alya and kill-
<>ed Jayatsena, King of Magadha, along with his elephant.
<>We find Abhimanyu assisting Bhi1masena in M.B. Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapters 63, 64, 69 and 94. After that
<>Abhimanyu defeated Laks2man2a in battle. Then he
<>defeated Vikarn2a, Citrasena and others also. Later he
<>took his position in the S4r2n3ga1t2aka Vyu1ha created by
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna. He started fighting with Bhagadatta.
<>He defeated Am3bas2t2ha and Alam3bus2a. Next he fought a
<>duel with Sudi1s2n2a. After that he encountered Duryo-
<>dhana, Br2hatbala and others. M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 10, Verses 47-52 are a description of Abhi-
<>manyu's heroism by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He snatched Paurava's
<>weapon and threw it on the ground. Next he fought
<>with Jayadratha and S4alya. Then he was caught in the
<>Cakra Vyu1ha (circular phalanx) of the enemies.
<>There he inflicted great losses upon the enemy forces.
<>S4alya was stunned and his brother was killed by
<>Abhimanyu. M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 38, Verses 23
<>and 24 describe the flight of the Kauravas in fear. At
<>this stage, even Dron2a1ca1rya praised Abhimanyu's
<>valour. Dus4s4a1sana fainted during his fight with Abhi-
<>manyu. Karn2a was defeated. Vr2s2asena, Satyas4ravas
<>and S4alya's son, Rugmaratha were slain. Duryodhana
<>fled. Laks2man2a was killed. Vr2nda1raka, As4vattha1ma1,
<>Karn2a and others were amazed by this terrible valour
<>of Abhimanyu. Six ministers of Karn2a were slain.
<>Next, As4vaketu, son of the King of Magadha was
<>killed. King Bhoja was also killed. S4alya was again
<>defeated. S4atrun5jaya, Candraketu, Meghavega, Suvarcas,
<>Su1ryabha1sa--who were all kings--were beheaded by
<>Abhimanyu. S4akuni was wounded by Abhimanyu's
<>arrow. Ka1lakeya, son of Subala was slain. M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 40, Verses 13 and 14 say that at this
<>stage, Prince Dus4s4a1sana beat Abhimanyu to death with
<>his mace.
<NI>4) {%After Death.%} M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 71, Verses
<>12-16 say that after death Abhimanyu attained the
<>immortal world of the Munis (Saints). King Pari1ks2it
<>was the son of Abhimanyu. In M.B. Svarga1rohan2a
<>Parva, Chapter 5, Verses 18-20, we find that after his
<>death, Abhimanyu entered the moon in his former form
<>of Varcas.
<NI>5) {%Other names of Abhimanyu.%} In the Maha1bha1rata
<>Abhimanyu has been referred to by several other names,
<>such as A1RJUNI, Saubhadra, Ka1rs2n2i1, Arjuna1tmaja,
<>S4ukra1tmaja1tmaja, Arjuna1para and Pha1lguni.
<NI>6) {%Other details.%} King Pari1ks2it was the son of Abhi-
<>manyu. Janamejaya was born as his son. It was Janame-

<>In the Bha1gavata the number mentioned is seven; but in the Malayalam version of the Bha1gavata (By Ramanujan Eluttacchan)
<>the number is eight. The original Bha1gavata says: “S4ivam3 Yamasam3. Subhadram3, S4a1ntam3, Ks2emam3, Amr2tam3 Abhayam iti
<>Vars2a1ni tes2u girayo nadyas4ca saptaivabhijn5a1ta1h2”. In the Malayalam Bha1gavata an eighth division called S4ivadam3 is seen.</F> [Page002-a+ 63]
<>jaya who performed Sarpasatra. (A ya1ga) S4ata1ni1ka was
<>the son of Janamejaya. S4ata1ni1ka had a son named
<>Sahasra1ni1ka. King Udayana, the jewel of the Candra
<>Vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty) was born to Sahasra1ni1ka by
<>the goddess Mr2ga1vati1 (See ‘Udayana’, stories about
<>this Udayana are very famous. Ka1lida1sa has mentioned
<>in his “Meghadu1ta” about the old rustics who thronged
<>the country-sides to tell and listen to Udayana stories).
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Madana Kan5cukalam3baka, 4th
<>Taran3ga).
<HI>ABHIMANYU II. One of the sons of Manu. The ten
<>sons born to Manu by Nadvala1 were: Kuru, Puru,
<>S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2t2oma,
<>Adhira1tra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Section 1, Chapter 13).
<HI>ABHIMANYU VADHA PARVA. A part (branch) of
<>Dron2a Parva. (See “Maha1bha1rata”).
<HI>ABHINAYA. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 342, Abhinaya
<>has been defined as follows: Abhinaya is the art of
<>presenting before the people the ideas that are to be
<>communicated to them. There are four divisions of
<>this art known as Sa1ttvika, Va1cika, A1n3gika and A1ha1rya
<>depending on Sattva, Va1k, An3ga and A1ha1rya. Besides
<>these, another division known as Abhima1nika (Abhi-
<>ma1nottha) may also be mentioned. This signifies the
<>expression of rasas like S4r2n3ga1ra. There are two kinds
<>of S4r2n3ga1ra known as Sam3bhoga and Vipralambha.
<>Four varieties of Vipralambha called Pu1rva1nura1ga
<>Vipralambha, Ma1na Vipralambha, Prava1sa Vipra-
<>lambha and Karun2a Vipralambha are mentioned. The
<>union after Vipralambha is Sam3bhoga-S4r2n3ga1ra. All
<>Sa1ttvika bha1vas are included in S4r2n3ga1ra. All these have
<>to be expressed through Abhinaya.
<HI>ABHI1RU. A Ra1jars2i who was born of the sixth
<>Ka1lakeya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 53).
<HI>ABHI1S2A1KAM. A Janapada (Village) of ancient India.
<>The warriors of this Janapada were called Abhi1s2a1kas.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 12; Chapter
<>93, Verse 2).
<HI>ABHI1SA1RAM. A Janapada of ancient India. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 94).
<HI>ABHISA1RI1. Arjuna conquered this city, which was
<>one of the ancient cities of India, in the course of
<>his Digvijaya (conquest of the world).
<HI>ABHIS2YANTA. A son born to Maha1ra1ja Kuru by
<>Va1hini1. He had three brothers named Caitraratha,
<>Muni and Janamejaya. Abhis2yanta was the younger
<>brother of As4vava1n and elder brother of Caitraratha.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verses 50-51).
<HI>ACALA I. 1) {%General.%} Acala was the son of Subala, a
<>King of Ga1ndha1ra. He was S4akuni's brother and a
<>heroic Charioteer on the side of the Kauravas. (M.B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 168, Verse 1).
<NI>2) Acala had also taken part in Yudhis2t2hira's Ra1ja-
<>su1ya. (A very expensive sacrifice--ya1ga--performed by
<>an emperor.) (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 7).
<NI>3) Acala had a brother named Vr2s2aka. In the battle
<>between the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas, Arjuna killed
<>Acala and Vr2s2aka. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 30,
<>Verse 11).
<NI>4) One night Vya1sa summoned the departed holy souls
<>and Acala also was among them. (M.B. A1s4va-
<>medhika Parva, Chapter 32, Verse 12). [Page002-b+ 65]
<HI>ACALA II. Name of a bull. Among the pa1rs2adas of
<>Skanda we see the bull named Acala. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 74).
<HI>ACALA III. An epithet of Maha1vis2n2u. Among the
<>thousand names of Maha1vis2n2u we see the name Acala
<>also. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 149, Verse 92).
<HI>ACALA. Subrahman2ya, who was born from S4iva's
<>semen which fell into the fire, was made Commander-
<>in-Chief (Generalissimo) by the gods to kill Ta1raka1sura.
<>A large number of warriors and mothers were
<>assigned to assist him. A woman named Acala1 was in-
<>cluded among those mothers. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 40, Verse 14).
<HI>ACCHODA1. A spiritual daughter of the Pitr2s. (For
<>further details see “Ama1vasu”).
<HI>ACCHODASARAS. A river, who was the daughter of
<>the Pitr2s called Agnis2va1ttas. (Hari Vam3s4a, Chapter 18,
<>Verse 26).
<HI>ACYUTA. (See Vis2n2u).
<HI>ACYUTA1YU. He was a heroic warrior on the Kaurava
<>side. S4ruta1yu was the brother of Acyuta1yu. Both of
<>them were killed by Arjuna in the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava
<>battle. These heroes attacked Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>furiously with their arrows and Arjuna had some
<>difficulty in killing them. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>93, Verses 7-42).
<HI>ACYUTA STHALA. This is an ancient village in
<>India. In ancient times S4u1dras of mixed castes
<>inhabited this region. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>129, Verse 9).
<HI>ADHARMA. A description of the lineage of Adharma
<>is found in Agni Pura1n2a. Him3sa1 (violence) is the
<>consort of Adharma. The couple procreated two
<>children, Anr2ta and Nikr2ti, and from them sprang
<>up Bhaya (fear), Naraka (Hell), Ma1ya1 (illusion),
<>Vedana1 (pain) etc. And, out of them Ma1ya1 brought
<>forth Death, the destroyer of (all) objects. Vedana1, in
<>its turn produced Sorrow and Grief out of Raurava.
<>From Death were born Disease, Senility, Sorrow, Intense
<>desire and Anger. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20).
<HI>ADHARMA. Adharma is a person who is an embodi-
<>ment of Adharmas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 53). Adharma's wife Nirr2ti delivered 3 children;
<>Bhaya, Maha1bhaya and Mr2tyu. Adharma had another
<>son, Darpa (conceit) born of Wealth. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 90, Verse 27).
<HI>ADHAS4S4IRAS I was a great sage. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is said to
<>have met the sage on his way to Hastina1pura. (M.B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 33, Verse 64).
<HI>ADHAS4S4IRAS II. There is a reference in Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a to a hell called Adhas4s4iras. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part
<>2, Chapter 6).
<HI>ADHI1RA. A King; also a great devotee of Lord S4iva.
<>Once he decreed death penalty on an innocent woman.
<>He also destroyed with his own hands a temple of S4iva.
<>As a consequence of those two sinful deeds he became
<>a devil after death. Ultimately by the grace of S4iva
<>he cast off the devil's form and became an attendant of
<>S4iva. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 111).
<HI>ADHIRA1JYA. A Kingdom in ancient India, described
<>in Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 44. Today this place
<>is known as Rewa.
<HI>ADHIRATHA. Foster father of Karn2a.
<NI>1) {%Lineage.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1-Atri-
<>Candra-Puru1ravas-A1yus-Nahus2a-Yaya1ti-Anudruhyu- [Page003-a+ 65]

<>Br2hadratha-Br2hanmanas-Jayadratha-Dhr2tavr2ta-Satya-
<>karma1-Adhiratha-Karn2a (foster son).
<NI>2) {%Foster father of Karn2a.%} Sage Durva1sas had taught
<>Kunti1 some mantras to get children, and Kunti1, then
<>unmarried, tested the first mantra with the Sun-god
<>as her object. The Sun-god appeared before Kunti1
<>and from his power she conceived and duly delivered a
<>child, Karn2a. Fearing obloquy Kunti1 concealed the
<>child in a box and floated it on the river, Ganges. At the
<>time Adhiratha, a great comrade of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came
<>to the river for a bath. His wife was one grieving
<>over not having a child of her own. So, when Adhiratha
<>found a child in the floating box, he took it home,
<>and himself and his wife Ra1dha1 brought up the child
<>with pleasure. The child was named Vasusena, and
<>the child grew up to become the famous Karn2a and
<>favourite friend of Duryodhana. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapters 67 and 130; Vana Parva, Chapter 309;
<>Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 2).
<NI>3) {%Some particulars.%} Adhiratha was King of An3ga. He
<>was a Su1ta (charioteer) and Karn2a grew up as his
<>son. Karn2a was sent to Hastina1pura to be trained
<>in the us2e of weapons, and it was here that Duryo-
<>dhana and Karn2a developed their friendship and
<>alliance. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 3).
<>S4ri1 Maha1devi1bha1gavata, in Chapter 3 relates the
<>following incident: “Thus lamenting Kunti1 sent the
<>box concealing Karn2a, by the nurse, to be floated in
<>the river, and after bath, food etc. she spent the hours
<>in the normal way within the inner apartment. Ra1ja1
<>Adhiratha bathing in the river saw the box floating in
<>the river”. These facts prove that Adhiratha was not
<>only the King of An3ga but a good charioteer as well,
<>and further a very good friend of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>4) We come across Adhiratha on the occasion of the
<>trial of skill in the use of arms between the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. When Karn2a entered the lists
<>the Pa1n2d2avas questioned his nobility of birth. Seeing
<>Karn2a's great humiliation and discomfiture Duryodhana
<>enthroned him immediately as King of An3ga. Vya1sa,
<>who witnessed the scene has given a picturesque des-
<>cription of it.
<HI>ADHOKS2AJA. A synonym of Maha1 Vis2n2u. (Kam3sa1ri-
<>radhoks2ajah2--Amarakos4a).
<HI>ADHRIGU. A great sage (Mahars2i) who lived during
<>the R2gvedic period. (R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka
<>16, Su1kta 112).
<HI>ADHR2S2YA1. A river. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9,
<>Verse 24).
<HI>ADHYAPA1YANA. A disciple of the great preceptor of
<>Atharvaveda, Sumantu. He divided Atharvaveda
<>into two parts and gave one to Utatthya and the other
<>to Vedadars4ana. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 12).
<HI>ADITI. 1) {%Genealogy.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and
<>son of Mari1ci married Aditi, daughter of Daks2apraja1-
<>pati. Aditi had twelve sisters: Diti, Ka1la1, Dana1yus,
<>Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pr2tha1, Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1,
<>Muni and Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Verse 12). Devas are sons born to Kas4yapa by Aditi
<>and hence they are known as A1diteyas also. Kas4yapa
<>married all the thirteen sisters including Aditi, and [Page003-b+ 65]
<>all living beings owe their origin to them. (See Kas4-
<>yapa).
<NI>2) {%Descendants.%} 33 sons were born to Aditi. 12 of them
<>are called Dva1das4a1dityas, viz. Dha1ta1, Aryama1, Mitra,
<>S4akra, Varun2a, Am3s4a, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1, Savita1,
<>Tvas2t2a1 and Vis2n2u. Amongst the other 21 sons are the
<>11 Rudras and 8 Vasus. (See M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65, Verse 15).
<NI>3) {%Main incidents.%} 1. {%How Maha1vis2n2u was born as the
<>son of Aditi.%} The Maha1bha1rata and the Ra1ma1yan2a
<>refer to a story about the birth of Maha1vis2n2u as the
<>son of Aditi. Vis2n2u entered the womb of Aditi as
<>Va1mana (Dwarf). This story was related by the sage
<>Vis4va1mitra to the boys Ra1ma and Laks2man2a while
<>they were accompanying the sage in the forest. When
<>they entered Siddha1s4rama Vis4va1mitra pointed to the
<>latter that the A1s4rama was sacred, because Maha1vis2n2u
<>had stayed there for long as Va1mana. The Devas
<>induced Maha1vis2n2u to obstruct the sacrifice (ya1ga)
<>being performed by Emperor Maha1bali, son of
<>Virocana. At that time Aditi, the wife of Kas4yapa
<>was doing penance so that Maha1vis2n2u might be born
<>as her son, and accordingly he entered her womb.
<>1000 years later she gave birth to Vis2n2u, and that child
<>was known as Va1mana. (See Va1mana; also M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 272, Verse 62, Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Verses 25 and 26, as also Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Canto 29).
<NI>2. {%Rebirth of Aditi.%} Once Kas4yapa made all arrange-
<>ments to perform a sacrifice (ya1ga). Having failed to
<>get the suitable cow for it, he stole Varun2a's cow and
<>conducted the ya1ga. Not only that, Kas4yapa refused
<>to return the cow even after the ya1ga was over.
<>Varun2a in hot anger rushed to Kas4yapa's hermitage.
<>Kas4yapa was absent, and his wives, Aditi and Surasa1
<>did not treat Varun2a with due respect. The enraged
<>Varun2a cursed them to be born in Gokula. He also
<>complained about the matter to Brahma1. Brahma1 told
<>Kas4yapa: “Since you, a learned person, have stolen
<>the cow, may you along with your wives be born in
<>Gokula and tend cows”. Accordingly Kas4yapa and
<>his wives, Aditi and Surasa1, were born respectively as
<>Vasudeva, Devaki1 and Rohin2i1 in Gokula in the 28th
<>Dva1para yuga. (This story has been told by Vya1sa
<>to Ra1ja1 Janamejaya). (Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>3. {%Aditi in prison.%} Devaki1 is Aditi reborn. There was
<>reason for Devaki1 being imprisoned on the orders of
<>Kam3sa. When Kas4yapa was living in an A1s4rama with
<>Aditi and Diti he was so much pleased with the
<>services of Aditi that he asked her to beg for any
<>boon she wished. Accordingly she prayed for an
<>ideal son. The boon was readily granted, and Indra
<>was the son thus born to her. The birth of Indra
<>engendered jealousy in Diti towards Aditi, and she
<>also demanded a son equal to Indra. Kas4yapa obliged
<>Diti also. As Diti advanced in pregnancy and her
<>beauty also increased Aditi got jealous of the former
<>and she called her son Indra and told him that unless
<>something was done in time, Diti would deliver a
<>child equal to him (Indra) thus relegating him pro-
<>bably to the place of second Deva. Thus admonished
<>by his mother the artful Indra approached Diti and
<>told her: “Mother, I have come to serve you”. Diti
<>was greatly pleased. Indra's services drove Diti to
<>sleep very quickly, and Indra used the opportunity [Page004-a+ 65]
<>to enter the womb of Diti and cut into 49 pieces the
<>child with his weapon, the Vajra. The child in the
<>womb began crying on receiving cuts with Vajra when
<>Indra asked it not to cry. (Ma1 ruda, don't cry) and
<>so the child got out of Diti's womb as 49 Ma1rutas
<>(winds). Then did Diti wake up and cursed Aditi as
<>follows: “Your son did treacherously kill my
<>offspring in the womb itself. So he will forfeit the
<>three worlds. You were responsible for the murder of
<>my child. You will, therefore, have to spend days in
<>prison grieving over your children. Your children also
<>will be annihilated”. Because of this curse of Diti,
<>Indra once lost Devaloka and had to live elsewhere,
<>and Nahus2a functioned, for a time as Indra. (See
<>Nahus2a). In the 28th Dva1para yuga Aditi trans-
<>formed as Devaki1 had to be a captive of Kam3sa, and
<>Kam3sa killed her children by dashing them on the
<>ground. (Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>4. {%Naraka1sura stole the earrings of Aditi.%} Naraka1sura, who

<HI>6. {%Budha cursed Aditi.%} A story in the Maha1bha1rata
<>refers to Budha's once cursing Aditi. The ever increas-
<>ing power of Asuras made the Devas anxious. Aditi,
<>the mother of the Devas decided to send them all to
<>annihilate the Asuras. She had finished cooking food
<>for her sons, and lo! there appeared before her Budha
<>and asked for food. Aditi asked him to wait pending
<>her sons taking their food hoping that there would be
<>some food left after that. This caused Budha to lose

<>This story is related by S4ri1 Kr2sna to his mother on
<>his birth as the son of Vasudeva. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama

<HI>ADRIKA1. A nymph (devastri1). There is a story in
<>Devi1bha1gavata about her being cursed by a Brahmin
<>and turned into a fish.
<HI>ADR2S2T2ABHAYA is the curse put on King Janamejaya

<>of Sarama1 went to the place and was thrashed by
<>the brothers of Janamejaya. Seeing her weeping child
<>Sarama1 naturally got angry. She cursed the king
<>thus: “My son did not commit any offence; he did
<>not even look at the havis (oblations), nor did he

<>Vasis2t2ha came walking towards him. False pride
<>prevented either of them from giving way to the
<>other. The King got angry and whipped S4akti. S4akti
<>cursed the king and he was converted into a demon.
<>This happened at a period when sages Vasis2t2ha and
<>Vis4va1mitra were at logger-heads. Vis4va1mitra got
<>admitted into the body of King Kalma1s2apa1da a
<>demon called Kim3kara, and the king set out to take

<>was further promised all support by Vis4va1mitra.
<>Kalma1s2apa1da ate up all the hundred sons of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Overcome with grief Vasis2t2ha attempted suicide
<>many a time. But the spirit (A1tman) did not quit

<>hermitage with Adr2s4yanti1, wife of S4akti. One day
<>Vasis2t2ha heard distinct sounds of the chanting of
<>the Vedas and Adr2s4yanti1 told him that a child of
<>his son, S4akti, was developing in her womb and that
<>the vedic sounds heard were sounds produced by
<>that son chanting the vedic hymns. Vasis2t2ha thus
<>was happy to hear that the dynasty will not become
<>extinct and, so, gave up all ideas of suicide. Another
<>day Kalma1s2apa1da in the guise of the demon hurriedly
<>came to devour Adr2s4yanti1 and Vasis2t2ha gave him
<>redemption from the curse. He was restored to his

<HI>AGASTYA.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in this order
<>Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Su1rya-Agastya.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} A story occurs in Uttara-Ra1ma-Carita
<>about the birth of Agastya. Nimi was the son of Iks2-
<>va1ku of the Su1rya dynasty. When he ascended the
<>throne he decided to celebrate a sacrifice of long
<>duration. He invited Vasis2t2ha to perform the sacrifice.
<>But Vasis2t2ha, who had to participate in the sacrifice [Page005-a+ 65]
<>of Indra, could not accept the invitation and Nimi
<>had to return disappointed. At this he got angry,
<>sought the help of S4ata1nanda, the son of the great
<>hermit Gautama and the sacrifice was begun. Vasis2t2ha
<>did not like this. He cursed Nimi that life might be
<>separated from his body. Nimi retorted with the same
<>curse. Vasis2t2ha's spirit separated itself from his body
<>and began to roam about in the sky. At last he re-
<>quested Brahma1 to provide him with a body. Brahma1
<>granted his wish and said that he would be born again
<>from Mitra and Varun2a.
<NI>When the spirit of Vasis2t2ha returned to the earth it
<>was Mitra and Varun2a moving about, having only one
<>body for both. Vasis2t2ha's spirit entered into that body.
<>One day Mitra-Varun2a happened to see the celestial
<>beauty, Urvas4i1 on the seashore. They embraced Urvas4i1
<>and immediately the spirit of Vasis2t2ha entered the
<>body of Urvas4i1.
<NI>After this Mitra and Varun2a separated themselves
<>from one another and assumed two different bodies.
<>Varun2a approached Urvas4i1 with lustful desire, but
<>rejecting him Urvas4i1 accepted Mitra. Varun2a had
<>seminal flow and this semen was taken and kept in a
<>pot. At the sight of this, remorse and passion arose
<>in Urvas4i1 and the semen of Mitra already received
<>in her womb oozed out and fell on the ground. This
<>also was. collected and kept in the same pot along with
<>that of Varun2a. After a few days the pot broke open
<>by itself and two babies came out. One was Agastya
<>and the other Vasis2t2ha. As these two were born of the
<>semen of Mitra and Varun2a, they came to be known
<>as Maitra1varun2is later. This story partly occurs in S4a1nti
<>Parva of Maha1bha1rata, Verse 343 of Chapter 88.
<NI>3) {%Education.%} Very little is mentioned in the Pura1n2as
<>about the education of Agastya. Still there are am-
<>ple proofs that he was well-versed in the Vedas and
<>sciences and well skilled in the uses of diverse weapons.
<>In Verse 9, Chapter 139 of Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Dron2a says to Arjuna as follows:
<NI>“Agnives4a, my teacher was the disciple of Agastya, in the
<>art of using bows and arrows and I am his disciple”.
<NI>When it is said that even Agnives4a the teacher of
<>Dron2a was a disciple of Agastya, his proficiency in the
<>art of using weapons could casily be discerned.
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} There is an interesting story behind the
<>marriage of such an austere man as Agastya, who had
<>brought all the passions under control. As the hermit
<>Agastya was walking along the forest, he saw his
<>ancestors (Pitr2s) hanging head downwards in a canyon.
<>He wanted to know the reason and they replied:
<>“Child; we would be allowed to enter heaven only
<>if sons are born to you. So get married as soon as
<>possible”. The necessity of marriage occurred to him
<>only then. But will there be any woman who could be
<>patient enough to become the wife of this bearded
<>dwarfish hermit? Agastya did not lose heart. At that
<>time the King of Vidarbha was doing penance to
<>obtain a son. Agastya collected the quintessence of
<>all living beings, with which he created an extre-
<>mely beautiful lady and named her Lopa1mudra1.
<>Agastya gave Lopa1mudra1 as daughter to the King of
<>Vidarbha. The King who was delighted at getting
<>such a daughter, employed hundreds of maids to look
<>after the child, who soon grew up to be a young lady.
<>Agastya once approached the King of Vidarbha [Page005-b+ 65]
<>and expressed his wish to have Lopa1mudra1 as his
<>wife. The King was in a dilemma. On the one hand
<>he did not like his beautiful daughter having the
<>brightness of fire, to be given as wife to the hermit,
<>clad in the bark of trees and wearing tufts of matted
<>hair. On the other hand he was afraid of the curse
<>of the hermit Agastya. As the King was trying hard
<>to find a solution, Lopa1mudra1 herself came to the
<>King and said “Father, I am happy to say that I shall
<>willingly become the wife of the hermit Agastya.” At
<>last her father consented and discarding royal garments
<>and ornaments, Lopa1mudra1 accompanied Agastya.
<>It is mentioned in Vana Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 5,
<>that they were married at Maha1sindhuti1rtha. After
<>their marriage they went to Gan3ga1dva1ra. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 96).
<NI>5) {%The story of how Agastya ate Va1ta1pi.%} While Agastya
<>was doing severe penance, Lopa1mudra1 attained
<>puberty and had menstruation. Longing for a child,
<>she went and stood beside Agastya. She expressed
<>her wish to lead a family life. Her demands did
<>not stop there. During conjugation, Agastya should
<>wear flower garlands and ornaments, and she must
<>be provided with divine ornaments. Agastya was
<>surprised at the enormity of her demands. Poor, penni-
<>less Agastya! Leaving Lopa1mudra1 in the hermitage
<>he went in search of money. He at first approached
<>King S4rutarva1, who produced accounts of his in-
<>come and expenditure and convinced Agastya that
<>he was having no balance at all. Agastya, accompa-
<>nied by S4rutarva1, then proceeded to King Bradh-
<>na1s4va. He also produced accounts and refused to help
<>Agastya, who then followed by S4rutarva1 and Bradh-
<>na1s4va went on to the wealthy King Trasadasyu,
<>who also producing his accounts refused to render
<>any help to Agastya. Finally Agastya accompanied
<>by the three Kings, went to the house of Ilvala, a
<>noble asura of immense wealth.
<NI>This asura Ilvala lived in Manimatpattana with his
<>younger brother Va1ta1pi. Once Ilvala approached
<>a hermit Brahmin and requested that his wish for
<>a son, having the power and status of Indra, be grant-
<>ed. The Brahmin refused to grant such a boon.
<>Since then Ilvala and Va1ta1pi considered Brahmins
<>as their enemies. The elder brother converted the
<>younger one (Va1ta1pi) into a goat and whenever a
<>Brahmin visited his house, he would kill the goat,
<>prepare mutton dishes and set them before his
<>guest. When he had finished eating, Ilvala would call
<>aloud. “Va1ta1pi, come out”. Breaking the stomach
<>of the guest open, Va1ta1pi would come out. In this way
<>Ilvala had killed a good number of Bra1hmins. It was
<>at this juncture that Agastya and the Kings came to
<>beg money of him.
<NI>Ilvala welcomed the guests with hospitality and as
<>usual killed the goat, prepared food with it and served
<>the food before Agastya. When Agastya had finished
<>eating, Ilvala called Va1ta1pi loudly. But Agastya slowly
<>said, “Va1ta1pi, ji1rn2o bhava” (Let Va1ta1pi be digested)
<>and immediately Va1ta1pi was digested in the stomach
<>of Agastya. The awe-stricken asura Ilvala gave each
<>Brahmin ten thousand cows and as much gold and
<>to Agastya he doubled the quantity of alms. Over
<>and above this, he presented Agastya with a chariot
<>hitched with two fine horses called Vira1va1n and [Page006-a+ 63]
<>Sura1va1n. Agastya returned to his hermitage and
<>adorned himself as Lopa1mudra1 had demanded. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 99).
<NI>6) {%Birth of a son.%} Lopa1mudra1 became pregnant.
<>Agastya told her, “A thousand ordinary sons, or
<>hundred sons, each having the strength of ten ordinary
<>sons, or ten sons, each having the strength of hundred
<>ordinary sons, or a son, greater and nobler than one
<>thousand sons--which of these do you prefer?”
<>Lopa1mudra1 preferred one son. When she was with
<>child Agastya again went to the forest to do penance.
<>After seven years of pregnancy Lopa1mudra1 gave
<>birth to a lustrous son. The hermit Dr2d2hasyu, who is
<>also called Idhmava1ha, is this son. This child is said
<>to have chanted the Vedas (Holy Scriptures) im-
<>mediately on his birth. He used to gather twigs for
<>kindling the sacrificial fire of his father, and hence he
<>got the name Idhmava1ha.
<F>*) Idhma--twigs of firewood. (Idhma=twigs of firewood) (va1ha=carrier).</F>
<NI>7) {%How he stamped the Vindhya mountain down.%} Once the
<>talebearer Na1rada happened to come to the Vindhya
<>Mountain, who gladly welcomed Na1rada, gave him a
<>seat, showed hospitality and asked for news. Na1rada said
<>“May you be blessed. Just now I am coming from the
<>Maha1meru. Indra, Agni (fire) and other gods live
<>there. Kaila1sa, Nis2adha, Ni1la, Gandhama1dana etc. are
<>mountains far nobler than this Meru. But they are
<>not so haughty as him. That the Sun and the Moon
<>and such others revolve round him, is the reason for his
<>arrogance”. On hearing these tales, Vindhya thought
<>that Meru should be taught a lesson. Once Vindhya
<>made his peaks grow higher and higher till they touched
<>the sky. The Sun, the Moon and others found it very
<>difficult to pass over the high peaks in their usual jour-
<>neys to the West, and so they had to roam about in
<>the sky. When the journeys of the Sun and the Moon
<>were hindered, everything in the world fell into chaos.
<>The gods came to Vindhya in groups and tried to
<>pacify him. But their attempts were futile. So they
<>approached Agastya and made their petition to him.
<>He agreed to pacify Vindhya somehow or other. Agas-
<>tya and his wife came to Vindhya from Ka1s4inagara.
<>When Vindhya saw Agastya he began to shiver with
<>fear. Contracting all his high peaks, he bowed before
<>Agastya, who said to Vindhya thus “Vindhya, I am
<>going to South Bha1rata. Let your heads be low till I
<>come back”. Vindhya agreed. Agastya passed on to
<>the South and built a hermitage in the Malaya1cala and
<>lived there. Since then Agastya had never gone to
<>the North and Vindhya had never risen up. As he had
<>made the mountain (Aga) bow its head he got the
<>name Agastya. (Tenth Skandha of Devi1bha1gavata).
<NI>8) {%Nahus2a transformed to a huge serpent by Agastya.%}
<>Devendra killed Vr2ttra1sura, an enemy of the gods.
<>As Devendra had resorted to treachery for killing the
<>enemy (see the word Vr2ttra1sura) he incurred the sin
<>of ‘Brahmahatya1’. Once Indra went to the Ma1nasasaras,
<>without the knowledge of anybody and hid himself in
<>the petal of a lotus flower. The gods and especially
<>S4aci1devi1 were much alarmed at the disappearance of
<>Devendra. Heaven was without a King. Bad omens
<>began to appear. Indra, who had hidden in the lotus
<>stalk in the shape of a water-snake, was not at all visible [Page006-b+ 64]
<>as the petals had closed over him. It was at this critical
<>moment that King Nahus2a had completed hundred
<>horse-sacrifices and became eligible for the throne of
<>Devendra. At a great gathering of the Gods Nahus2a
<>was elected as Devendra. Though Nahus2a got all the
<>celestial maids at his disposal in the Nandanodya1na
<>(Nandana Garden) his passion for women was not
<>satiated. So he began to have an eye on Indra1n2i1. She
<>was in sorrow and misery at the disappearance of her
<>husband Indra, and did not at all look with favour on
<>this new move on the part of the new Indra. She sought
<>the help of Br2haspati, who agreed to protect her
<>from Nahus2a. The newly-elected Indra could not tole-
<>rate this disloyalty on the part of Indra1n2i1. He became
<>furious and threatened Br2haspati with death, if Indra1n2i1
<>was not sent to him forthwith. All hermits gathered
<>round Nahus2a and tried with their advice to dissuade
<>him from this attempt, but he would not be dissuaded.
<>Nahus2a belittled Br2haspati and all the hermits and was
<>rude to them. Finally the hermits, being afraid of
<>Nahus2a, went to Br2haspati to persuade him to send
<>Indra1n2i1 to Nahus2a. Br2haspati suggested to Indra1n2i1 a
<>way of safety. Accordingly she came to Nahus2a and said
<>to him “Lord, to become your wife, is a matter of great
<>pleasure to me. But before that I must make sure if
<>my husband is living anywhere. So allow me to make a
<>search”. Nahus2a agreed to this and by the blessings
<>of Devi1, Indra1n2i1 found out her husband. But Indra
<>would not return to the court, with Indra1n2i1, who
<>then complained about Nahus2a's outrageous behaviour.
<>Indra advised her a new way to protect herself from
<>Nahus2a's onslaught.
<NI>Indra1n2i1 returned to Nahus2a and told him “Lord, wo-
<>men generally love pomp and glory. I have a mania
<>for vehicles. You should make a palanquin. Let the
<>palanquin bearers be hermits. You must come to my
<>house in that palanquin with hermits as your palanquin
<>bearers and then I will accept you as my husband.”
<>Nahus2a agreed. He employed Agastya and such other
<>hermits to bear his palanquin. He got into his palan-
<>quin and started for Indra1n2i1's house. His desire to
<>reach Indra1n2i1 was such that he thought the hermits to
<>be very slow. To make them quick enough he ordered
<>“Sarpa, Sarpa” (walk quick, walk quick). The hermits
<>began to run. Still Nahus2a was not satisfied. He kicked
<>at the heads of the hermits and whipped the dwarfish
<>Agastya.
<NI>Agastya got angry and cursed Nahus2a thus: “Since
<>you have whipped me saying ‘Sarpa Sarpa’, may you
<>be transformed into a maha1sarpa (huge serpent) and
<>fall into the great forest.”
<F>**) It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 100, that the person who cursed Nahus2a and turned him
<>into a huge serpent, was the hermit Bhr2gu, who had been hiding in the hair of Agastya.</F>
<NI>The horror-stricken Nahus2a pleased Agastya by praise.
<>Agastya said that Nahus2a would be freed from the
<>curse and attain heaven when he happened to meet
<>Dharmaputra. Nahus2a instantly changed into a
<>serpent of immense size and slided into a great forest
<>in the Hima1laya1s. (Devi1bha1gavata, 8th Sarga).
<NI>During their sojourn in the forest, the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visited many holy places and reached the Ya1muna
<>mountain in the Hima1laya1s. When Bhi1ma was passing
<>by the mouth of a cave he was attacked by a huge
<>serpent. In spite of his immense strength Bhi1ma could [Page007-a+ 65]
<>not extricate himself from the hold of the snake, who
<>eventually informed Bhi1ma of its previous history.
<>When Bhi1ma understood that the serpent was none
<>other than Nahus2a, a King of the Su1rya dynasty
<>(Solar), he felt sorry for him. Dharmaputra, who
<>came there in search of Bhi1ma, talked with Nahus2a,
<>who immediately regained his original form and
<>went to heaven. (Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 17 of
<>Udyoga Parva; Chapter 179 of Vana Parva; Chapter
<>342 of S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>9) {%How Agastya drank up the ocean.%} Indra ruthlessly
<>killed Vr2ttra1sura, who had been harassing the Gods,
<>with the help of the Ka1lakeyas. The frightened Ka1la-
<>keyas got into the ocean and hid themselves at the
<>bottom. From that hideout they decided to destroy
<>the three worlds. At night they came out on the
<>earth and ate a good deal of Brahmins, and caused
<>much damage to the hermitages of Vasis2t2ha and
<>Cyavana. All the Brahmins on the earth were terribly
<>afraid of the Ka1lakeyas. The gods went to Vis2n2u
<>and prayed for protection. Vis2n2u informed them that
<>the Ka1lakeyas could not be caught unless the ocean
<>was dried up, and this task could be performed only
<>by Agastya. So the Gods approached Agastya and told
<>him what Vis2n2u had informed them. With pleasure
<>Agastya accepted the job. Accompanied by the Gods
<>and hermits he neared the swaying and surging ocean.
<>While all were watching unwinkingly Agastya brought
<>the great ocean into his palm and drank it up very
<>easily and subsequently the Ka1lakeyas were killed.
<>Now the Gods again approached Vis2n2u and made
<>representation about the loss of the ocean. Vis2n2u told
<>them that by the penance of Bhagi1ratha the divine
<>Gan3ga1 would fall into the earth and then the ocean
<>will be filled. In this way the earth regained its lost
<>ocean. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapters 101 to
<>105).
<NI>10) {%Agastya cursing Kubera and his companion.%} In the
<>course of their sojourn in forest, the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visited several holy places and reached the proximity
<>of the Hima1layas. Leaving his brothers behind,
<>Arjuna went up the Maha1meru to worship S4iva.
<>Years passed by. At last his brothers also started
<>for the Maha1meru in search of Arjuna and with
<>the help of the hermits Vr2s2aparva1 and A1rs2t2is2en2a, they
<>reached Kuberapuri1 (the capital of Kubera). There
<>Bhi1ma destroyed the army of Kubera and killed
<>Man2ima1n, his friend and favourite. Dharmaputra,
<>repenting of his younger brother's iniquity bowed
<>before Kubera and asked him with politeness, why the
<>power of Gods gave way to the power of man. Kubera
<>replied that it was due to the curse of Agastya and
<>began to depict the event thus: Once my friend
<>Man2ima1n and myself were going, in a chariot, to be
<>present at the singing and chanting just begun at
<>Kus4avati1. At that time Agastya was standing in his
<>hermitage on the bank of Ka1lindi1, performing Sun
<>worship. When Man2ima1n saw this from the sky, he
<>spat on the head of Agastya, who instantly getting wild
<>cursed me. “Lo, Kubera, your friend Man2ima1n
<>spat on my head in your sight. So this Man2ima1n and
<>your army will meet with death at a man's hand.
<>When they die you should not feel sorry for them. If
<>it becomes possible for you to meet the man who
<>killed Man2ima1n you will be liberated from the curse.” [Page007-b+ 65]
<>It is this curse that brought about the death of
<>Man2ima1n and the army. When Kubera saw Bhi1ma
<>face to face his curse was revoked. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 160).
<NI>11) {%Agastya cursing Ma1ri1ca and Ta1d2aka1.%} The boys
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went to the forest with Vis4va1-
<>mitra for protecting sacrifice. When they entered the
<>Ta1d2aka1 forest Vis4va1mitra told them the story of
<>Ta1d2aka1 thus:--
<NI>Ta1d2aka1 is the daughter of Suketu, a semi god of the
<>tribe Yaks2a. Being childless for a long time Suketu was
<>miserable and began to do penance before Brahma1,
<>who blessed him and granted his wish and a daughter
<>was born to him. This daughter was named Ta1d2aka1.
<>Brahma1 blessed her, giving her the strength of one
<>thousand elephants. Ta1d2aka1 grew up and became a
<>young woman. Suketu gave her in marriage to Sunda,
<>son of Iharjha. Ta1d2aka1 gave birth to a son called
<>Ma1ri1ca. When Sunda was killed, Ta1d2aka1 got wild
<>and ran into the hermitage of Agastya causing much
<>havoc there. At this Agastya got angry and cursed
<>her to become a Ra1ks2asi1 (giantess) and instantly
<>the bodies of Ta1d2aka1 and Ma1ri1ca were deformed.
<>Ta1d2aka1 could not control her anger and she demo-
<>lished the hermitage of Agastya. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,

<NI>12) {%The story of the theft of lotus.%} Once Bhr2gu,
<>Vasis2t2ha and other hermits went on a pilgrimage,
<>with Indra as their leader. On the way they
<>reached Brahmasaras, in the holy place of Kaus2iki1.
<>Agastya had grown some lotus flowers there. The
<>pilgrims plucked stealthily all the lotus flowers nur-
<>tured by Agastya and ate them. The furious Agastya
<>got into the midst of the hermits in search of the
<>culprit. None admitted the theft. Finally he caught
<>hold of Indra, as the thief. Indra said “O, Lord,
<>had it not been for my eagerness to hear discourses
<>on duty from your face, I would not have stolen
<>your lotus flowers.” Saying thus Indra returned the
<>lotus flowers. Agastya was pleased and let Indra

<>became angry and began to burn the Asuras to death,
<>by the merits of his penance. Many of them fell down
<>on the earth and some fell into Pa1ta1la (the nether world).

<>Thunder and Rain) stopped rain in the world. Crops [Page008-a+ 65]
<>could not be raised. But Agastya provided everybody
<>who took part in the sacrifice, with sumptuous meals.
<>The hermits wondered how Agastya could do this. Some
<>of the hermits feared that the sacrifice would have to be
<>stopped before the stipulated time, if the drought con-
<>tinued. Agastya told them not to fear, and that if
<>Indra refused to send rain, he himself would become
<>Indra and protect the subjects. Indra was horrified,
<>when he heard this and he began to send rain regu-
<>larly. (Maha1bha1rata, A1s4vamedhika Parva, Chapter
<>92).
<NI>15) {%Story of Gajendramoks2a (The redemption of an elephant).%}
<>In the Bha1rata a story occurs, as to how Agastya
<>cursed King Indradyumna, and turned him to an ele-

<>absorbed in deep meditation on Vis2n2u, Agastya reach-
<>ed the palace. Being immersed in meditation the King
<>failed to notice the arrival of the great hermit, who
<>getting angry with the King, cursed him to become an
<>elephant, for one thousand years. Instantly the King
<>was deformed into a big tusker and quitting the palace
<>it went to a big forest and lived there happily with the
<>she-elephants there. At that time a hermit named De-
<>vala was doing penance in that forest. One day Hu1hu,
<>a gandharva (a class of semi-gods) enjoying the com-
<>pany of some celestial maids came to the place where
<>Devala had put up his hermitage. The hermit saw
<>the Gandharva and the maids playing and bathing in
<>the pond in front of his hermitage in complete nudity.
<>Getting angry Devala cursed Hu1hu and he was de-
<>formed into a crocodile. This pond which was in the
<>Triku1t2a Mountain was thus under the suzerainty of
<>the crocodile. The tusker (Indradyumna) entered the
<>pond to drink water. The crocodile caught hold of the
<>leg of the elephant. Each tried to pull the other with
<>equal force. This fight is said to have lasted for a
<>thousand years. When both were tired, godly feelings
<>began to dawn in their minds. Then, riding on an
<>eagle Maha1vis2n2u appeared before them, cut them
<>asunder with his Cakra1yudha (the wheel-weapon)
<>and both were given deliverance. (Bha1gavata, 8th
<>Skandha, Chapter 2).

<>immediately the image of Vis2n2u in the temple chang-
<>ed by itself into a S4ivalin3ga (idol representing S4iva).

<>come here everyday and eat corpse and when I had
<>completed ten thousand days the hermit Agastya
<>would come here and that when I offered him a golden

<>Agastya, who had performed such wonderful deeds by

<>hermitages. In the Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, A1ran2yaka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 11, a description is given, of a beautiful hermit-
<>age of Agastya, and the peaceful atmosphere that
<>prevailed in and around it. Agastya had presented to

<>visited his hermitage. Agastya had accompanied S4ri1
<>Ra1ma and his followers on his return journey to
<>Ayodhya1 from Lan3ka1, with Si1ta1 after killing Ra1van2a.
<>There is a legend in the Tamilna1d that Agastya was a
<>member of the first two ‘San3ghas’ (groups) of the
<>“three San3ghas”, mentioned in Tamil literature. As
<>Agastya was dwarfish he is mentioned as Kurumuni,
<>(short hermit) in Tamil works. He has written a Tamil
<>grammar on music, literature and drama. But this
<>work is not available now. The Tamil Grammar
<>‘Tolka1pyam’, which is considered to be the oldest gram-
<>mar, was written by Tolka1pya1r, one of the twelve
<>disciples of Agastya. Even today in certain temples in
<>the Tamilna1d, Agastya-worship is carried on. Kambar,
<>has mentioned about Agastya in his Ra1ma1yan2a. A great

<>trapped in his belly. Agha then closed his mouth and
<>all the boys including S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a were now imprisoned
<>inside his body. Some of the boys died. Realizing the
<>situation S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a now enlarged his body. His body
<>grew larger and larger until at last it burst open the body
<>of the serpent (Agha). Thus Agha was killed. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a

<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were for some time living in an

<>Ra1van2a and save the world from his atrocities. Si1ta1 is
<>going to be a cause for that. Time is not far for you
<>to finish this duty of yours. Ra1van2a is soon to come and

<>Si1ta1 after killing Ra1van2a you will be compelled to
<>throw your wife into the fire to test her chastity. At [Page011-a+ 65]
<>that time I will take back the replica and give you
<>back your real wife”. S4ri1 Ra1ma was very much
<>pleased to hear this. Agni then, by his yogic powers
<>created a Phantom Si1ta1 and gave her to him. Ra1ma
<>kept this as a secret even from Laks2man2a. In the great
<>Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle Ra1van2a was killed and S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>took back Si1ta1 to his kingdom. Then respecting public
<>opinion and wishing to establish in public the purity
<>of his queen King S4ri1 Ra1ma put her into the fire. At
<>that moment Agni took back the replica and gave
<>back the real Si1ta1 to S4ri1 Ra1ma. Si1ta1 thus came out
<>from the fire unscathed. Later, on the advice of Ra1ma
<>and Agni, the Phantom Si1ta1 went to the sacred place
<>Pus2kara and started doing tapas (penance) there.
<>After doing tapas for a long period of three lakhs of
<>divine years this Phantom Si1ta1 became known as
<>Svargalaks2mi1. It was this Svargalaks2mi1 that later on
<>in the Dva1para yuga came out from the yajn5a kun2d2a

<NI>7) {%The story of how Agni burnt the big forest, Kha1n2d2ava.%}
<>When the indigestion continued without abate for some
<>time Agni approached Brahma1 and asked for a cure.
<>Brahma1 declared that his indigestion would be cured
<>if Agni could burn the huge forest, Kha1n2d2ava, the
<>abode of the enemies of the Devas. Agni immediately
<>started consuming the forest. But the inhabitants of the
<>forest soon quenched the fire. Disappointed Agni went
<>to Brahma1 again and the latter advised him to wait for
<>some time till the advent of Nara-Na1ra1yan2as to that
<>forest. They would then help Agni to burn the forest.
<>Agni waited for the time to come. At that time the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were living in Indraprastha with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>When the heat became unbearable there Arjuna and
<>Kr2s2n2a came to the banks of river Yamuna1. Hearing
<>about the arrival of Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna who were none
<>but the incarnations of Na1ra1yan2a and Nara, Agni dis-
<>guised as a brahmin approached them and requested
<>them to help him to burn the Kha1n2d2ava forest. Agni
<>added that any attempt of his to burn the forest was [Page011-b+ 65]
<>always foiled by Indra who would send a heavy down-
<>pour of rain to quench the fire because Taks2aka, an
<>intimate friend of Indra, was living there.
<NI>To gain his end Agni gave Arjuna an arrow-case
<>which would never be empty, a chariot bearing a
<>monkey flag, four white horses adorned with gold
<>chains and also the famous Ga1n2d2i1va bow. To S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>he gave the cakra1yudha or the divine wheel-weapon.
<>(All these military equipments were once given to
<>Agni by Varun2a.) When all these were given to them
<>Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna got ready to help Agni to burn the
<>forest. Agni started burning the forest, Indra at once
<>sent a heavy downpour of rain and Arjuna created a
<>canopy of arrows above the forest preventing the rains
<>from falling on the forest. Agni carried on his work
<>undisturbed, the forest was burnt and Agni was cured
<>of his indigestion. (S4lokas 233 to 239, A1di Parva,

<NI>8) {%Agni falls in love.%} As an inaugural procedure to the
<>great Ra1jasu1ya which Dharmaputra performed at
<>Indraprastha his four brothers Bhi1ma, Arjuna, Nakula
<>and Sahadeva conducted a victory march to the four
<>different sides of the kingdom. Sahadeva who turned
<>south conquered many kings including Dantavaktra
<>and Bhi1s2maka and reached a country called Ma1his2mati1-
<>pura. There he had to encounter a powerful king
<>called Ni1la. Before long there broke a fire in his camp.
<>Disheartened, Sahadeva prayed to the God, Agni, for
<>help. It was then that Sahadeva came to know about
<>the ties between Agni and Ni1la.
<NI>King Ni1la had a beautiful daughter named Sudars4ana1.
<>Once when she was talking to her father after having
<>entered the Agni-hotra Agni fell in love with her. From
<>that day onwards Agni became dreamy about the
<>beautiful lips of Sudars4ana1. It reached a stage when
<>Agni would burn only if it was blown by the lips of
<>Sudars4ana1. This ended in Agni marrying Sudars4ana1.
<>After the marriage Agni lived in the palace of his
<>father-in-law, King Ni1la, as a useful ally. It was at this
<>time that Sahadeva came to conquer Ni1la. But Agni
<>knew that for the proper conduct of the Ra1jasu1ya of

<>and dropped down into the lap of the Emperor who

<>came chasing its prey and finding the dove in the lap
<>of the Emperor said: “O King, is it proper on your

<>offered many things including his kingdom to the

<>of flesh from the body of the Emperor. S4ibi without
<>any hesitation cut a portion of his thigh and weighed
<>it against the dove in a scale. The dove weighed more
<>and the Emperor started putting more and more flesh
<>from his body to make the weight equal. But the dove [Page012-a+ 59]
<>always weighed more and at last the Emperor said he
<>would weigh himself against the dove. As the weak and

<>with his beautiful consort, Ahalya1. Once Indra had an
<>intercourse with her privately and Gautama coming to
<>know of the misdeed cursed her and turned her into

<NI>11) {%How sage Bhr2gu cursed Agni.%} Sage Bhr2gu was living
<>with his wife Puloma1 in his a1s4rama. Puloma1 became
<>pregnant. One day when Bhr2gu wanted to go out for
<>a bath in the river he asked Agni to keep a watch over
<>his pregnant wife. There was a demon by name
<>Puloma who was once in love with Puloma1. On this
<>particular day Puloma entered the a1s4rama to see
<>his former love. When he entered the a1s4rama Puloma
<>saw Agni there burning with a brilliant flame in the
<>fire-pit. Puloma said: “O God of fire, if I ask you a
<>question you must give me an impartial reply. I was
<>in love with this Puloma1 and I had accepted her as
<>my wife spiritually. But, then, her father gave her to
<>Bhr2gu. Who, then, is the true owner of Puloma1?”
<>Agni was afraid of Bhr2gu. Yet he explained the posi-
<>tion honestly. “It is true that Puloma1 has married
<>Bhr2gu. But he has not married her according to Hindu
<>rites.” Hearing this the demon changed himself into
<>the shape of a swine and carried away Puloma1. On
<>the way Puloma1 delivered a male babe and it fell on
<>the ground. The boy was named Cyavana. It was this
<>boy that became later on the famous Cyavana Maha-
<>rs2i. Even at birth the boy was brilliant as the Sun
<>to look at and Puloma, the demon, noticing the un-
<>usual brilliance of the child left the mother and child
<>on the way and fled frightened. Puloma1 returned to the
<>a1s4rama carrying the child weeping profusely all the
<>way and creating a lanchrymal river called Vadhu1-
<>saras. As soon as she entered the a1s4rama the angry
<>sage asked “Who told Puloma that you are my wife?”
<>Puloma1 then told her husband all that happened there
<>and Bhr2gu called Agni and cursed him thus: “May
<>you be a consumer of all things on this Earth”. Great-
<>ly aggrieved Agni went away and hid himself. The
<>absence of Agni created chaos in all the three worlds;
<>Heaven, Earth and the Nether-world. A deputation of
<>all the afflicted people waited upon Brahma1 and [Page012-b+ 65]
<>Brahma1 modified the curse and declared that all that
<>Agni touched would become pure. Agni was consoled
<>and he started his work as usual.
<NI>12) {%How Agni cursed frogs, birds and elephants.%} Many
<>important events took place while Agni was under-
<>ground cursed by Bhr2gu. It was during that time that
<>Pa1rvati1 cursed all the Devas and the Devas were
<>defeated by the asuras (demons). The necessity of a
<>warrior capable of defeating the asuras arose then.
<>The idea of creating Lord Subrahman2ya came up and
<>Brahma1 said that only Agni could help them in this
<>matter since Agni was the only one who escaped from
<>the curse of Pa1rvati1, being underground at the time
<>of the curse. The Devas started a vigilant search but
<>Agni was not to be found. Agni was then hiding inside
<>the ocean. The ocean was getting hot and the animals
<>living there found their life unbearable. Frogs went to
<>the devas and told them where Agni was hiding.
<>Enraged at this Agni cursed the frogs saying that they
<>would never be able to find the taste of anything.
<>Frogs went weeping to the devas who in turn blessed
<>the frogs saying that they would acquire the ability to
<>move about easily in any darkness. Agni changed his
<>place of hiding and went and hid in a big banyan
<>tree. An elephant going by that way found him out
<>and informed the devas; knowing this Agni cursed
<>the elephants saying that its tongue would go deep
<>inside. But the devas blessed the elephants saying that
<>the position of the tongue would never be a hindrance
<>to free eating and that elephants would be able to eat
<>anything and everything. Agni left the banyan tree
<>and hid himself in the hollow of a S4ami1 tree. A little
<>bird living in that tree gave information to the devas
<>and the devas found him out before he got time to
<>leave the place. Agni cursed the bird saying that its
<>tongue would always be curved inside and the devas
<>blessed it saying that the curvature would help it to
<>sing beautiful songs. Since Agni was found out from
<>S4ami1 tree this tree became sacred. Since this finding
<>out of Agni after a long absence is like a re-birth of
<>Agni the Pura1n2as mention that Agni was born from
<>the S4ami1 tree. The Devas then requested Agni to help
<>them to create a son capable of conquering the de-
<>mons.
<F>*) Katha1saritsa1gara gives another version of why Agni went and hid himself under the ocean. When Ka1ma, the God of Love, was
<>burnt to death by S4iva, Pa1rvati1, S4iva1's wife, did not find a way to get a child for her from her husband. At last Brahma1 approached S4iva and
<>told him that the absence of Ka1ma was making creation difficult. S4iva then declared that thereafter Ka1ma would find a place in the minds of all
<>living beings including himself. Pa1rvati1 and S4iva immediately commenced a sexual life which went on incessantly for a hundred years with-
<>out reaching the climax. The world was agitated and the universe stood on the verge of ruin. The Devas decided to send Agni to intervene But
<>Agni was afraid of S4iva and so went and bid himself under the ocean. (Chapter 6, La1va1n2akalambaka of Katha1saritsa1gara).</F> (Chapter 85, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>13) {%Birth of Subrahman2ya.%} At that time Varun2a performed
<>a ya1ga. All the dikpa1lakas (zone guardians of the
<>universe) including S4iva participated in the ya1ga.
<>Seeing the beautiful wives of the sages S4iva had emission.
<>Taking the semen in his hand he put it into the fire.
<>Agni carried it to Gan3ga1 and requested her to take it
<>for conception. Though she at first refused she took it,
<>became pregnant and finally delivered a male child
<>whom she threw into the forest S4aravan2a. It was this
<>child who became known as Ka1rttikeya or Subrah-

<>Damayanti1 who was confused prayed that she should
<>be shown the real Nala. The gods then changed into

<>they went to Pan5canada and started doing penance.
<>Ram3bha sat in the centre of Pan5ca1gni (five fires) and
<>Karam3bha in water to do penance. Indra afraid of the
<>severe and powerful tapas of the two took the form of
<>a crocodile and killed Karam3bha who was doing pe-
<>nance in water by dragging him down to the water. Be-
<>reaved Ram3bha started to commit suicide by jumping
<>into the fire. God Agni appeared before him then and
<>asked him what he wanted. Ram3bha then said that he
<>should get a son who would be famous as a warrior in
<>all the three worlds. Agni agreed. Ram3bha on his way
<>back saw a voluptuous she-buffalo and married her
<>at yaks2a kava1t2a. They lived a happy married life and
<>one day a he-buffalo envious of their life attacked
<>Ram3bha and killed him. Grief-stricken Ram3bha's wife
<>jumped into the funeral pyre and committed suicide.
<>Then from the fire arose a demon named Mahis2a1sura
<>(Mahis2a=Buffalo. Asura=Demon). This buffalo-
<>demon became a terror to all in the three worlds later
<>on. (Chapter 5, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<>ed at this. Agni argued that it was not proper on the
<>part of Brahma1 to give anybody else more brilliance
<>than himself. So as a protest against this Agni dis-
<>appeared from the world. Even An3giras was annoyed at
<>Agni's disappearance and so he went and consoled Agni
<>and took him to Brahma1. Brahma1 declared that hence-
<>forth the world world recognize Agni as the father and
<>An3giras as his son. Thus Agni got the first place in
<>effulgence. This is a story told by sage Ma1rkan2d2eya

<>the vehicle he uses is a goat. (Chapter 51, Agni Pura1n2a).
<NI>15) The sage, Agastya, converted the Vis2n2u idol at the
<>Kutta1lam temple into one of S4iva and when people
<>around started an agitation Agastya sent forth flames
<>of fire through his eyes. (Asura Ka1n2d2a of Ska1nda
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>16) Agni was born to Pururavas as a son named Ja1ta-
<>vedas. (Chapter 14, Navama Skandha of Bha1gavata). [Page015-a+ 65]
<NI>17) The Devas wanted help to clean their hands when
<>oblated materials stuck to their hands and Agni creat-
<>ed from water three sons named Ekata, Dvita and
<>Trita for this purpose. Of these Trita fell into a well
<>while drawing water. Seeing him fall the demons
<>closed the well but Trita broke the top and came out.
<>(Su1kta 52, Anuva1ka 10, Man2d2ala 1 of R2gveda).
<NI>18) Once the earth looked like heaven because of the
<>innumerable celestial beings who came to earth in search
<>of Agni. (Su1kta 65, Anuva1ka 12, Man2d2ala 1 of R2g-
<>veda).
<NI>19) The Sun hands over his effulgence to Agni in the
<>evening and takes it back from him in the morning. (A
<>fact from S4ruti--Su1kta 71, Anuva1ka 12, Man2d2ala 1 of
<>R2gveda).
<NI>20) For making fire for the sacrificial ceremony the
<>sages use two Aran2i sticks (These are two pieces of wood,
<>one upper and another lower, and fire is produced by
<>attrition). It is believed that the sages get the strength
<>to produce fire from it through Vya1na, one of the forms
<>of Va1yu (air). So R2gveda describes Agni as the son of
<>Va1yu. (Su1kta 112, Anuva1ka 16, Man2d2ala 1).
<NI>21) In the times of the R2gveda Agni was worshipped
<>as a God. (Su1kta 1, Anuva1ka 1, Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<NI>22) Lord S4iva entered into an elaborate and long
<>conjugal play for creating Subrahman2ya. Hundred
<>years went by and still the preliminaries never ended.
<>The universe was on the verge of a collapse and so
<>the devas decided to send Agni to put a stop to this
<>libidinal play of S4iva. But Agni was afraid of S4iva and
<>therefore absconded and hid himself in the ocean. The
<>ocean became hot and the water-animals unable to
<>bear the increasing heat went and informed the devas of
<>Agni's hiding place. Agni cursed them all saying that all
<>of them would go dumb. He then went to the Mandara
<>mountain in the shape of an owl and hid there. But the
<>devas went there also and picked him up. Agni then by
<>his terrible heat stimulated S4iva into action. S4iva
<>threw his semen into Agni and Agni poured it into
<>Gan3ga1 and Gan3ga1 delivered a child which later on be-
<>came Subrahman2ya. (Taran3ga 6, La1va1n2akalam3baka
<>of Katha1saritsa1gara).
<NI>26) {%Conclusion.%} Agni stands next to Indra in impor-
<>tance in the Vedas. Because Agni1 was indispensable for
<>ya1gas the care of Agni became very important. Accord-
<>ing to the R2gveda the birth of Agni is different. Born
<>of the clouds Agni reaches the earth as lightning. Then
<>Agni forsakes its form and becomes invisible. It was
<>Ma1taris4va1 who gave form to Agni and gave him to the
<>Bhr2gu family. From that day onwards it became
<>possible to produce fire and the R2gveda describes how
<>Agni is produced by sages by the use of Aran2i sticks.
<>The main job of Agni is to receive the oblations from
<>devas when they conduct ya1gas.

<>Ra1van2a, he wanted to accept her as his wife only after
<>her purity had been tested and proved. So he decided to
<>test her by fire (Agnipari1ks2an2a). Si1ta1 shed tears at the
<>thought that her husband doubted her chastity.
<>Laks2man2a, at Ra1ma's bidding, made a pyre. Si1ta1

<>of how Ahalya1 was cursed by her husband, Gautama,
<>and was turned into a stone is told in different versions
<>in different pura1n2as. The following is the version in the
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. When Vis4va1mitra was taking back
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a from the forest to the palace of
<>Janaka they came across an a1s4rama on their way. Giving
<>details about that a1s4rama Visva1mitra told the princes
<>thus: “This is the a1s4rama where the sage, Gautama, was
<>living with his wife, Ahalya1. Indra fell in love with the
<>beautiful Ahalya1 and while the sage was out for bathing
<>Indra entered the a1s4rama in the disguise of the sage
<>himself and took bed with her. But before Indra could
<>get out Gautama himself came to the a1s4rama and en-
<>raged at what he saw, cursed them both. Indra was to
<>lose his testicles and Ahalya1 was to turn into a stone.
<>But taking pity on her the sage declared that she would
<>take her original form the moment Ra1ma of treta1 yuga
<>came to that place and touched the stone by his foot.
<>Testicleless Indra went to devaloka and there his friends
<>feeling sorry for him, substituted a goat's testicle and
<>got him to normal.” While Vis4va1mitra was talking to
<>the princes, S4ri1 Ra1ma's foot touched the stone and Ahalya1
<>stood up in all beauty. Ahalya1 and Gautama lived in
<>the same a1s4rama again for another long period.
<NI>In Katha1saritsa1gara this story is told in a slightly diffe-
<>rent yet more interesting way. As soon as Gautama
<>entered the a1s4rama Indra turned himself into a cat.
<>Angrily the sage questioned Ahalya1, “who was standing
<>here when I came in?” Ahalya1 replied, “Eso thiyo khu
<>majjara” (Es2ah2 sthitah2 khalu ma1rjja1rah2). It was a cat
<>which was standing there. Here Ahalya1 used a pun on
<>the word ‘majjara’ and tried to be honest. ‘Majjara’ is
<>the Prakrit form of the word ‘ma1rjja1rah2’ which means cat.
<>But ‘majjara’ has another meaning also. (ma=mine
<>ja1ra=lover i.e. majja1ra=my lover). So Ahalya1 did not
<>lie to her husband. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1nakalam-
<>baka).
<NI>3) {%How Ahalya1 happened to bring up the mighty monkeys, Ba1li
<>and Sugri1va.%} Once Arun2a, the charioteer of Su1rya (the
<>Sun) went to devaloka to see the dance of the celestial
<>maidens there. Since there was no admission to the dance
<>for men Arun2a disguised himself as A1run2idevi1 and sought
<>admission; seeing the beautiful form of A1run2idevi1 Indra
<>fell in love with her and that night a child was born to
<>Indra by her. On the advice of Indra A1run2idevi1 took the
<>child to Ahalya1 before daybreak and left it there to be
<>looked after by her. It was this child which later on
<>became the famous Ba1li.
<NI>Arun2a went a bit late that morning to his master, the
<>Sun. The latter wanted an explanation and Arun2a told
<>him what had happened. The Sun then asked Arun2a to
<>become A1run2idevi1 again and seeing the enchanting figure
<>the Sun also got a child of her. This child also was taken
<>to Ahalya1 and it was this child that later on became the
<>famous Sugri1va.
<HI>AHALYA1HRADA(M). A sacred pond in the tapovana [Page018-a+ 65]

<HI>AHARA. A son born of Danu to Kas4yapa. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, S4loka 25, Chapter 65).
<HI>AHICCHATRA. This was the capital of the state Ahi-
<>cchatra which Dron2a got from Drupada, the King of
<>Pa1n5ca1la.
<HI>AHICCHATRA(M). A state under the sovereignty of

<>Ahicchatra to Dron2a and got his release. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, S4lokas 73 to 76, Chapter 137).
<HI>AHIM3SA1. Non-injury. There are opinions both in favour
<>of and against Ahim3sa1 in the pura1n2as. S4ukra1ca1rya ex-
<>tols the importance of Ahim3sa1 to the asuras (demons)

<NI>“Oh, foes of the devas, I shall tell you the truth which is
<>good for you. Non-injury to any living being is the most
<>righteous thing. Do not molest even those who come to
<>kill you. Even that act would be ‘him3sa1’ (injury). It
<>was those brahmins who were attached to worldly plea-
<>sures and addicted to overeating that enjoined in the
<>Vedas that him3sa1 is permissible for ya1gas.” (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skanda 4). Ma1rkan2d2eya Muni (sage) says thus:
<>“Why should I mind the innumerable killings going on
<>unnoticed in this world full of life. People of old speak
<>very sacredly about Ahim3sa1. But O best of brahmins,
<>who can live in this world without injury to another
<>life?” (M.B., Aran2ya Parva, S4lokas 32 & 33, Chapter
<>208).
<HI>AHIRATHA. A King of the Pu1ru dynasty. (See under
<>Pu1ru vam3s4a).
<HI>AHIRBUDHNYA. One of the sons of Vis4vakarma1. Five
<>sons and one daughter were born to Vis4vakarma1 of his
<>wife Surabhi1. They were Ajaikapa1t, Ahirbudhnya,
<>Tvas2t2a1, Rudra, Barhis2mati1 and Sam3jn5a1. (See under
<>genealogy of Vis4vakarma1).
<HI>AHITA1. A river of ancient Bha1rata. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,

<HI>AHORA1TRA(M). (See under Ka1lama1na).
<HI>AHOVI1RA. A sage who adhered strictly to the injunctions
<>associated with the Va1naprastha stage of life. (M.B.,

<HI>AI ({#E#}). This diphthong means a female sage (yogini1)
<>according to the Agni Pura1n2a (Chapter 348 of Agni

<>94 of A1di Parva of the M.B.).
<HI>AILA I. Son of Ila1; Puru1ravas. (See under Ila1).
<HI>AILA II. A member of the court of Yamara1ja. (See S4loka
<>16, Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.). In S4loka 65, Chap-
<>ter 115 of Anus4a1sana Parva, it is said that he never ate
<>non-vegetarian food in his life. [Page018-b+ 64]
<HI>AINDAVA. (See paragraph 13 under the word
<>BRAHMA1).
<HI>AIRA1VATA I. A large elephant, son of Ira1vati1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in this order:--
<>Vis2n2u-Brahma1-Kas4yapa-Bhadramata1-Ira1vati1-Aira1-
<>vata. Kas4yapa married Daks2a's daughter, Krodhavas4a1
<>who bore him ten daughters. They were: Mr2gi1, Mr2ga-
<>manda1, Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, Sveta1,
<>Surabhi1, Sarasa1 and Kadru. Of these Bhadramata1 had
<>a daughter named Ira1vati1 and Aira1vata was her son.
<>Aira1vata was not human in shape; he was a large ele-
<>phant. (See Sarga 14, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Indra's Va1hana.%} Indra made Aira1vata his conveyance
<>(va1hana). Indra was Kas4yapa's son by Aditi. Aira1vata
<>also was descended from Kas4yapa. So Indra took
<>Aira1vata as his va1hana.
<NI>3) {%Aira1vata caused the churning of the ocean of Milk.%} There
<>is a story of how Aira1vata was responsible for the churn-
<>ing of the milk-ocean (Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam). Once
<>some maidens of devaloka presented a garland of flowers
<>to sage Durva1sas. When Durva1sas visited Indra's court
<>he gave that garland to Indra. Indra put it on the tusks
<>of his va1hana, Aira1vata. The fragrance of the flowers
<>attracted a swarm of bees which became an intolerable
<>nuisance to Aira1vata. So Aira1vata tore the garland off
<>his tusks and hurled it away. When Durva1sas heard
<>this, he took it as an insult. In his anger he cursed all the
<>gods--the curse was that all gods should become subject
<>to old age and the decrepitude and infirmities of old age.
<>But though Durva1sas cursed the gods, he also prescribed
<>a remedy. The gods could redeem themselves from the
<>curse by drinking Amr2tam obtained from the ocean of
<>Milk (Maha1vis2n2u lies on the serpent, S4es2a on this ocean).
<>The curse began to operate and the gods lost their peren-
<>nial youth. The gods then befriended the Asuras and
<>with their help they churned the ocean of Milk. They
<>got the nectar (Amr2tam), drank it and regained their
<>youth. (See under the word AMR2TAM).
<NI>4) There is another story about Aira1vata--A story of
<>how he also rose out of the ocean of Milk. It is said that
<>when the devas and asuras churned the ocean of Milk,
<>Aira1vata also came up along with the other good things.
<>This story is narrated in the 18th Chapter of A1di Parva
<>of the Maha1bha1rata. The explanation given is that when
<>Durva1sas cursed the gods, Aira1vata was oppressed with
<>a sense of guilt because he was responsible for the curse.
<>So he took refuge in the ocean of Milk and there started
<>propitiating Maha1vis2n2u. There is however no warrant
<>for such an explanation in the pura1n2as. But the expla-
<>nation sounds plausible because it explains the absence
<>of Aira1vata during the interval between Durva1sas's
<>curse and the churning of the sea. Aira1vata is represented
<>as a white elephant. It is probable that he became white
<>after his long residence in the ocean of Milk. This lends
<>some additional plausibility to the above explanation.
<NI>5) {%Aira1vata, the Lord of the elephant.%} In the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>we are told how Aira1vata was made the chief of all ele-
<>phants. When the Mahars2is had crowned Pr2thu as the
<>sovereign King, Brahma1 gave new posts of honour to
<>many of the devas. He made SOMA (Moon) the lord
<>of the Stars and Planets, of Brahmins, Yajn5as and herbs.
<>Kubera was made the overlord of all Kings; Varun2a
<>was made the master of the seas and all water; Vis2n2u,
<>the lord of the A1dityas and Pa1vaka (Fire) the lord of [Page019-a+ 62]
<>the Vasus. Along with these Brahma1 made Aira1vata the
<>lord of all elephants. (Chapter 22, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%The breaking of Aira1vata's tusks.%} There is a story of how
<>the tusks of Aira1vata were broken narrated in the A1sura-
<>ka1n2d2a of Skanda Pura1n2a. Once an asura (demon)
<>named S4u1rapadma attacked devaloka. A fierce battle
<>ensued between the gods and asuras. In the course of
<>this battle, Jayanta, Indra's son, was hit by an arrow
<>and at once he fell dead. Enraged by this Aira1vata
<>rushed at S4u1rapadma's chariot and shattered it to
<>pieces. Aira1vata then attacked S4u1rapadma who broke his
<>tusks and hurled him down to the earth. Aira1vata lay
<>paralysed for a long time; then he got up, retired to a
<>forest and prayed to Lord S4iva. With the grace of S4iva
<>Aira1vata regained his lost tusks and was able to return
<>to devaloka.
<NI>7) {%Other details about Aira1vata.%} (1) There is a belief
<>that Aira1vata is one of the eight elephants guarding the
<>eight zones of the universe. These eight elephants are
<>called the As2t2adiggajas. Aira1vata is supposed to guard
<>the eastern zone. (Chapter 66, A1di Parva, Maha1-
<>bha1rata).
<NI>(2) Aira1vata and three other diggajas are supposed to
<>reside in Pus2kara Island. (Chapter 12, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AIRA1VATA II. Name of a serpent born to Kas4yapa and
<>his wife Kadru. This is mentioned in S4loka 5, Chapter
<>35, A1di Parva of the Maha1bha1rata. Arjuna's father-in-
<>law and Ulu1pi's father, Kauravya belonged to the family
<>of this serpent. (See S4loka 18, Chapter 213, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>AIRA1VATA. An asura who was killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>(See Chapter 38, Sabha1 Parva, Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>AIRA1VATAGHAT2T2A. Name of a place near the sea-
<>shore, lying to the north of the mountain, S4r2n3gava1n.
<>(See S4loka 37, Chapter 6, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>AIS2I1KAM. Name of a small division of a parva of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>AITAREYA I. A great scholar with profound knowledge
<>of the Vedas. Being a non-brahmin he was not able to
<>learn the Vedas from a guru. In spite of this handicap
<>he acquired considerable scholarship and wrote a learned
<>commentary on the R2gveda. This commentary ranks
<>high among the various commentaries on the Vedas.
<HI>AITAREYA II. Son of Sage, Ma1n2d2uki by his first wife,
<>Itara1. Being the son of Itara1 he came to be called Aita-
<>reya. As a boy he was very pious and used to chant the
<>mantra “Namo Bhagavate Va1sudeva1ya” frequently. But
<>he was a shy and silent boy and his father mistook his
<>silence to be a sign of stupidity. Dissatisfied with him and
<>being desirous of having learned sons, Ma1n2d2uki married
<>another woman named Pin3ga1 and had four sons by her
<>who all became very learned. Once Itara1 called her
<>son and told him that his father regarded him as an
<>unworthy son and was often twitting her using insulting
<>words for having given birth to so unworthy a son. She
<>then told him of her resolve to sacrifice her life. Aita-
<>reya then made an enlightening discourse to her and
<>dissuaded her from her determination to commit suicide.
<>Some time later Lord Vis2n2u appeared before them and
<>blessed the mother and son. On the advice of Vis2n2u
<>Aitareya participated in the yajn5a conducted by Hari- [Page019-b+ 65]
<>medhya at Kot2iti1rtha and there he made a learned
<>speech on the Vedas. Harimedhya was so pleased with
<>him that he gave his daughter in marriage to him.
<>(See Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapters 1, 2 and 42).
<HI>AJA I. A king of the Solar dynasty.

<>Aja never used to take meat.
<HI>AJA II. Among the different kinds of R2s2is mentioned by
<>Yudhis2t2hira, we find a class of R2s2is called Ajas. (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 26). These Ajas had attained
<>Heaven by Sva1dhya1ya (self discipline) alone.
<HI>AJA III. King Jahnu had a son named Aja. Us4ika was
<>the son of this Aja. King Us4ika prayed to Indra for a
<>son. Indra himself was born as the son of Us4ika assum-
<>ing the name Ga1dhi. Satyavati1 was born as the daughter
<>of Ga1dhi. She was married to R2ci1ka. Paras4ura1ma's
<>father, Jamadagni was the son of R2ci1ka. (M.B., S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 49).
<HI>AJA IV. By the grace of S4iva Surabhi1 was able to purify

<HI>AJAGAVA. Ajagava is a bow made of the horns of a
<>goat and a cow. Brahmins tormented the right hand of
<>the King Vena. From it the brilliant Pr2thu who shone
<>brightly like the God Agni, appeared as the son of Vena.
<>At that time the very first Ajagava bow, divine arrows
<>and armours dropped from the sky. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,

<>Gardda-Suketu and Br2hatks2etra were Bharata's sons.
<>Br2hatks2etra had four children, who were: Nara, Maha1-
<>vi1ra, Garga and Hasti. Of them Hasti had three sons:

<HI>AJAMI1D2HA II. We come across another Ajami1d2ha also
<>in the Lunar Dynasty. He married Sudeva1, daughter
<>of Vikan2t2ha a King of the Lunar Dynasty. This Aja-
<>mi1d2ha had 2400 children by his four wives, Kaikeyi1,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1, Vis4a1la1 and R2ks2a1. Of them Sam3varan2a
<>married Tapati1, the daughter of Vivasva1n. See Tapati1
<>Sam3varan2a. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verses
<>35-37).
<HI>AJA1MILA. Aja1mila's story is given in the Bha1gavata as
<>an example to illustrate that even the most wicked person
<>can attain Vis2n2upa1da (Salvation).
<NI>Aja1mila was a Brahmin who was once sent by his
<>father to the jungle to fetch samit (leaves and twigs
<>to make the sacrificial fire). Aja1mila met there a beauti-
<>ful S4u1dra woman. Forgetting everything, the Brahmin
<>made her his wife and children were born to them.
<>When that Brahmin, who was the very embodiment of
<>all vices, reached the age of eightyseven, the time came
<>for him to die. Yamadu1tas (Agents of Yama--the god
<>of death) had arrived. The frightened Aja1mila shouted
<>loudly the name of his eldest son, ‘Na1ra1yan2a’. Hearing
<>the repeated call of his name ‘Na1ra1yan2a’, Maha1vis2n2u
<>appeared there and dismissed the agents of Yama. From
<>that day Aja1mila became a devotee of Vis2n2u and did
<>penance on the bank of the Ganges and after some years
<>attained salvation. (Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha,
<>Chapter 1). [Page020-b+ 65]
<HI>AJAMUKHA (AJAVAKTRA). He was one of the
<>soldiers in Skanda's army. (M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter

<>Asuras one of the routed Asuras had fled to Pa1ta1la (Hell).
<>Surasa1 was his daughter. Brahma1's grandson, Kas4yapa
<>married Surasa1. She gave birth to six children--S4u1rapa-
<>dma1, Sim3hika1, Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura, Aja1mukhi1, and
<>Gomukha. The Asura woman Aja1mukhi1 is one of them.
<NI>3) {%Chief events.%} (1) {%Marriage with Durva1sas.%} Once
<>S4u1rapadma1 called his two brothers, Sim3havaktra and
<>Ta1raka1sura and ordered them to set up two cities, one
<>to the north and the other to the south, of Maha1meru.
<>In obedience to his elder brother, Ta1raka1sura started
<>with one half of the army and set up a city to the south
<>of Maha1meru. That city was named Ma1ya1pura. Sim3ha-
<>vaktra lived in the city on the northern side of Maha1-
<>meru. Their sister Aja1mukhi1 went about enticing men to
<>satisfy her lustful passion. Once, in the course of her
<>wanderings, she met Durva1sas in the Hima1layan valley.
<>They fell in love and even married. The two Asuras,
<>Ilvala and Va1ta1pi were born from their union. They
<>insisted on sharing their father's achievements between

<>hands of Agastya. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Asura Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(2) {%The cutting off of Aja1mukhi1's hands.%} While wandering
<>with her lustful passion, Aja1mukhi1 once went to the S4iva
<>temple at Ka1s4i. There she happened to meet Indra's
<>wife, S4aci1devi1. In order to give her to her brother,
<>S4u1rapadma1, Aja1mukhi1 caught hold of S4aci1devi1. S4aci1-
<>devi1 screamed aloud. Suddenly S4iva appeared there
<>with His sword. Even then Aja1mukhi1 refused to release
<>S4aci1devi1. S4iva rescued Indra1n2i1 (S4aci1devi1) by cutting off
<>Aja1mukhi1's hands. Hearing this, S4u1rapadma1 sent his
<>army and imprisoned the Devas. The imprisoend
<>Brahma1 at the instance of S4u1rapadma1, restored Aja-
<>mukhi1's hands. S4u1rapadma1's son, Bha1nugopa fought
<>against the remaining Devas and defeated them. (Skanda

<HI>AJARA. Tapantaka, the minister of King Vatsa, told
<>him the story of a man named Ajara to illustrate the law
<>that all people will have to suffer the consequences of
<>their actions in a previous birth. The story is given be-
<>low:--
<NI>Once upon a time, there lived a King named Vinayas4i1la
<>in Vila1sapura, in the city of S4ri1kan2t2hanagari1. After
<>some years, the King was affected by wrinkles of old age.
<>A physician named Tarun2acandra came to the palace to
<>cure the King of his wrinkles. “The King should remain
<>alone in the interior of the earth for full eight months.
<>He has to use a medicine while remaining there. It
<>should not even be seen by anyone else. I myself am to
<>administer the medicine”--This was the physician's
<>prescription. The King agreed. Accordingly the King [Page021-a+ 65]
<>and the physician spent six months in the interior of the
<>earth. After that the physician, after a search, found a
<>man who exactly resembled the King and brought him
<>to the interior of the earth. After two more months,
<>the physician murdered the King and came out with the
<>new man. The people welcomed him with honour as
<>the King who was cured of his wrinkles. This man was
<>Ajara. After some time, the physician approached
<>Ajara for his reward. Ajara said: “It is by my Karma-
<>phala (consequence of my actions in my previous birth)
<>that I have become King. In my previous birth I re-
<>nounced my body after doing penance. According to the
<>boon which God gave me on that occasion, I have be-
<>come King in my present birth”. The physician returned
<>empty-handed. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Ratnaprabha1-
<>lam3baka, 6th Taran3ga).
<HI>AJAVINDU. He was a King, born in the dynasty of the
<>Suvi1ras. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74, Verse 14).
<HI>AJEYA. He was a King in ancient Bha1rata. Ajeya's name
<>is found among the names of the Kings mentioned by
<>San5jaya to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. All these Kings were mighty
<>and generous rulers who were the recipients of divine
<>arrows. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 234).
<HI>AJI1GARTA (R2CI1KA). He was a greedy Brahmin. (See
<HI>R2CI1KA I
<NI>King Haris4candra who was distressed by having no
<>children, propitiated god Varun2a. Varun2a blessed
<>him saying that a son would be born to him. But
<>the condition was that the child should be sacrificed
<>to Varun2a. When the child was born, Haris4candra did
<>not like to sacrifice the boy. The sage Vis4va1mitra suggest-
<>ed that instead of sacrificing his own son it would be
<>enough if he bought another boy and sacrificed him.
<>Accordingly, Haris4candra sent his minister to find out
<>and purchase a Brahmin boy for the sacrifice. At that
<>time there lived in Ayodhya1 a greedy Brahmin named
<>Aji1garta. He had three sons. In the course of his search,
<>the minister came across this needy Brahmin and asked
<>him whether he was willing to sell one of his three sons.
<>He continued: “Why should you be in this wretched
<>state of poverty and misery? Sell one of your sons and
<>you will get 100 cows as the price”. The minister's
<>words and the price offered for the son made a deep
<>impression on the Brahmin's mind. He thought:
<>“It is impossible for me to earn 100 cows. Even if it were
<>possible how long would it take? If I sell him I shall
<>get hundred cows at once. What a lucky chance! The
<>loss of a son is nothing.” So thinking, he sold his son
<>S4unas4s4epha. (For the rest of the story, see the word
<>“S4unas4s4epha”. Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandhas 7, 8).

<>He was killed in a battle and the King became much
<>depressed. Na1rada consoled him with other stories and

<>mother of Akrodha, was the daughter of Pr2thus4rava1.
<>(S4loka 21, Chapter 95, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>have gone to heaven after completing the fourth a1s4rama
<>of life namely, Sannya1sa. The Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava
<>battle was over. As the eldest, Dharmaputra performed
<>obsequies to all those of his kith and kin dead in the war.
<>He was then met by many sages including Vya1sa and
<>Na1rada who comforted him in his bereavement. When
<>Dharmaputra later met Bhi1s2ma the latter among many
<>other stories told him the story of Akr2tas4rama also.
<>(S4loka 17, Chapter 244, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKR2TAVRANA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Akr2tavran2a was a great sage of
<>erudition and was a disciple of Paras4ura1ma. He is ex-
<>tolled in the Pura1n2as and it is said that Su1ta who recited
<>first the story of Maha1bha1rata to an assembly of sages in
<>the forest of Naimis4a was a disciple of Akr2tavran2a.
<>(Skandha 12 of Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) {%How he became a disciple of Paras4ura1ma.%} Para ura1ma
<>was returning after obtaining arrows from Lord S4iva
<>after pleasing him by fierce penance. He was walking
<>briskly through the dense forests anxious to be at the side
<>of his preceptors to get their blessings. As he passed a
<>great cave he heard a moan and on getting to the site
<>of the sound found a brahmin boy being attacked by a
<>tiger. The tiger immediately fell dead by an arrow from [Page022-a+ 65]
<>Paras4ura1ma. Lo! the tiger turned into a gandharva
<>freed now from a curse because of which he was for years
<>living as a tiger. The gandharva bowed down respect-
<>fully and thanked the sage for giving him relief and left
<>the place. The brahmin boy fell down at the feet of
<>Paras4ura1ma and said, “Great Lord, because of you I
<>have now become Akr2tavran2a meaning one who has not
<>received any wound. (Akr2ta=not having secured.
<>Vran2a=wound). I shall, therefore, be your disciple for-
<>ever hereafter”. From that day onwards he never left
<>Paras4ura1ma but followed him as his disciple.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) In the story of Maha1bha1rata we
<>find Akr2tavran2a in several different contexts appearing
<>on behalf of Paras4ura1ma. It was Akr2tavran2a who told
<>Dharmaputra the life and exploits of Paras4ura1ma during
<>the exile of the Pa1n2d2avas in the forests. (Chapters 115 to
<>117, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(2) In Chapter 83 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<>Akr2tavran2a meeting S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a while the latter was going
<>to Hastina1pura.
<NI>(3) In Chapter 173 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<>Akr2tavran2a detailing the history of the Kaurava dynasty
<>to Duryodhana.
<NI>(4) Akr2tavran2a has played a very important role in the
<>story of Amba1, daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1. Amba1
<>along with her two sisters, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1, were
<>brought down to Hastina1pura by Bhi1s2ma for his brother
<>Vicitravi1rya to marry. But on knowing that Amba1 had
<>mentally chosen Sa1lva as her husband, Bhi1s2ma allowed
<>her to go back to Sa1lva. But on her return to Sa1lva he
<>refused to accept her and she came back to Hastina1pura.
<>Bhi1s2ma then requested Vicitravi1rya to accept her as
<>his wife which, unfortunately, Vicitravi1rya also refused
<>to do. Amba1 then turned to Bhi1s2ma and besought him
<>to marry her which, much to his regret, he could not do
<>because of his vow of celibacy. Thus forsaken by all,
<>all her sweetness turned into bitter hatred towards
<>Bhi1s2ma and she remained alive thereafter only to kill
<>Bhi1s2ma. But even the foremost of warriors were not
<>willing to antagonise Bhi1s2ma and so her appeal to help
<>was not heeded by any. It was then that Hotrava1ha her
<>grandfather on the maternal side met her and directed
<>her to Paras4ura1ma. When she went to Paras4ura1ma it
<>was Akr2tavran2a who received her and on hearing her
<>sorrowful tale encouraged her to seek vengeance on
<>Bhi1s2ma. Again it was he who persuaded Paras4ura1ma to
<>champion her cause and go for a fight against Bhi1s2ma.
<>During the fight Akr2tavran2a acted as charioteer to
<>Paras4ura1ma. (S4loka 9, Chapter 179, Udyoga Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(5) Akr2tavran2a was one of the many sages who were
<>lying on a bed of arrows during the great Kuruks2etra
<>battle. (S4loka 8, Chapter 26, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKRU1RA.

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4vaphalka of the Vr2s2n2i dynasty married
<>Nandini1, daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1 and Akru1ra was
<>born to them. Akru1ra was an uncle of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a but is
<>respected more as a worshipper of Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) He became famous as a commander
<>of the Ya1dava army. (Chapter 220 of A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>Akru1ra was partaking in the same. (S4loka 10, Chapter
<>218, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<NI>(5) Akru1ra came to the country called Upaplavya for
<>attending the marriage of Abhimanyu. (S4loka 22, Chap-
<>ter 72, Vira1t2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(6) Akru1ra and A1huka always quarrelled with each
<>other both alleging that the other sided with the opposite
<>camp of Kr2s2n2a. (S4lokas 9 to 11, Chapter 81, S4a1nti
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(7) Kam3sa planning to kill Balabhadrara1ma and S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a conducted a festival called Ca1papu1ja1 (worship
<>of the bow). It was Akru1ra whom Kam3sa sent to bring
<>Balabhadra and Kr2s2n2a for the festival. Akru1ra under-
<>stood the plot, informed Kr2s2n2a about it and also advised
<>Kr2s2n2a to kill Kam3sa. (Das4ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>(8) Akru1ra fought against Jara1sandha on the side of
<>Kr2s2n2a. (Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>(9) On another occasion Kr2s2n2a, Balabhadra and Ud-

<>Kunti1 and the Pa1n2d2avas. Akru1ra met his sister Kunti1
<>and talked to her for a long time and also met Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and talked to him after which he returned to
<>Dva1raka1. (Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>(10) Akru1ra went to Hastina1pura as a messenger from
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Refer sub-para 3 of para 13 under Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>4) {%Domestic life.%} Akru1ra married Sutanu1, daughter of

<HI>AKS2A I. (Aks2akuma1ra).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended in order from Vis2n2u as
<>follows: Brahma1-Pulastya-Vis4ravas-Ra1van2a-Aks2a.
<>(Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three sons were born to Ra1van2a, King of the
<>demons, by his wife Mandodari1. They were Megha-
<>na1da, Atika1ya and Aks2akuma1ra. Aks2akuma1ra was a
<>redoubtable hero and a fierce fighter but was killed by
<>Hanu1ma1n in Lan3ka1. (Sarga 47, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>AKS2A II. We find another warrior of this name among
<>the soldiers who came to help Skanda in the Kaurava-
<>Pa1n2d2ava battle. (S4loka 58, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AKS2AHR2DAYA. A sacred chant or mantra. When
<>Nala was roaming about in the forests after his separa-
<>tion from Damayanti1 he happened to save the cobra,
<>Ka1rkot2aka, from a wild fire. But in return the snake bit
<>him and made him as black as clouds. He then advised
<>Nala to go to the palace of King R2tuparn2a where the [Page023-a+ 65]
<>cobra said, Nala would be taught the secret mantra of
<>Aks2ahr2daya by the King.
<NI>One who knows this sacred chant can find out all secrets
<>of a game of dice and can count within no time the
<>number of leaves, fruits and flowers on a tree. Nala went
<>to Rt2uparn2a and stayed with him. While living there a
<>brahmin named Sudeva came to R2tuparn2a and informed
<>him that Damayanti1 was going to marry again. R2tuparn2a
<>immediately started for Vidarbha taking Nala as his
<>charioteer. The chariot driven by Nala flew like a wind
<>and on the way when R2tuparn2a's handkerchief fell down
<>and he requested Nala to stop the chariot. Nala informed
<>him that by the time the request was made they had
<>travelled already one yojana. As they proceeded they
<>saw a huge tree full of leaves and fruits. R2tuparn2a at a
<>glance told Nala that the tree contained five crores of
<>leaves and two thousand nine hund2red and five fruits.
<>Nala was surprised. Then they understood that Nala
<>was able to drive the chariot so quickly because of his
<>knowledge of the sacred chant As4vahr2daya and that
<>R2tuparn2a was able to count the leaves and fruits be-
<>cause of his knowledge of the chant Aks2ahr2daya. They
<>taught each other the sacred mantras. Because of this
<>Aks2ahr2daya Nala was able to win the game of dice the
<>second time and regain his kingdom. (Chapter 72,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>AKS2AMA1LA1 (ARUNDHATI1). See under Arundhati1.
<HI>AKS2APRAPATANA. A particular place in the country
<>of A1nartta. At this place S4ri1 Kr2sn2a killed two demons
<>named Gopati and Ta1laketu. (S4loka 29, Chapter 38,
<>Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKS2ARAPURUS2A. When all was set for the Kuru-
<>ks2etra battle Arjuna showed signs of weakness and hesi-
<>tated to proceed for a fight. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a then through the
<>famous Gi1ta1 enunciated a philosophy of life during the
<>course of which he speaks about the two purus2as, Ks2ara
<>and Aksara. All that we see in this world and enjoy are
<>Ks2ara and the power behind all of them is Aks2ara.
<>God is one who transcends the aspects Ks2ara and Aks2ara
<>and stands as the root cause of all life. (S4lokas 16 to 19,
<>Chapter 39, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.)
<HI>AKSASU1TRA1. She was the wife of the sage A1pastamba.
<>She was a very chaste woman. (See under A1pastamba).
<HI>AKS2AUHIN2I1. A big division of an army. It is described
<>in the Verses 19 to 26 in the 2nd Chapter of A1di Parva of
<>the Malayalam Maha1bha1rata. It says thus: One chariot,
<>one elephant, three horses and five soldiers constitute
<>what is termed a Patti. Three such pattis make one Sena1-
<>mukha and three such sena1mukhas make one Gulma.
<>Three gulmas make one Gan2a and three such gan2as
<>make one Va1hini1. Three such va1hini1s make one Pr2tana1.
<>An Aks2auhin2i1 contains 21870 chariots, an equal number
<>of elephants, 65160 horses and 109350 soldiers.
<HI>AKS2AYAPA1TRA. This is a copper vessel given to
<>Dharmaputra by Su1rya (Sun). To destroy the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>Duryodhana kept them in a palace made of lac. They
<>escaped from there and passing through dense forests
<>crossed the river Ganges and reached the Kingdom of
<>Pa1n5ca1la where they married the King's daughter,
<>Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1). On their way they killed two demons
<>called Hidimba and Baka. When they were living hap-
<>pily at Indraprastha the jealous Duryodhana defeated
<>them in a game of dice by foul play and sent them for a
<>period of twelve years to the forests. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>found it impossible to feed the innumerable subjects who [Page023-b+ 65]
<>faithfully followed them to the forest. Dharmaputra
<>then prayed to the God, Su1rya and he appeared before
<>him and gave him this Aks2aya Pa1tra (Aks2aya=never
<>getting empty, Pa1tra=pot). Everyday this pot never
<>got empty till the meals of Pa1n5ca1li1 were over. (Chapter
<>3, Vana Parva, M.B.). See also under Duryodhana,
<>Para 12.
<HI>AKS2AYAVAT2A. A sacred lake. When the Pa1n2d2avas
<>during their exile went to Pulastya1s4rama sage Pulastya
<>gave a description of all the sacred lakes in India. He
<>says, “After reaching Ma1rkan2d2eya lake you should visit
<>the meeting place of the rivers Gan3ga1 and Gomati1.
<>Then when you reach Gaya1 you will find there a lake
<>called Aks2ayavat2a. If you bathe in that lake you will
<>get salvation”. In the Navama Skandha of Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata you find the following about Aks2ayavat2a: “Pus2pa-
<>bhadra1 is one of the famous sacred rivers in India. This
<>river starts from the Hima1layas with the name S4ara1vati1
<>and flowing for 500 yojanas (One yojanam is equal
<>to about 8 miles) on the left side of river Gomati1 reaches
<>the western ocean. There is an a1s4rama called Aks2aya-
<>vat2a on the shores of this beautiful river which always
<>carries crystal clear water. The a1s4rama got that name
<>because of a big banyan tree standing near it. Kapila,
<>the great sage, did penance sitting here for a long time.
<>Lord S4iva, Bhadraka1li1 and Skanda used to come and
<>sit underneath this banyan tree.
<HI>AKS2I1N2A. He was the son of Vis4va1mitra. (S4loka 50,
<>Chapter 14, Anus4a1sana Parva. For more details see
<>under Vis4va1mitra).
<HI>AKU1PA1RA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} There is a lake in the Hima1-
<>layas called Indradyumna. Aku1pa1ra is a tortoise living
<>in it. There is also a statement that this is the A1di-
<>Ku1rma (second of the ten incarnations of God). A
<>description of Aku1pa1ra is found in Chapter 199 of Vana
<>Parva in Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>2) {%Ciran5ji1vi1 (One who has no death).%} When the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas were in exile in the forests sage Ma1rkan2d2eya tells
<>many stories to Dharmaputra to console him in his sad
<>plight. The Pa1n2d2avas asked Ma1rkan2d2eya whether he
<>knew of anybody living before him. Then the sage said,
<>“In times of old Indradyumna an ascetic King (Ra1jars2i)
<>fell down from heaven when he fell short of his accumu-
<>lated ‘Pun2ya’. Sorrowfully he came to me and asked me
<>whether I knew him. I replied in the negative adding
<>that perhaps Pra1vi1rakarn2a an owl living on the top of
<>the Hima1layas might know him since he was older
<>than me. At once Indradyumna became a horse and
<>taking me on its back approached the owl living in the
<>Hima1layas. The owl also could not remember Indra-
<>dyumna but directed him to a stork named Na1d2i1jam3gha
<>who was older than the owl. The Ascetic king took me
<>then to the Indradyumna lake where the stork lived.
<>The stork also could not find the identity of Indra-
<>dyumna. Perhaps he said that a tortoise of name Aku1-
<>pa1ra living in that same lake might know him. We then
<>approached the tortoise and enquired whether he knew
<>Indradyumna. The tortoise sat in meditation for some
<>time and then weeping profusely and shaking like a leaf
<>stood bowing respectfully and said, “How can I remain
<>without knowing him? There are several monuments
<>of the useful work done by him here. This very lake is of
<>his making. This came into existence by the march of
<>the cows he gave away to the people”. The moment [Page024-a+ 64]
<>the tortoise finished speaking a chariot appeared from
<>heaven to take the King away. The King after leaving
<>me and the owl in their proper places ascended to heaven
<>in the chariot.
<HI>ALAGHU. A son born to Vasis2t2ha by U1rjja1. Ra1ja
<>(Rajas) Ga1tra, Urdhvaba1hu, Savana, S4ukra and
<>Sutapas, who were great hermits, were brothers of
<>Alaghu, who has another name ‘Alagha’. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 20).
<HI>ALAKA1. The city of Kubera.
<HI>ALAKANANDA1. River Gan3ga1 of devaloka. The river
<>gan3ga1 of the earth when it flows through devaloka is
<>called Alakananda1 and is called Vaitaran2i1 when it flows
<>through Pitr2loka (nether world). Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana
<>(Vya1sa) declares that Deva Gan3ga1 with crystal pure
<>water flowing in devaloka under the name Alakananda1
<>and Vaitaran2i1 of the nether world, a terror to sinners,
<>are the same as the Gan3ga1 of the earth. (S4lokas 21 and
<>22, Chapter 170, Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, A.P.).
<NI>Starting from Vis2n2upa1da Alakananda1 flows through
<>Devaya1na which blazes with the splendour of a crore of
<>beautiful many-storeyed buildings. Flowing from there
<>to Candraman2d2ala (moon) and flooding it completely
<>flows down to Brahmaloka. From there it divides into
<>four rivulets and flows to the four different sides with
<>the names Si1ta1, Caks2us, Alakananda1 and Bhadra1. Of
<>these Si1ta1 falls on the thickly wooded mountain tops of
<>Maha1meru and flowing from there through Gandha-
<>ma1dana by the side of Bhadra1s4vavars2a falls down in the
<>eastern ocean. Caks2us falls on the top of Ma1lyava1n
<>mountain and flowing through Ketuma1la falls down in
<>the western ocean. The most sacred of the group,
<>Alakananda1, falls on the mountain of Hemaku1t2a and
<>from there flows through Bha1ratavars2a and falls down
<>in the southern ocean. The fourth, Bhadra1, falling on
<>the top of the Mountain, Sr2n3gava1n flows to the northern
<>ocean. Of these the most sacred is Alakananda1 which
<>flows through Bha1ratavars2a and it is believed that even
<>those who think of taking a bath in that will acquire the
<>benefit of performing ya1gas like As4vamedha and Ra1ja-
<>su1ya. (Eighth Skandha of S4ri1 Maha1devi1bha1gavata).
<HI>ALAMBALA. A giant who used to eat human flesh.
<>This cannibal was the son of Jat2a1sura. This asura
<>(Alambala) fought on the side of the Kauravas in the
<>Kuruks2etra battle because Bhi1masena had killed his
<>father, Jat2a1sura. In the battle, Ghat2otkaca cut off the
<>head of this mighty warrior and magician and threw his
<>head into the war-chariot of Duryodhana. (M.B., Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 149).
<HI>ALAMBATI1RTHA. A holy place where there was a
<>sacred bath. Garud2a, when he went to devaloka (the
<>realm of the gods) to bring Amr2tam (ambrosia) took
<>rest in this holy place. (See under the word Garud2a.
<>Also M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 39, Stanza 39).
<HI>ALAMBUS2A I. Son of the giant R2s2yas4r2n3ga. He had
<>fought on the side of the Kauravas. (M.B., Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 167, Stanza 33). There was a combat between
<>Alambus2a and Ghat2otkaca, on the first day of the battle
<>of Kuruks2etra.
<NI>“Alambus2a shot ninety sharpened pointed arrows at the

<HI>ALAMBUS2A1. A celestial woman born to Kas4yapa by

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Begins from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order: Brahma1-Kas4yapa-Alambus2a1.
<NI>2) {%How she enticed the hermit Dadhi1ca.%} In days of yore
<>there was an ascetic named Dadhi1ca. He began doing
<>tapas on the bank of the river Sarasvati1. Indra was in
<>consternation. Indra sent this celestial maid Alambus2a1
<>to entice the hermit. When the ascetic got down to the
<>river, Alambus2a1 approached him with enticing actions
<>and expressions. When the hermit saw her he became
<>passionate and he had seminal flow. The sperm fell
<>into the river. The river became pregnant and delivered
<>a child in due course. He was called Sa1rasvata.
<NI>Alambus2a1 brought the child before Dadhi1ca, who blessed
<>the child and said that there would be a drought in the
<>country continuously for twelve years and that at that
<>juncture Sa1rasvata would recite passages from the
<>Scripture to the Brahmins who had forgotten them. The
<>much pleased Sarasvati1 and Sa1rasvata went back.
<NI>At that time Indra lost his Vajra1yudha (weapon of
<>thunderbolt) somewhere. The Asuras (enemies of
<>Gods) made an onslaught on the gods and their realm.
<>Indra knew that with a weapon made by the bone of
<>Dadhi1ca the Asuras could be destroyed. Indra asked the
<>Gods to bring the bone. They came down to the earth
<>and requested Dadhi1ca to give them a bone. Dadhi1ca
<>giving his bone died and attained heaven. With his
<>bones Indra made a good deal of weapons such as the
<>Vajra1yudha, wheel weapons, maces and sticks and with
<>them Indra slew all the Daityas (Asuras).
<NI>After this there was a great famine in the country. As
<>there was no rain, crops failed and lands became dry and
<>the Brahmins left the country. Sa1rasvata alone remained
<>with his mother. After twelve years the famine and
<>starvation came to an end. By then the Brahmins had
<>forgotten the hymns and mantras of the Vedas. They
<>approached the boy Sa1rasvata and renewed their me-
<>mory. (Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51).
<NI>3) {%Punarjanma (Rebirth).%} Long ago Indra went to
<>Brahma1. There was one Vasu called Vidhu1ma also with
<>Indra. When these two were standing near Brahma1,
<>Alambus2a1 also came there to pay homage to Brahma1.
<>The garments she had on were displaced by wind.
<>Vidhu1ma saw the dazzling beauty of her body and was
<>overpowered by libido. Alambus2a1 who understood
<>this, was filled with passion for him. Brahma1 who saw
<>the changes in them looked at Indra with displeasure.
<>Indra knowing the mind of Brahma1 cursed them: “Both
<>of you who have lost meekness shall become human be- [Page025-a+ 65]
<>ings and then your desire will be fulfilled”. Owing to
<>the curse Vidhu1ma was born as Sahasra1ni1ka, the illus-
<>trious King of Candra vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty) and
<>Alambus2a1 took birth as Mr2ga1vati1, the daughter of King
<>Kr2tavarma1 and his wife Kala1vati1. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Katha1mukhalambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<NI>4) {%The curse of Tilottama1.%} Sahasra1ni1ka the incarnation
<>of Vidhu1ma and Mr2ga1vati1 the incarnation of Alambus2a1
<>fell in love with each other on the earth also. Before
<>the wedding took place Devendra once invited Sahasra1-
<>ni1ka to heaven. He lived there for a time as the guest
<>of the Gods. After having defeated the Asuras it was
<>time for him to return. Indra sent Tilottama1 to keep
<>company. The charioteer was driving. Sahasra1ni1ka
<>immersed in the thought of Mr2ga1vati1 was sitting silent.
<>Tilottama1 said something which the King did not hear.
<>Tilottama1 cursed him that he would be separated for
<>fourteen years from the object about which he was
<>thinking. He was not even aware of the curse.
<NI>5) {%The period of separation.%} The King returned to
<>Kaus4a1mbi his capital city. Without much delay the
<>wedding ceremony also was conducted. She became
<>pregnant. One day she told her lover-husband that she
<>had a desire to dip in a blood pond. The King made a
<>pond and filled it with a solution of La1ks2a1 (wax, when
<>dissolved in water, the water will look like blood) and
<>such other substances. Mr2ga1vati1 was dipping and splash-
<>ing in it when an eagle taking her to be a piece of flesh
<>took her away. At the loss of his wife Sahasra1ni1ka lost
<>his senses and fell down unconscious. Immediately
<>Ma1tali, Indra's charioteer, came down from the realm of
<>Gods and brought the King back to consciousness, and
<>then informing him of the curse of Tilottama1 he returned.
<>Without paying any heed to the consolatory words of
<>his ministers or other inmates of the palace the King
<>went on lamenting and moaning, “ha, my love Mr2ga1-
<>vati1! Where are you now?” and waited for the end of
<>the period of the curse, execrating Tilottama1. Casting
<>Mr2ga1vati1 on the Mountain of the Rising Sun the great
<>bird flew away. The horror-stricken queen, thinking of
<>her present condition cried aloud. A very large mountain
<>snake began to draw near to swallow her. A divine
<>person saved her from that situation and vanished. The
<>unprotected Mr2ga1vati1 decided to commit suicide. It
<>was a forest which abounded in lions, tigers, bears and
<>such other ferocious animals. But none of them came
<>near her; over and above the exertion of carrying, she
<>had to bear the difficulties of her forlorn condition, and
<>she grew weary and worn and became unconscious.
<>Then a hermit boy came there and questioned her who
<>was now lean and ill-dressed, about her condition and
<>consoling her guided her to the hermitage of the great
<>hermit Jamadagni. When she saw the hermit who was
<>as radiant as the Sun, she bowed low before him. “My
<>daughter! Don't fear. You will get a heroic son here who
<>will continue your family. You will be reunited to your
<>husband.” Said the great and noble hermit, who could
<>foresee the future. Somewhat pacified Mr2ga1vati1 lived
<>in that hermitage waiting for reunion with her husband.
<>After some days she gave birth to a son who had all the
<>symptoms of greatness. At the birth of the child Mr2ga1-
<>vati1 heard an unknown voice saying, “This boy would
<>become the great and renowned King Udayana. His son
<>would get the leadership of the Vidya1dharas (the musi-
<>cians of the Gods)”. At this the queen was immensely [Page025-b+ 65]
<>pleased. The boy Udayana grew up in the hermitage,
<>an incarnation of all good qualities. The hermit to whom
<>the past, the present and the future were not obscure,
<>performed the necessary rites and rituals becoming a
<>Ks2atriya boy (Ruling caste) and taught him everything
<>including the Dhanurveda (the Science of Archery).
<>As a token of her intense love for the son, she put a bangle
<>with the name of Sahasra1ni1ka inscribed on the arm of
<>Udayana. One day when Udayana was tramping the
<>forest, he saw a snake-charmer catching a snake. Seeing
<>the beauty of the snake he asked the snake-charmer to let
<>the snake free. But the snake-charmer replied, “Oh
<>Prince, this is my daily bread. I earn my livelihood by
<>exhibiting snakes. My previous snake was dead and it
<>was with the help of a good deal of herbs and spells and
<>incantations that I caught this one”.
<NI>When he heard this Udayana felt pity for him and gave
<>the bangle to the snake-charmer and let the snake free.
<>When the snake-charmer had gone with the bangle,
<>the snake beaming with joy said to Udayana: “I am
<>Vasunemi, the elder brother of Va1suki. I am grateful to
<>you for giving me freedom. I give you this lute producing
<>exquisite notes of music, betels and some tricks to pre-
<>pare never fading garlands and paste to make marks on
<>the forehead. Receive them as my presents”. Udayana
<>accepted the presents with gladness and returned more
<>luminous than before to the hermitage of Jamadagni.
<>The snake-charmer took the bangle, given by Udayana
<>to the bazar for sale. The police caught him and took
<>him before the King, because they saw the name of the
<>King inscribed on the bangle. The King asked him how
<>he got the bangle and the snake-charmer told the King
<>the story from the catching of the snake till he got the
<>bangle. “This is the bangle that I put on the arm of my
<>wife. The boy who gave this bangle to this snake-charmer
<>must be my son.” The King was thinking with sadness,
<>when the King heard a voice from above say, “O King!
<>the period of the curse is over. Your wife and son are
<>in the Mountain of the Rising Sun”. At these words the
<>King felt extreme joy. Somehow or other he spent the
<>rest of the day. Early the next morning the King follow-
<>ed by his army, went to the Mountain of the Rising Sun
<>to bring back his wife and son. They took the snake-
<>charmer to show them the way.
<NI>In due course the King and his train reached the holy
<>hermitage of the eminent hermit Jamadagni. The place
<>was always vibrant with sounds of the repeating and reci-
<>tation of the Holy scriptures and covered with smoke
<>mingled with the fragrance of burning herbs and other
<>oblations burned in the sacrificial fire. The various wild
<>animals which are born enemies of each other got on
<>amicably there. The hermit who was an incarnation of
<>the higher aspirations greeted the King who was the
<>protector of the ascetics, with the hospitality becoming
<>his status. The King who saw Mr2ga1vati1 with their son
<>was overcome with gladness. Their reunion caused a
<>shower of Ambrosia (Amr2ta). The King stood before
<>the hermit with folded arms and bowed head for per-
<>mission to depart. To the King the hermit Jamadagni
<>said: “Oh, King, you are welcome to this hermitage.
<>To those such as you who are of the ‘Rajogun2apradha1na’
<>caste (Ruling race) the peaceful atmosphere of our
<>hermitage may not be appealing to the heart. But a holy
<>hermitage is more respectable than the palace of an
<>Emperor. There is no place for unhappiness here. You [Page026-a+ 63]
<>might have known that the reason for your separation
<>is a curse. When you were returning from heaven with
<>Tilottama1, you were so much engrossed in the thought of
<>Mr2ga1vati1 that you did not pay any heed to the conver-
<>sation of Tilottama1. She was displeased with your be-
<>haviour and cursed you. In future, if ever you happen to
<>get into a position which will cause you mental trouble
<>you can be assured of the presence of this Jamadagni.”
<>The King said, “I am extremely grateful to your Emi-
<>nence for this great boon. I am fully aware of the fact
<>that the presence of the holy hermits who have under
<>their control the eightfold prosperities, is always a
<>harbinger of peace and prosperity. I am very sorry to
<>say that the exigency of my presence at the capital due to
<>the pressure of work in connection with the ruling of the
<>country compels me to cut short my visit to this holy
<>hermitage. I shall be looking forward with pleasure to
<>occasions which will enable me to pay visits to this Holy
<>abode.”
<NI>Much pleased at the speech of the King the hermit said
<>to Mr2ga1vati1: “My daughter! Not only myself, but all
<>the inmates of this hermitage are highly pleased at
<>having got you in our midst for so long. We are sorry to
<>part from you. Now look! the animals of the hermitage
<>are standing round you and shedding tears. Still we are
<>consoled at your reunion with your husband. Naturally
<>you are of a very good character and your life in this
<>hermitage has given you a nice training and so there is no
<>need for any more advice from me at this time.”
<NI>Saying this he drew Udayana to his side, kissed him on
<>his head and said to the King again: “This son is a deco-
<>ration to your dynasty. This handsome boy has been
<>taught everything becoming a royal prince. Let him be a
<>costly gem to you”.
<NI>Thus blessing the boy the hermit led him to the King.
<>The joy at her r{??}nion with husband, her shyness at
<>being near him, her sorrow at having to depart from the
<>hermitage and the surging feeling in her mind--all
<>these made her dumb and so being unable to say any-
<>thing she expressed her love and regard for the hermit
<>whom she loved as her father, by some motions of her
<>body and took leave of him with her son. The blessed
<>King and his train, looking at the men, beasts and birds
<>which accompanied them for a while, took leave of them
<>and proceeded to the capital city. On reaching there
<>the King anointed his son Udayana as King. Sahasra1-
<>nika then went to the Hima1layas to practise ascesis with
<>his wife. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka,
<>Taran3ga 2).

<>with his own name to be living in this world. So he
<>killed the king. After that Vicitravi1rya became king.
<>Bhi1s2ma had to take up the task of arranging a suitable
<>marriage for Vicitravi1rya.
<NI>2) {%The Svayam3vara.%} It was at this time that Bhi1s2ma
<>came to know that the King of Ka1s4i1 was arranging the
<>Svayam3vara of his three daughters, Amba1, Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1. Bhi1s2ma went there and in the presence of all
<>the kings who had assembled there, took the three
<>princesses with him to Hastina1pura. There he made all
<>preparations for the marriage. But as the time for the
<>ceremony approached, the eldest and most beautiful of
<>the princesses, Amba1 went to Bhi1s2ma and said: “I had
<>already made up my mind long ago to marry Sa1lva, the
<>King. Besides, we are deeply in love with each other.
<>Therefore, please consider whether it is proper on the
<>part of a great man like you to force me into another
<>marriage.”
<NI>On hearing this, Bhi1s2ma allowed her to do as she liked.
<>Amba1 then went to King Sa1lva and made an appeal to
<>him to accept her as his wife since they were mutually
<>in love.
<NI>3) {%Sa1lva's rejection.%} To her words Sa1lva replied:
<>“What you have said about our mutual love is true. But
<>it is not right for a man to accept a woman who has been
<>accepted by another. I saw Bhi1s2ma taking you by hand
<>and helping you into his chariot. Therefore go at once
<>to Bhi1s2ma himself and ask him to accept you.” Stunned
<>by his words, she turned away, to go to the forest to do
<>penance.
<NI>4) {%Revenge on Bhi1s2ma.%} In the Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 17, we find that Amba1 had cherished a
<>secret desire to wreak vengeance on Bhi1s2ma. She went to
<>the A1s4rama of S4aikha1vatya Muni in the forest and stayed
<>there for the night. Her wish to do penance was approv-
<>ed by the Muni. On the next day, Amba1's maternal
<>grandfather, Hotrava1hana (Sr2n5jaya) came that way.
<>Hotrava1hana came to know of all her misfortunes. He
<>advised her to inform Paras4ura1ma of all her grievances.
<>Just at that moment Akr2tavran2a, a follower of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma happened to come there. Hotrava1hana introduced
<>Amba1 to Akr2tavran2a. Both Akr2tavran2a and Sr2n5jaya
<>explained all her affairs to Paras4ura1ma. Paras4ura1ma
<>undertook to persuade Bhi1s2ma to accept Amba1 (as his
<>wife). But Paras4ura1ma's proposal was turned down by
<>Bhi1s2ma. A terrible duel took place between them at
<>Kuruks2etra. When the fight reached a critical stage,
<>Na1rada and the gods induced Paras4ura1ma to withdraw
<>from the duel. Thus the fight ended with equal victory
<>to both. Finding that it was not possible to achieve her
<>object through Paras4ura1ma's mediation, Amba1 re-
<>nounced food, sleep etc. and went to the Yamuna1 valley
<>to do penance for six years. (M.B., Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 188). After that for one year she went on a
<>fast, lying under the water in the river Yamuna1. Again
<>for another year she did penance, standing on the tip of
<>the toes and eating only dry leaves. Next, she reduced
<>the sky and earth to flames by doing penance. The
<>goddess Gan3ga1 appeared to her and when she under-
<>stood her plight, she told Amba1 that it was not possible
<>to kill Bhi1s2ma. In her agony and despair, without even
<>drinking water, she wandered about here and there.
<>The goddess Ganga1 cursed her to become a river in the
<>Vatsa country. As a result of the curse, a part of her was
<>turned into the river known as Amba1. [Page028-b+ 65]
<NI>5) {%S4iva's Boon.%} The remaining part of her engaged
<>itself in penance. S4iva appeared to her and told her that
<>in the next birth she would attain masculinity. He added
<>that she would be born in the Drupada dynasty as a
<>great archer under the name of Citrayodhi and kill
<>Bhi1s2ma. Pleased with this prophecy, she took a vow that
<>she would kill Bhi1s2ma and making a pyre, burnt herself
<>to death.
<NI>6) {%Rebirth.%} King Drupada's queen had been in great
<>distress for a long time because she had no children.
<>Drupada propitiated S4iva by worshipping him for an
<>issue. S4iva blessed him and said that a girl would be
<>born to him, but she would be transformed into a boy.
<>In due course, the queen gave birth to a girl, but it was
<>announced that it was a boy. Therefore the child had to
<>be brought up, dressed like a boy. The child became
<>famous under the name of S4ikhan2d2i1. When S4ikhan2d2i1
<>attained youth, Drupada decided to look for a wife for
<>him (her?). Still he was greatly perplexed as to how to
<>find a wife for S4ikhan2d2i1 who was already a youthful
<>virgin! But his wife assured Drupada that Sikhan2d2i1
<>would become a man, according to S4iva's blessing. So,
<>Drupada made a proposal for S4ikhan2d2i1's marriage with
<>the daughter of the King of Das4a1rn2a.
<NI>7) {%S4ikhan2d2i1's Marriage.%} Hiran2yavarn2a, the King of
<>Das4a1rn2a, gave his daughter in marriage to S4ikhan2d2i1.
<>The couple arrived at Ka1mbalyapura. By this time the
<>wife came to know that the “husband” was a woman.
<>She disclosed the secret to her Ladies-in-waiting. They
<>in turn communicated it to the king. Enraged at this,
<>Hiran2yavarn2a sent a messenger to King Drupada to
<>ascertain the truth of the matter. He even began to
<>make preparations for waging a war against Drupada,
<>King of Pan5ca1la. Drupada and his queen were in a fix.
<>At this stage the distressed S4ikhan2d2i1 proceeded to the
<>forest, determined to commit suicide. People were
<>afraid of entering that forest because a Yaks2a named
<>Sthu1n2akarn2a lived there. S4ikhan2d2i1 went to the premises
<>of the Yaks2a and performed certain rites for a number of
<>days. The Yaks2a appeared to her. S4ikhan2d2i1 explained
<>the whole matter to him. They entered into a contract.
<>According to it, they exchanged their sexes--S4ikhan2d2i1
<>receiving the male sex of the Yaks2a and the Yaks2a receiv-
<>ing the female sex of S4ikhan2d2i1. S4ikhan2d2i1 returned home
<>as a man. Drupada repeated with greater force his old
<>plea that his child was a man. Hiran2yavarn2a made a
<>thorough examination of S4ikhan2d2i1 and convinced him-
<>self of the truth. Many years after, Hiran2yavarn2a died.
<NI>8) {%Kubera's Arrival.%} At that time, in the course of his
<>world tour Kubera arrived at the residence of Sthu1n2a-
<>karn2a. The Yaks2a who was in female form, did not
<>come out to receive Kubera. In his anger, Kubera
<>pronounced a curse that the female sex of Sthu1n2akarn2a
<>and the male sex of S4ikhan2d2i1 would continue for ever.
<>The Yaks2a prayed for the lifting of the curse. Kubera
<>released him from the curse by saying that after the
<>death of S4ikhan2d2i1, the Yaks2a would be restored to his
<>own male sex.
<NI>According to the previous agreement, S4ikhan2d2i1 went to
<>Sthu1n2akarn2a's place after the death of Hiran2yavarn2a.
<>But coming to know of all that had happened, he return-
<>ed home. Thus S4ikhan2d2i1 became a man permanently.
<>S4ikhan2d2i1 had received his training in arms under Dron2a1-
<>ca1rya. In the great Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava battle, he became
<>a charioteer. [Page029-a+ 61]
<NI>9) {%S4ikhan2d2i1's Revenge.%} The Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 108, describes Bhi1s2ma's encounter with
<>S4ikhan2d2i1 during the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava battle. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas started the day's battle by keeping S4ikhan2d2i1
<>in the vanguard. Bhi1ma, Arjuna, Abhimanyu and other
<>warriors were giving him support. It was Bhi1s2ma who
<>led the Kaurava forces. Arrows began to fly from both
<>sides. It was the tenth day of the battle and S4ikhan2d2i1
<>shot three arrows aimed at Bhi1s2ma's breast. Bhi1s2ma
<>with a smile of contempt said to S4ikhan2d2i1, “S4ikhan2d2i1!
<>Brahma1 created you as a woman. You may do as you
<>like”. Hearing this taunt, S4ikhan2d2i1 became more in-
<>furiated. Arjuna inspired him with greater courage.
<>After that, keeping S4ikhan2d2i1 in front, Arjuna began to
<>fight with Bhi1s2ma. S4ikhan2d2i1 also showered his arrows
<>on him. Ten of these arrows of S4ikhan2d2i1 hit Bhi1s2ma's
<>breast. Bhi1s2ma disregarded even those arrows. At last
<>he said: “I cannot kill the Pa1n2d2avas because they are
<>invulnerable (avadhya1h2). I cannot kill S4ikhan2d2i1 be-
<>cause he is really a woman and not man. Though I am
<>also invulnerable and cannot be killed in battle, yet
<>today I have to die; the time has come for me to die.”
<>Meanwhile S4ikhan2d2i1 and Arjuna were discharging a
<>continuous and heavy shower of arrows at Bhi1s2ma. At
<>last Bhi1s2ma fell down. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>173).
<HI>AMBA1JANMA. It is a place of sacred bath where the
<>sage Na1rada usually resides. Those who die here will
<>attain salvation (Moks2a) by Na1rada's blessing, accord-
<>ing to M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse 81.
<HI>AMBA1LIKA1. (1) The youngest of the three daughters
<>of the King of Ka1s4i1--Amba1, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1.
<>Vicitravi1rya, son of S4antanu married Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1. The mother of this princess was Kausalya1.
<NI>2) {%Pa1n2d2u's Mother.%} Vicitravi1rya died before children
<>were born to his wives. To avoid the extinction of the
<>family, Satyavati1, mother of Vicitravi1rya summoned
<>Vya1sa, her other son and asked him to beget a son for
<>Ambika1. Vya1sa obeyed his mother half-heartedly.
<>Ambika1 did not like the dark-complexioned, crudely
<>attired Vya1sa. Still owing to the Mother's pressure, she
<>passively submitted to the act. As a result of their union
<>was born Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who was blind from his birth. The
<>grief-stricken mother called Vya1sa again and asked him
<>to have union with Amba1lika1 this time. As Amba1lika1's
<>face was pale at the time of their union, a child with
<>pale complexion was born to her. He was named Pa1n2d2u.
<>Having thus failed in both attempts, Satyavati1 asked
<>Ambika1 to go to Vya1sa again. At night Ambika1 secretly
<>disguised her waiting-maid and sent her in her own
<>place, to Vya1sa. The waiting-maid experienced exquisite
<>pleasure in Vya1sa's company and as a result a most
<>intelligent son was born to her. It was he who became
<>the renowned Vidura. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 106).
<HI>AMBARI1S2A I. A King of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Vis2n2u was born in the
<>following order: Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa.-Vivasva1n-
<>Vaivasvatamanu-Iks2va1ku-Vikuks2i-S4as4a1da-Puran5jaya-
<>Kukutstha-Anenas-Pr2thula1s4va-Prasenajit-Yuvana1s4va-
<>Ma1ndha1ta1-Ambari1s2a. Ma1ndha1ta1 had three sons: Amba-
<>ri1s2a, Mucukunda and Purukutsa and fifty daughters. [Page029-b+ 64]
<>The Muni (Sage) Saubhari married the daughters.
<NI>2) {%Ambari1s2a's Ya1ga (sacrifice).%} In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a
<>there is a story of Devendra's theft of the sacrificial
<>cow from Ambari1s2a's ya1gas4a1la1. Devendra could not
<>bear the thought of King Ambari1s2a winning world-
<>renown and glory by performing ya1gas. Therefore Indra
<>stole the sacrificial cow and took it away. The Upa1-
<>dhya1ya (Chief Priest) was alarmed at the disappear-
<>ance of the cow and expressed his opinion to the King
<>that it would be enough to sacrifice a human being in-
<>stead of the cow. The King searched for the cow in all
<>countries, cities and forests. At last he reached the
<>peak of Bhr2gutun3ga where the sage R2ci1ka lived with
<>his wife and children. The King explained to the sage
<>the whole story. He requested him to sell one of his sons
<>in exchange for 100,000 cows. R2ci1ka had three sons.
<>The eldest was his father's favourite and the youngest
<>was the mother's pet. In the end, R2ci1ka sold the second
<>son, S4unas4s4epha in return for 100,000 cows.
<NI>On his return journey with S4unas4s4epha the king rested
<>for a while at Pus2kara Ti1rtha. There S4unas4s4epha
<>happened to meet his uncle Vis4va1mitra and complain-
<>ed to him about his sad plight. S4unas4s4epha's wish was
<>that the king's ya1ga should be performed and at the same
<>time his own life-span should be extended. Vis4va1mitra
<>promised to save S4unas4s4epha. He called Madhu-
<>cchandas and his other sons and said to them: “One of
<>you must take the place of Ambari1s2a's sacrificial cow
<>and save the life of S4unas4s4epha. God will bless you.”
<NI>But none of the sons of Vis4va1mitra was prepared to
<>become the sacrificial cow. Vis4va1mitra uttered a curse
<>on his sons that they would have to spend a thousand
<>years on earth, eating dog-flesh. Then he turned to
<>S4unas4s4epha and told him that if he prayed to the gods
<>at the time of Ambari1s2a's yajn5a, they would save him.
<NI>So S4unas4s4epha went to Ambari1s2a's ya1gas4a1la1. As
<>ordered by the assembled guests, Ambari1s2a bound
<>S4unas4s4epha and had him dressed in blood-red robes,
<>ready for the sacrifice. S4unas4s4epha began to praise and
<>pray to the gods. Soon Indra appeared and blessed him
<>with longevity. He also rewarded Ambari1s2a for his
<>ya1ga. Thus S4unas4s4epha was saved.
<F>*) The story of S4unas4s4epha may be seen with slight variations in the Devi1 Bha1gavata and other Pura1n2as. In those versions, S4unas4s4epha
<>has been described as the sacrificial cow at Haris4candra's ya1ga, and moreover, Aji1garta is referred to as the father of S4unas4s4epha. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 58 gives the same story as in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).</F> (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 61).
<NI>3) {%Ambari1s2a and Durva1sas.%} In Bha1gavata we see a story
<>which describes how the Sudars4ana Cakra which emerg-
<>ed from Ambari1s2a's forehead chased Durva1sas in all
<>the three worlds. Ambari1s2a was a devout worshipper of
<>Vis2n2u. From the very beginning of his reign, peace and
<>prosperity spread all over the country. Maha1vis2n2u
<>who was pleased with the deep piety and devotion of
<>Ambari1s2a appeared to him and bestowed on him the
<>control of his (Vis2n2u's) Sudars4ana Cakra. After that
<>Ambari1s2a started the observance of Eka1das4i1 vrata.
<>The rigour of the observance alarmed even Indra. He
<>decided to obstruct the observance somehow or other. At
<>that time, Durva1sas arrived in devaloka. Indra insti-
<>gated Durva1sas to spoil the Eka1das4i1 observance of
<>Ambari1s2a.
<NI>Durva1sas went to Ambari1s2a's palace. There the King
<>received him with due respect and sent him to the river
<>Ka1lindi1 for his bath and morning rites. Durva1sas went [Page030-a+ 65]
<>for his bath and deliberately stayed away till the con-
<>clusion of Ambari1s2a's Eka1das4i1 observance. At the end
<>of the observance, after feeding the gods with his
<>offerings, Ambari1s2a kept the remaining portion for
<>Durva1sas. After his bath etc., Durva1sas returned, but
<>he was furious when he was offered the leavings of the
<>food of the gods and refused to take any food. In his
<>anger he advanced towards Ambari1s2a. A terrible mons-
<>ter Kr2tya1 emanated from the Mahars2i and was about
<>to destroy Ambari1s2a. Ambari1s2a at once called upon
<>Sudars4ana Cakra, which appeared instantly and after
<>cutting the throat of Kr2tya1, turned against Durva1sas.
<>Terrified by it, Durva1sas began to flee for life. The
<>Cakra pursued him at his heels. Durva1sas went to Indra
<>and sought refuge with him. But the Cakra followed
<>him there. Indra pleaded helplessness. Then the
<>Mahars2i went to Brahma1 and sued for his help. There
<>also the Cakra pursued him. Brahma1 sent him to S4iva.
<>S4iva was also unable to give him shelter. Sudars4ana con-
<>tinued to chase him. Durva1sas then sought shelter with
<>Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u told him plainly that there was
<>no alternative but to go and sue for mercy to Amba-
<>ri1s2a himself and advised him to do so. At last Durva1sas
<>returned to Ambari1s2a and begged his pardon. Ambari1s2a
<>saved him from Sudars4ana Cakra and described to him
<>the glory resulting from the observance of Eka1das4i1
<>vrata. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>4) {%Other Details%} (1) Ambari1s2a performed a ya1ga in

<>Verse 12; Udyoga Parva, Chapter 71, Verse 11).
<HI>AMITRAJIT. A King. In his country there were innu-
<>merable S4iva temples. Na1rada Muni who was delighted
<>by this sight, went to the Palace and said to Amitrajit:
<>“In the city of Campaka1vati1 there is a Gandharva
<>virgin named Malayagandhini1. She has been abducted
<>by Kan3ka1laketu, a Ra1ks2asa. She has promised to marry
<>the person who will rescue her from him. Therefore

<>24).
<HI>AMOGHA1. S4antanu Mahars2i's wife. Once Brahma1
<>visited S4antanu Mahars2i's A1s4rama. As the Mahars2i was [Page031-a+ 65]
<>not at home, it was Amogha1 who received the guest
<>with due reverence. Fascinated by the irresistible
<>charm of Amogha1, Brahma1 had an involuntary emis-
<>sion of seminal fluid. He felt ashamed of his own weak-
<>ness and left the A1s4rama immediately. The Mahars2i
<>who returned to the A1s4rama soon after, came to know
<>from his wife whose semen it was. He asked Amogha1 to
<>accept Brahma Deva's precious semen and not to let it
<>be wasted. Being a devoted wife, she accepted it, but
<>unable to bear the divine pregnancy, she deposited it
<>in the water lying in the valley of the Yugandhara
<>mountain. From that time, it became a place of holy
<>bath, known as Lohita. It was by bathing in this holy
<>water that Paras4ura1ma washed away his sin of annihi-
<>lating the Ks2atriyas. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a, 55).
<HI>AMPIT2T2A. A name for barbers. ‘Ampit2t2a’ is derived from
<>the Sanskrit word “Ambis2t2hah2”. The word Ambis2t2hah2
<>means Physician. In olden days barbers were physicians
<>also. Going about from house to house, they could easily
<>practise both these professions. Since barbers practised
<>physic also they were called Ambis2t2has. Ampit2t2a is a
<>corrupted form of Ambis2t2ha. (Dravidian Philology).
<NI>Barbers sometimes style themselves as “Pandits”. It
<>is on the basis of this that we have today, “All Kerala
<>Pandit Sabha” and other similar names. There is a
<>legend on the basis of which this community has assum-
<>ed the title of “Pandit”.
<NI>Long ago when S4ri1 Buddha was about to go to the
<>forest for performing Tapas, thousands of people flocked
<>together to have his dars4ana. Buddha wished to continue
<>his journey after shaving his head. Buddha asked loudly
<>whether anyone in the crowd was prepared to shave
<>his head. Only a single man came forward cheerfully to
<>do that work. Buddha turned to him and said: “My
<>dear friend, you are the only Pandit in this crowd. You
<>have the wisdom to understand that there is nothing
<>disgraceful in shaving one's head.”
<NI>He shaved Buddha's head. From that day his descen-
<>dants came to be known as “Pandits”.
<HI>AMR2TA1. Daughter of a King of Magadha. She was the
<>wife of Anas4va and mother of Pari1ks2it. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 41).
<HI>AMR2TAM. (See PRA1MR2TAM).
<HI>AMR2TAM. A delicious and precious food obtained from
<>the ocean of Milk when the Devas and Asuras churned
<>it. In Chapter 152 of Agni Pura1n2a, the word “Mr2tam”
<>is defined as wealth received by begging and “Amr2tam”
<>as wealth received without begging, and “Pra1mr2tam”
<>as another kind of wealth obtained without begging.
<NI>1) {%Cause of Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam.%} (Churning of the Sea
<>of Milk)--Once when Mahars2i Durva1sas was travelling
<>through a forest, he met the Apsara1 woman, Menaka1,
<>with a garland of Kalpaka flowers in her hand. The
<>fragrance of the flowers filled the whole forest. Durva1sas
<>approached Menaka1 and requested her to give the gar-
<>land to him. The Vidya1dhari1 (Apsara1 woman) prostrat-
<>ed before the Mahars2i with reverence and presented
<>the garland to him. Wearing that garland on his hair,
<>Durva1sas went to devaloka.
<NI>There he saw Indra riding on his elephant, Aira1vata,
<>accompanied by his retinue of Devas. The Mahars2i took
<>the rare garland from his head and presented it to
<>Indra, the King of Devas. Indra received the garland
<>and placed it on Aira1vata's head. The elephant was
<>attracted by the fragrance of the garland and took it in [Page031-b+ 65]
<>its trunk, examined it by smelling it and then threw it
<>on the ground.
<NI>Durva1sas, who became angry at the way in which his
<>garland was slighted by Indra said to him: “Since
<>you have treated my garland with disrespect, the glory
<>and prosperity of devaloka will perish!” On hearing
<>the curse, Indra alighted from the elephant, frightened.
<>He begged pardon of the Mahars2i. The furious Muni
<>continued: “I am not soft-hearted; nor am I of a for-
<>giving nature. Other Munis may forgive. Remember, I
<>am Durva1sas. You have become so haughty because
<>other Munis like Vasis2t2ha and Gautama have been flat-
<>tering you too much.” Having said this Durva1sas went
<>his way. Indra returned to Amara1vati1.
<NI>From that day the glory of devaloka began to decline.
<>The three worlds became dull. Even the plants and
<>shrubs began to wither. The performance of ya1gas came
<>to an end. The Devas began to be affected by the
<>infirmities of old age. Taking advantage of this situation,
<>the Asuras started preparations for opposing the Devas.
<>Under the oppression of the Asuras, the Devas groaned
<>in distress. Led by Agni Deva they sought refuge under
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 led them to Maha1vis2n2u. They all join-
<>ed in praising Vis2n2u who appeared and told them like
<>this: “O Gods! I shall enhance your glory. Do as I
<>tell you. Along with the Asuras bring all kinds of medi-
<>cinal herbs and deposit them in the ocean of Milk.
<>Obtain Amr2tam from it by churning it with Maha1meru
<>as the churning staff and Va1suki as the rope. The
<>Amr2tam (Amr2ta) which will be produced by churning
<>the Milk sea, will make you strong and deathless. I
<>shall see that the Asuras will share in your troubles but
<>not in enjoying Amr2tam.”
<NI>2) {%Churning of the Milk Sea.%} After Vis2n2u had vanished,
<>the Devas made a treaty with the Asuras and began to
<>work for getting Amr2tam. All of them joined together
<>in bringing various kinds of medicinal herbs and after
<>putting them in the Milk sea which was as clear as the
<>cloudless sky, began to churn it, using Manthara Moun-
<>tain as the churning staff and snake Va1suki as the rope.
<>The party of Devas was posted at the tail-end of Va1suki
<>while the Asuras took their stand at the head. The
<>Asuras became enervated by the fiery breath coming out
<>of Va1suki's mouth. The clouds which were blown by
<>that breath invigorated the Devas.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u transformed himself into a tortoise, and
<>sitting in the middle of the Milk Sea served as the
<>foundation for the Manthara Mountain, the churning
<>staff. Assuming another form, invisible both to Devas
<>and Asuras, Maha1vis2n2u pressed down the Manthara
<>Mountain from above.
<NI>While churning the Milk Sea like this, the first object
<>that rose to the surface was Ka1madhenu. Both Devas
<>and Asuras were strongly attracted towards Ka1madhenu
<>While all were standing spellbound, Va1run2i1devi1 with
<>her enchanting dreamy eyes next appeared on the sur-
<>face. Pa1rija1tam was the third to appear. Fourth, a group
<>of Apsara1 women of marvellous beauty floated up. The
<>Moon appeared as the fifth. S4iva received the Moon.
<>The venom which came out of the Milk Sea as the
<>sixth item, was absorbed by Na1gas. After that arose
<>Bhagava1n Dhanvantari, dressed in pure white robes
<>and carrying a Kaman2d2alu in his hand filled with
<>Amr2tam. All were delighted at this sight. Next Maha1-
<>laks2mi1 made her appearance in all her glory with a [Page032-a+ 65]
<>lotus in her hand and seated in an open lotus flower.
<>Gandharvas sang celestial songs in her presence;
<>Apsara1 women danced. For her bath, the Gan3ga1 river
<>arrived there with her tributaries. The Milk Sea itself
<>took on physical form and offered her a garland of ever-
<>fresh lotus flowers. Brahma1 bedecked her with orna-
<>ments. After that Laks2mi1devi1, fully adorned in all her
<>magnificent jewels, in the presence of all Devas, joined
<>the bosom of Maha1vis2n2u. The Asuras were displeased
<>at it. They snatched the pot of Amr2tam from Dhan-
<>vantari and fled away.
<NI>3) {%How Amr2tam was recovered.%} With the loss of Amr2tam,
<>the Devas were in a fix. They began to consider how
<>the pot of Amr2tam could be recovered. Accordingly
<>Maha1vis2n2u transformed himself into a celestial virgin,
<>Mohini1, of extraordinary beauty. She approached the
<>Asuras as a shy girl. The Asuras were enchanted by
<>her surpassing beauty. They asked her, “Who are
<>you?” Looking down on the ground, Mohini1 replied:
<>“I am the little sister of Dhanvantari. By the time I
<>came out of the Milk Sea, the Devas and Asuras had
<>already gone. Being lonely I am going about in search
<>of a suitable mate.”
<NI>On hearing her words, the Asuras began to make
<>friends with her one by one, determined not to waste
<>this opportunity. They told her that she should distri-
<>bute Amr2tam to all of them and in the end she should
<>marry one of them. Mohini1 agreed, but added: “All
<>of you should close your eyes. I shall serve Amr2tam
<>to all. He who opens his eyes last, must serve Amr2tam
<>to me and he will marry me”.
<NI>All of them accepted this condition. They sat in front
<>of Mohini1 with closed eyes. In a moment Mohini1 left
<>the place with the pot of Amr2tam and went to deva-
<>loka.
<NI>4) {%Ra1hu's neck is cut.%} When the Asuras opened their
<>eyes, Mohini1 was not to be seen. Finding that they
<>were betrayed, they were in great perplexity. All of
<>them pursued Mohini1 to devaloka. Devas had put
<>the Sun and Moon gods on guard duty at the gates
<>of devaloka. At the instance of the Asuras, Ra1hu in
<>disguise entered the divine assembly chamber. The
<>Sun and Moon gods detected him and Vis2n2u with his
<>weapon, Sudars4ana Cakra cut open his neck. Swearing
<>that he would wreak vengeance on the Sun and Moon
<>Ra1hu returned. In the 8th Skandha of Bha1gavata it is
<>said that even now from time to time Ra1hu swallows
<>the Sun and Moon, but they escape through the open
<>gash in his neck and this is known as solar eclipse and
<>lunar eclipse.
<NI>5) {%Defeat of the Asuras.%} Indra and all other gods took
<>Amr2tam. The enraged Asuras attacked the gods, who
<>had gained strength and vigour by taking Amr2tam.
<>The Asuras were driven away in all directions. All the
<>three worlds began to enjoy glory and prosperity again.
<NI>6) {%Kalaku1t2a.%} The story of how the deadly poison,
<>Ka1laku1t2a arose at the churning of the ocean of Milk,
<>is given in M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 18, Verses 42-45,
<>as follows: After many precious things had come up
<>Ka1laku1t2a poison with fumes and flames, appeared on
<>the surface of the ocean. Its strong smell caused a
<>stupor in all the three worlds. Fearing that the world
<>will perish, Brahma1 requested S4iva to swallow that
<>poison. S4iva gulped it down, but stopped it in his
<>throat. From that day he became “Ni1lakan2t2ha”. [Page032-b+ 65]
<NI>7) {%The story of Aira1vata.%} Indra's tusker Aira1vata was
<>responsible for the churning of the ocean of Milk. But
<>in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 42
<>it is said that a white elephant with four tusks arose
<>during the churning of the ocean of Milk and that
<>Devendra caught and tamed it. This is an obvious
<>contradiction. Besides, in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya-
<>ka1n2d2a, 14th Sarga, the wounded Jat2a1yu describing his
<>family history to S4ri1 Ra1ma, gives the following account
<>about the origin of Aira1vata:
<NI>Kas4yapa, one of the Praja1patis, married the eight
<>daughters of Daks2a. One of them named Krodhavas4a1
<>had ten daughters by Kas4yapa. They were: Mr2gi1, Mrga-
<>mada1, Hari, Bhadramada1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li, S4veta1,
<>Surabhi, Surasa1 and Kadru. Of them Bhadramada1
<>gave birth to a daughter, Ira1vati. The tusker Aira1vata
<>is Ira1vati1's son.
<NI>An explanation for this discrepancy may be seen in
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, 3rd Section, Chapter 1. Now six
<>Manvantaras have passed (See ‘MANVANTARA’).
<>This is the seventh Manvantara. Each Manvantara
<>has a new Indra. According to this, different Indras
<>have their own Aira1vatas. This is the only explanation
<>for this apparent contradiction.
<NI>8) {%Amr2tam and Garud2a.%} There is another story about
<>Amr2tam which says that Garud2a once went to deva-
<>loka and brought Amr2tam from there to be given to
<>the Na1gas, but Devendra came down and took it back.
<>This story is given in Maha1bha1rata from Chapter 27
<>onwards. Vinata1, a wife of Kas4yapa gave birth to
<>Garud2a and Kadru and her sister gave birth to the
<>Na1gas. Once there was a dispute between Vinata1 and
<>Kadru. Vinata1 said that the hairs on the tail of Uccai-
<>s4ravas, Devendra's horse, were white but Kadru
<>asserted that they were black. To settle the dispute they
<>made a bet. The condition was that the loser must
<>become the servant maid of the winner. As instructed
<>by Kadru, some of the Na1gas went in advance and
<>hung down from the tail of Uccais4s4ravas, thus giving the
<>false appearance of a tail with black hairs. By this trick
<>Vinata1 lost the bet and had to become Kadru's servant
<>maid. As a result of it, the task of looking after Kadru's
<>children became Garud2a's duty. Kadru told him that
<>if he fetched Amr2tam from devaloka and gave it to the
<>Na1gas, she was prepared to release him from the bond-
<>age. So Garud2a flew up to devaloka, fought with the
<>gods and defeated them. He returned with the pot of
<>Amr2tam and gave it to the Na1gas. The Na1gas went
<>to take their bath after placing the pot on darbha grass
<>spread on the floor. Just then Devendra swooped down
<>and carried away the pot of Amr2tam to devaloka.
<>When the Na1gas returned after their purifying bath,
<>the pot was not to be seen. In their greed they began
<>to lick the darbha grass on which the pot was placed.
<>The sharp edge of the grass cut their tongues into two.
<>This is why the Na1gas (snakes) came to have forked
<>tongues.
<NI>Amr2tam which has been thus recovered after many
<>such adventures, is still preserved carefully in devaloka.

<>Brahma1, Mari1ci and Kas4yapa.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Mari1ci was one of the six sons, all r2s2is, of
<>Brahma1. These six sons, born parthogenetically of
<>Brahma1, were: Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha
<>and Kratu. Mari1ci had a son named Kas4yapa. Kas4yapa
<>married the thirteen daughters of Daks2a. The eldest of

<>(See Chapter 65 of A1di Parva of the Maha1bha1rata).
<NI>3) {%Events.%} The Maha1bha1rata says (S4loka 66, Chapter
<>123) that Am3s4a was present at the time of Arjuna's birth
<>when several devas had come there to see the infant.
<>In S4loka 34, Chapter 45 of S4alya Parva it is said that
<>Am3s4a was present on the occasion of the Abhis2eka of
<>Skandadeva. Am3s4a is said to have presented to Skanda-
<>deva five good warriors: Parigha, Vat2a, Bhi1ma,
<>Dahana and Dahati.
<HI>AM3S4APA1YA. Name of a priest (R2tvik) qualified to

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Sagara, a king of the Su1rya vam3s4a, (mention-
<>ed above) had two wives, Sumati (Vaidarbhi1) and
<>Kes4ini1 (Saiba1) by name. Kes4ini1 gave birth to a son
<>named Asaman5jas. Am3s4uma1n was the son of Asaman5jas

<>Chapter 6 of Karn2a Parva).
<HI>AM3S4UMATI1. The daughter of the Gandharva King
<>named Dramila. Her story is narrated in the S4iva
<>Pura1n2a to illustrate the benefits of performing the Pra-
<>dos2a-Vrata. Su1ta expatiates on the importance and
<>advantages of Prados2a-Vrata to a number of sages
<>in Naim3is4a1ran2ya. King Satyaratha was a scrupulous
<>observer of Prados2a-Vrata. Unfortunately he defaulted
<>in his observance of the Vrata owing to unavoidable
<>circumstances and, after his death, was born again as
<>the King of Vidarbha. He was killed in a battle by the
<>King of Sa1lva and his wife, pregnant at that time, fled
<>to a forest. She gave birth to a son on the bank of a
<>river. Then, when she stepped into the river to drink
<>some water, she was carried away by a crocodile. Pre-
<>sently a Brahmin woman named Us2a1 happened to pass
<>that way with her son named S4ucivrata. Seeing a new-
<>born infant there, that Brahmin woman took him, gave
<>him the name, Dharmagupta and brought him up as
<>her own son. According to the advice of a pious Brah-
<>min named S4a1n2d2ilya, both S4ucivrata and Dharmagupta [Page034-a+ 66]
<>started performing Prados2a-Vrata. Lord S4iva was pleas-
<>ed with them and gave them much wealth. Dharma-
<>gupta happened to meet Am3s4umati1, daughter of the
<>Gandharva King, Dramila, one day in a forest and
<>they fell in love with each other. Dramila came to
<>know of their love and so gave his daughter in marriage
<>to Dharmagupta. As a result of the wealth and power
<>which he had acquired by observing strictly Prados2a-
<>Vrata Dharmagupta was able to return to Vidarbha,
<>defeat King Sa1lva and regain his kingdom from him.
<HI>AMU1RTARAYAS. He was a renowned King of ancient

<>daughters are Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1,
<>Krodhavas4a1, Manu and Anala1. These daughters were [Page034-b+ 66]
<>married to Kas4yapa, son of Mari1ci. Trees, creepers etc.
<>owe their origin to Anala1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>ANALA1 II. Another Anala1 is referred to in Verse 71,
<>Chapter 66 of A1di Parva, in M.B. This Anala1 was the
<>wife of Kas4yapa and a great granddaughter of Krodha-
<>vas4a1, the daughter of Daks2a. Krodhavas4a1 begot S4veta1,
<>and she Surabhi1; Rohin2i1 was the daughter of Surabhi1
<>and Anala1 was Rohin2i1's daughter.
<HI>ANALA1 III. Daughter of Ma1lyava1n born of Sundari1.
<>She was married to Vis4va1vasu. Kumbhi1nasi1 was her
<>daughter. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Uttaraka1n2d2a).
<HI>ANA1LAMBA. A sacred pool. A bath in the pool is as
<>efficacious as the Purus2amedha yajn5a. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 32).
<HI>ANAMITRA I. A king of the Solar dynasty. The
<>A1tmapura1n2a refers to him as the son of Nighna.
<HI>ANAMITRA II. Anamitra, son of Dhr2s2t2a is referred to
<>as a king of the Ya1davas in A1tmapura1n2a.
<HI>ANAMITRA III. One Anamitra, son of Vr2s2n2i is refer-

<HI>ANANTA I. (A1DIS4ES2A).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Maha1vis2n2u begot Brahma1 and he the
<>Praja1patis and Ananta (A1dis4es2a) is one of the Praja1-
<>patis. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 14,
<>Verse 7). Ananta is also referred to as the son of
<>Kas4yapa, one of the Praja1patis born of Kadru1. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 105, Verse 41). Also Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma, elder brother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was a partial incarna-
<>tion of Ananta.
<NI>2) {%Differences with mother.%} Vinata1 and Kadru1 were
<>two wives of Kas4yapa praja1pati. Garud2a was born as
<>Vinata1's son and numerous serpents like Ananta, Va1suki,
<>Taks2aka, Ka1rkkot2aka were sons of Kadru1. Once a
<>controversy developed between Vinata1 and Kadru1, the
<>latter saying that there were a few black hairs on the
<>tail of Aira1vata and the former denying it. It was
<>agreed that she who proved wrong in the argument
<>would become the slave of the other. To prove herself
<>to be right Kadru1, the same night, asked her sons to
<>go and stay suspended in the hairs of Aira1vata's tail.
<>Some of the sons agreed to do so, while her other
<>(prominent) sons like Ananta expressed their disincli
<>nation to do such an unethical act. Kadru1 cursed these
<>disobedient children of hers to die at the serpent yajn5a
<>of Janamejaya, whereupon Ananta and his supporters
<>departed in sorrow. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>3) {%Ananta's new engagement.%} Departing thus from his
<>mother Ananta visited sacred centres like Gandha-
<>ma1dana, Badari1 and practised austerities. And, Brahma
<>appeared before Ananta and asked him not to worry,
<>but to go to the nether world and support the world
<>on his hoods. Brahma1 also told him that Garud2a would
<>render him all help in the new task. Blessed thus by [Page035-a+ 64]
<>Brahma1, Ananta gladly took up the new job. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 24).
<NI>4) Ananta has another abode in the palace of Varun2a
<>in the west. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 110, Verse
<>18).
<NI>5) {%Ananta's prowess.%} About Ananta's prowess Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a has the following to say: At the bottom of
<>Pa1ta1la there is a base (Ta1masic) form of Vis2n2u called
<>A1dis4es2a. Even the Da1navas and the Daityas are not
<>able to describe the attributes of that form. The
<>Siddhas call this A1dis4es2a Ananta who is worshipped
<>by Devas and r2s2is. Ananta has 1000 heads and the
<>Svastika mark which is clearly visible is his ornament.
<>The 1000 gems in his head illuminate all regions, and
<>he renders the Asuras powerless for the good of all the
<>worlds. A1dis4es2a whose eyes ever rotate due to the
<>overflow of his prowess, and who wears blue apparel
<>and garlands of white gems shines forth like another
<>Mount Kaila1sa beautified with garlands of clouds and
<>by the flow of the Gan3ga1. S4ri1 Devi1 and Va1run2i1 Devi1 serve
<>Ananta who holds in one hand a la1m3gala and in the
<>other a mace (mu1sala). As the deluge (end of a yuga
<>Kalpa1nta) approaches Rudra emanates from the faces
<>of Ananta and consumes the three worlds. A1dis4es2a
<>dwells in the nether world wearing the whole earth as
<>a crown. Even the Devas cannot gauge his nature, shape,
<>prowess etc. When he yawns the earth and waters shake
<>and shiver. The Gandharvas, Na1gas, Ca1ran2as etc. fail
<>to understand the real extent of his attributes, and that
<>is why this strange being is called Ananta (endless). It
<>was by worshipping Ananta and by his grace that sage
<>Garga was able to master the sciences of astronomy
<>and causation (nimitta). (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 2,
<>Chapter 5).
<NI>6) {%The land of Ananta.%} Pa1ta1la is Ananta's world, and
<>at its bottom there is a spot called Ananta. That spot
<>is 30000 yojanas in extent, and here lives Ananta. He is
<>known as San3kars2an2a also. He bears the whole nether
<>world as though it were a mustard seed. And, when
<>he thinks of destroying the entire world the Rudra
<>called San3kars2an2a will appear with other Rudras and
<>weapons like tridents (Tris4u1la). Other serpents bow at
<>the feet of Ananta, who is supremely beautiful with
<>divine lustre. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>ANANTA II. A synonym of the Sun God. (M.B., Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 24).

<HI>ANANTA1. Wife of Janamejaya, son of King Pu1ru.
<HI>ANANTA. The abode of Ananta in the nether regions.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Canto 8). (There are certain indica-
<>tions that Ananta refers to Trivandrum, Capital city of
<>the Kerala State. Explanations of words like Svarga,
<>Bhu1mi, Pa1ta1la, Ananta, Deva, Asura, throw much light
<>on this inference).
<HI>ANANTAVIJAYAM. The conch of Dharmaputra. It
<>was blown during the great war. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 15). [Page035-b+ 65]
<HI>ANAPA1YACOLA. A King of the Cola country, 1063-
<>1112. The Tamil poet Sekhilar who composed the
<>twelfth song of the great S4aiva religious book called
<>Tirumurayil was a minister of this King.
<HI>ANARAKATI1RTHA. A sacred pool. Brahma1, along
<>with Vis2n2u and others bathe daily in this sacred pool.
<>Therefore, it is said that the sins of all those who bathe
<>in the pool will be washed off.
<HI>ANARAN2YA (ANA1RAN2YA). A King of the Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 236).
<>For genealogy, see IKS2VA1KU. Anaran2ya was a vege-
<>tarian. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 115, Verse 59).
<>Ra1van2a once attacked his country whom he challenged
<>to a duel. In the duel Anaran2ya died. Before dying he
<>cursed Ra1van2a that he would be killed by Ra1ma, son

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Maha1vis2n2u were born in order
<>Brahma1, Sva1yambhuva Manu, Devahu1ti, Anasu1ya1. To
<>Sva1yambhuva, son of Brahma1, was born by his wife
<>S4ataru1pa1 five children: Utta1napa1da, Priyavrata, A1huti.
<>Devahu1ti and Prasu1ti and Devahu1ti was married to
<>Kardama, son of Brahma1. They begot two daughters,
<>Kala1 and Anasu1ya1. Mari1ci married Kala1 and Atri
<>married Anasu1ya1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 1, Chapter 4).
<NI>2) {%The Tapas4s4akti of Anasu1ya1.%} Once upon a time, rains
<>having failed for ten years the whole world sweated in
<>agony and river Gan3ga1 got dried up. Famine stalked the
<>world. In this dire contingency it was the tapas4s4akti of
<>Anasu1ya1 that made trees bear fruits and Gan3ga1 to flow
<>again. Also, she converted ten days into nights on the
<>request of the Devas.
<NI>During their forest life Ra1ma and Si1ta1 reached the her-
<>mitage of sage Atri, and the sage and Anasu1ya1 treated
<>the guests sumptuously. The above story about the
<>tapas4s4akti of Anasu1ya1 was told then by Atri. The story
<>helped to increase Ra1ma's respect for Anasu1ya1. Anasu1ya1
<>gave Si1ta1 all proper advice. She taught Si1ta1 that abso-
<>lute service to husband is the greatest tapas ordained
<>to women. Anasu1ya1 gave to Si1ta1 a very sacred garland
<>and a sublime gem. And, after that Ra1ma and Si1ta1 left
<>the hermitage. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayodhya1ka1n2d2a,
<>Cantos 117 and 118.).
<NI>3) {%Sons of Anasu1ya1.%} She had three sons: Datta1treya,
<>Durva1sas and Candra. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter
<>10). (The reason for Maha1vis2n2u being born as Datta1t-
<>reya, S4iva as Durva1sas and Brahma1 as Candra to
<>Anasu1ya1 is given under Atri).
<HI>ANAUPAMYA1. Wife of Ba1n2a1sura. Once she developed
<>an amorous interest in Na1rada, which led to some
<>domestic quarrels. (Padma Pura1n2a, A1dika1n2d2a, Chapter
<>14).
<HI>ANAVADYA1. Wife of Kas4yapa, this Apsara1 woman
<>participated in the birthday celebrations of Arjuna.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 62).
<HI>AN2D2A.
<F>*) AN2D2A. The primal seed (An2d2a=egg or seed) from which everything was born.</F> Su1ta, the disciple of Vya1sa said to the Munis
<>at the Naimis4a1ran2ya about the creation of the Universe:
<>In the beginning in the heavy universal darkness, the [Page036-a+ 65]
<>first seed of life (an2d2a) appeared. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verse 28).
<HI>AN2D2AKAT2A1HA. The entire universe consisting of the

<>Atala.
<HI>ANDHA I. An offspring of Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Kadru1. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Verse 16).
<HI>ANDHA II. There is a story in M.B., about a hunts-
<>man, Vat2aka killing one Andha, an evil being. Andha
<>whose form and shape were that of an animal, by do-
<>ing tapas, became recipient of a boon for destroying
<>everything. Brahma1 rendered him blind lest the world
<>perish, and that animal began to be known as Andha.
<>When Andha began his programme of complete destruc-
<>tion many people rushed up to Vis4va1mitra in his abode
<>in the forest. Andha followed them. But, Vis4va1mitra,
<>in the interests of self-protection pointed out the refu-
<>gees to Andha. As punishment for this sin Vis4va1mitra
<>had once to go to hell. This story was related by
<>Kr2s2n2a to Arjuna during the great war at Kuruks2etra,
<>and the reason for telling the story was this: During
<>the fight Arjuna hesitated to aim arrows against Karn2a.
<>Enraged by this attitude of Arjuna Dharmaputra asked
<>him to hand over his famous bow, Ga1n2d2i1va to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>Feeling insulted at this demand Arjuna, all on a sud-
<>den, drew his sword to do away with Dharmaputra.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, prevented Arjuna from attacking his noble
<>brother, and in this context related the above story to
<>prove the truth that sins committed even unwittingly
<>will lead one, as in the case of Vis4va1mitra to hell.
<>(M.B., Karn2a Parva, Chapter 69).
<HI>ANDHA III. Upamanyu, the excellent disciple of
<>Dhaumya, consumed the leaves of a tree which made
<>him blind. (See Ayodhadhaumya) (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 3).
<HI>ANDHAKA I. There was a very renowned king called
<>Andhaka in the Yadu dynasty. All kings belonging to
<>this dynasty used to be called Andhakas.
<HI>ANDHAKA II. Verse 12, Chapter 4 of M.B., Udyoga
<>Parva refers to another King called Andhaka. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas had sent to him a messenger soliciting mili-
<>tary help.
<HI>ANDHAKA III. An Asura.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} This Asura was the foster son of Hiran2ya1ks2a.
<>S4iva was really his father. While once S4iva was
<>immersed in yoga his daughter closed his eyes play-
<>fully with her hands, and lo! a darkness rose and
<>enveloped the whole place. From that darkness, with
<>a sound as that of thunderbolt, appeared a Ra1ks2asa.
<>He got the name Andhaka as he was born from dark-
<>ness. At that time Hiran2ya1ks2a was doing tapas for a
<>son. S4iva appeared before him and bestowing on him
<>Andhaka as a foster son said as follows: “If he
<>(Andhaka) earns the hatred of the world or desires
<>even the mother of the three worlds or kills brahmins
<>I will myself burn him to ashes”. After saying this
<>S4iva disappeared. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 63).
<NI>2) {%Andhaka desires Pa1rvati1 with lust.%} One day overcome
<>by erotic passion Andhaka said to his henchmen as
<>follows: “He is my true friend who brings S4iva's
<>consort, Pa1rvati1 to me. Yes, he is my brother, nay,
<>father even.” Hearing these ravings of Andhaka,
<>Prahla1da went to him and convinced him that Pa1rvati1, [Page036-b+ 65]
<>in fact was his mother. But Andhaka was not quieten-
<>ed. Then Prahla1da explained to him the gravity of
<>the sin of desiring other people's wives. Even this had
<>no effect on Andhaka. He sent S4ambara1sura to S4iva
<>to ask for and bring Pa1rvati1 to him. S4iva sent word to
<>Andhaka that if the latter would defeat him in the
<>game of dice Pa1rvati1 would be sent to him. Andhaka
<>got enraged and rushed to mount Mandara and began
<>a fight with S4iva.
<NI>3) {%Death.%} Defeated in the encounter, Andhaka craved
<>for S4iva's pardon. He admitted that Pa1rvati1 was his
<>mother. He also prayed for S4iva's blessings for removal
<>of his Asurahood. S4iva granted him the prayers. The
<>sins and Asurahood of Andhaka were thus ended. S4iva
<>made him the head of the Asuras, named Bhr2n3gi.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 63 etc.).
<HI>ANDHAKA(M). A sacred pool. A dip in this pool will

<HI>ANDHAKU1PA(M). In the Devi1 Bha1gavata Maha1vis2n2u
<>describes 28 hells to Na1rada, and Andhaku1pam is one
<>of them. (see Naraka). Andhaku1pa is reserved for those
<>who kill either Brahmins or devotees of God or Sannya1-
<>sins (holy people). This hell abounds in cruel beasts
<>like the bear and leopard, evil birds like the eagle,
<>reptiles like the snake and scorpion and dirty insects
<>like bugs and mosquitos. The sinner will have to put
<>up with all these sufferings in hell till the period of his
<>punishment expires. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama
<>Skandha).
<HI>ANDHATA1MISRA. One of the 28 hells. (See Naraka).
<>This hell is destined for wives who cheat their husbands
<>and consume food and for husbands who cheat their
<>wives and eat food. Agents of Yama get hold of
<>such sinners and push them into the Andhata1misra. As
<>the cords of the agents with which they bind the sin-
<>ners get tighter around their bodies they faint and fall
<>down owing to unbearable pain. When they regain
<>consciousness and try to run away and escape, the
<>Agents of Yama again bind them with the cord. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>ANDHRA (A1NDHRA). This is the Andhra Pradesh in
<>modern India. It has to be surmised that this place was
<>very famous during the period of the composition of the

<>49).
<HI>ANDHRA. Warriors from Andhra were called Andhras.
<>(M.B., Dron2a Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 8).
<HI>ANDHRAKA I. Verse 24, Chapter 4 of Sabha1 Parva,
<>describes this king of Andhra Des4a as having sat in the

<>the Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a performed by Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 11).
<HI>ANDHRAKA II. The warriors of Andhra Des4a were
<>called Andhrakas also. (M.B., Karn2a Parva, Chapter
<>20, Verses 10 and 11). In the Bha1rata war the King of
<>Pa1n2d2ya defeated those warriors. Kr2s2n2a incited Arjuna
<>to kill the Andhras and the Pulindas. (M.B., Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 73, Verses 19 to 21).
<HI>ANDHRAKA III. Andhrakas are classed with Mlec- [Page037-a+ 65]
<>chas (lowest caste of people) in Verse 42, Chapter 207
<>of S4a1nti Parva.
<HI>ANENAS I. A king of the Lunar dynasty (Candra

<>Nahus2a, Ks2atravr2ddha, Ra1ji, Rambha and Anenas.
<>Nahus2a had a son named Yaya1ti to whom were born

<NI>Once there lived a hermit named Utatthya. He was
<>the elder brother of Br2haspati. One day when Mamata1,
<>Utatthya's wife, was pregnant, Br2haspati approached
<>her with carnal desires. In spite of her efforts to dis-
<>suade her brother-in-law from his attempts she could not
<>prevail upon him. He forced her and satisfied his desire.
<>The child in her womb protested and kicked the sperm
<>of Br2haspati out into the floor. Br2haspati got angry and
<>cursed the child in the womb: “May you fall in perpe-
<>tual darkness”. So the child was born blind and
<>remained blind throughout his life. Hence he got the
<>name ‘Di1rghatamas’. Di1rghatamas married Pradves2i. A
<>son named Gautama was born to them. The duty of
<>supporting Di1rghatamas fell upon the wife and the son,
<>who put him on a raft and pushed him astray into the
<>River Ganges. King Bali, who was bathing in the river
<>saw this. He rescued the hermit and took him to the
<>palace and pleasing him by hospitality, requested him
<>to beget children in his wife Sutes2n2a1, who detesting the
<>idea sent a S4u1dra1 woman Dha1treyi1 in her stead and
<>eleven children were born to them. By and by Di1rgha-
<>tamas came to know of the deceit played by Sutes2n2a1 on
<>him and he became very angry. But the King pacified
<>him and pleased him again and Di1rghatamas begot five
<>sons by Sutes2n2a1. They were An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Paun2d2ra and Suhma. Di1rghatamas blessed them that they
<>would become very famous. An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Paun2d2ra and Suhma were the five kingdoms ruled by
<>An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga, Paun2d2ra and Suhma respectively.
<>These five are the famous Kings of the Ba1li family.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 104).
<NI>3) {%How An3ga got children.%} Once An3ga performed a
<>horse sacrifice. But the gods did not appear to receive [Page037-b+ 64]
<>oblations. Holy seers said that the Gods refused to
<>accept the oblations offered by the King because he was
<>childless. So he performed the sacrifice called Putraka1-
<>mes2t2i (Sacrifice to get a son) and from the sacrificial
<>fire arose a divine person with a golden flask of pud-
<>ding, which he offered to the King and his queen. The
<>King and the queen Suni1tha1 ate the pudding, as a
<>result of which a son was born to them. He was named
<>Vena. This son was wicked. Because of his wickedness
<>the King became so miserable that he left his kingdom
<>and went on a pilgrimage. Since there was no other
<>means the people enthroned Vena, who tortured his

<NI>f) After the battle, S4ri1 Ra1ma anointed An3gada as the
<>heir-apparent to the Kingdom of Kis2kindha1. The neck-
<>lace which Ba1li had given on his death to Sugri1va, was
<>returned to An3gada. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>g) S4ri1 Ra1ma returned to Ayodhya1 after his forest
<>life and celebrated a horse sacrifice. The sacrificial
<>horse was caught and detained by King Suratha. Com-
<>ing to know of this S4atrughna sent An3gada to deal
<>with Suratha, who said that the horse was detained
<>with the intention of meeting with S4ri1 Ra1ma personally.
<>An3gada returned and told S4atrughna what Suratha had
<>said to him. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a).
<HI>AN3GADA II. There was a prince called An3gada among

<HI>AN3GAKARMA. Actions on the stage are of two kinds.
<>One is to express by the major organs of the body. The
<>other is to express by the minor organs of the body. Head
<>etc. are major organs and eyebrow etc. are minor

<>An3gakarma and those by minor organs are called Prat-
<>yan3ga Karma. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 341).
<HI>AN3GA1LAMMA. She is the wife of Vi1rabhadra, a servant [Page038-a+ 65]
<>of S4iva. She has a rope in her left hand, with which she
<>hauls up the spirits of the dead.
<HI>AN3GA(M). The kingdom ruled by King An3ga. Other
<>details:
<NI>1) {%The Dynasty.%} The first King of the An3ga dynasty
<>was An3ga the son of Bali. Anaga1bhu, Draviratha,
<>Dharmaratha, Romapa1da (Lomapa1da), Caturan3ga,
<>Pr2thula1ks2a, Br2hadratha, Br2hanmanas, Jayadratha,
<>Vijaya, Dr2d2havrata, Satyakarma1, Atiratha, Karn2a,
<>Vr2s2asena and others were kings of this dynasty. Karn2a
<>was the adopted son of Atiratha. During the period of
<>the Maha1bha1rata, Kings of the Atiratha family were
<>under the sway of the Candra vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty)
<>kings such as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u. (For further in-
<>formations see the word Atiratha).
<NI>2) {%How Karn2a became the king of An3ga.%} A contest in
<>archery and the wielding of other weapons was going
<>on in Hastina1pura, the competitors being the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. The status of Karn2a, who appeared
<>on the side of the Kauravas, was questioned by the
<>Pa1n2d2avas on the occasion and Duryodhana, who always
<>stood on his dignity, anointed Karn2a as the King of
<>An3ga, on the spot. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 136).
<NI>3) {%Drought in the kingdom of An3ga.%} Lomapa1da (Roma-
<>pa1da) the king of An3ga once deceived a hermit Brahmin.
<>So all the Brahmins quitted the country and thereafter
<>there was no rainfall in the country for several years.
<>The sages of the country began to think on the means
<>of bringing about rain. One day they approached the
<>King and told him that the only way to get rain was
<>to bring the great hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga to the country.
<NI>Once Kas4yapa happened to see Urvas4i1 and he had
<>seminal flow. The sperm fell in a river. A deer swal-
<>lowed it along with the water it drank. It gave birth to a
<>human child with horns on the head. This child was
<>called R2s2yas4r2n3ga. It was brought up by a hermit
<>called Vibha1n2d2aka in his hut. R2s2yas4r2n3ga had never
<>seen women and by virtue of this, there occurred rain-
<>fall wherever he went. The King Lomapa1da sent some
<>courtesans to the forest to attract R2s2yas4r2n3ga, who
<>following them arrived at the court of Lomapa1da the
<>King of An3ga and the King gave R2s2yas4r2n3ga, as a gift,
<>his daughter S4a1nta1. Thus the country got rain. This
<>Lomapa1da was a friend of Das4aratha. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapters 110 to 113).
<NI>4) {%How the Kingdom got the name An3ga.%} One opinion is
<>that the Kingdom got its name from the King An3ga
<>who ruled over it. Another opinion is that the king got
<>his name from the country he ruled. However there is
<>a story revealing how the country came to be called
<>An3ga.
<NI>In the realm of God, preliminary steps were being taken
<>for making S4ri1 Parames4vara wed Pa1rvati1. According to
<>the instructions of Devendra, Ka1madeva (the Lord of
<>Love--Cupid) was trying to break the meditation of S4iva
<>and when S4iva opened his third eye, fire emitted from
<>it and Anan3ga (Ka1madeva) was burned to ashes. It
<>was in the country of An3ga that the ashes of the ‘an3ga’
<>(Body) of Ka1madeva fell and from that day onwards
<>the country came to be called An3ga and Ka1madeva,
<>‘Anan3ga’ (without body). (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la-
<>ka1n2d2a, Sarga 26).
<NI>5) {%Other informations.%}

<>Vis4va1mitra told the boys in answer to their questions
<>thus: “In olden days this place was a countryside
<>known as An3gamalaja or Malada or Karu1s2a. There is
<>a reason for calling the country by that name. Indra
<>killed Vr2tra and thereby incurred the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1 and so he came away to this country and lived
<>here for a while. The Gods found him out here. They
<>poured water on the head of the unclean Indra and the
<>dirt, hunger, excreta and Karu1s2a having been separated
<>from his body fell on the soil of this place and was
<>mingled with it. Indra's body became pure. As excreta,
<>Karu1s2a etc. were mingled with the soil of this country,
<>it came to be called An3gamalaja, Malada or Karu1s2a
<>from that day onwards. One part of the country was
<>called Malada and the other part Karu1s2a. Indra, having
<>been purified by washing in water returned to heaven
<>with the gods. After that this country became uninha-

<>Parames2u. To Sabha1nara was born Ka1la1nala and Sr2n5-
<>jaya to Ka1la1nala, Puran5jaya to Sr2n5jaya and Janamejaya
<>to Puran5jaya. Maha1sa1la was the son of Janamejaya;
<>Maha1manas the son of Maha1sa1la, and Us4inara the son

<>Kr2mi, Suvrata and S4ibi by his wives Nr2ga1, Nara1, Kr2mi,
<>Das4a1 and Dr2s2advati1 respectively. To S4ibi were born
<>four sons called Pr2thudarbha, Vi1raka, Kaikaya and

<HI>AN3GA1RAKA I. An Asura who took the form of a pig.
<>The story of how this Asura was killed by his daughter
<>An3ga1ravati1, is given below.
<NI>Long ago there was an emperor named Mahendra-
<>varma1 in Ujjayini1. His son Maha1sena did penance for
<>a long time to get a wife and a sword. At last Devi1
<>appeared and granted the boon: “My son! take this
<>extraordinary sword. So long as you have this sword,
<>your enemies will not prevail against you. An3ga1ravati1,
<>the renowned beauty of the three worlds, who is the
<>daughter of the Asura An3ga1raka, will become your
<>wife in due course. As you do horrible deeds, you will
<>be called Can2d2amaha1sena”. He was given the sword
<>and a tusker called Nad2a1giri. One day Maha1sena went
<>to the forest for hunting. He saw a very large pig. The
<>King used his arrows. But they did little harm to the
<>pig. Moreover it turned the chariot of the King over
<>to one side and ran to a cave. The King followed it
<>with fury. On the way he sat on the bank of a lake
<>with wonder, for a lady of exquisite beauty was walk-
<>ing along the mossy turf in the midst of some maids.
<>Slowly she approached the King and talked with him.
<>The young lady had entirely captured the heart of the
<>King, who told her everything. She began to weep.
<>“Who are you? Why do you weep?” The King asked [Page039-b+ 65]
<>her. She replied with a deep sigh. “The pig you saw,
<>is my father An3ga1raka1sura. His body is as hard as
<>diamond and not vulnerable to any sort of weapon.
<>These maids have been caught by him from various
<>royal houses and brought here for my help. My name
<>is An3ga1ravati1. My father was changed to a giant by a
<>curse. Now he is asleep discarding the form of pig.
<>When he wakes up, filled with hunger and thirst, he
<>will do you harm. My tears flowed out in the form of
<>heated life-breaths, when I thought of these things.”
<NI>The King said, “Go and sit by him and cry when he
<>wakes up. He will ask the reason. Then tell him that
<>you had been crying, when you thought how forlorn
<>you would be without a mate, in case your father was
<>killed by somebody”. An3ga1ravati1 did as she was told.
<>Hearing her words An3ga1raka said, “My daughter! No
<>body can kill me. My body is made of diamond. There
<>is only one vulnerable point in my body which is on
<>my left forearm and it is always covered with my
<>bow.”
<NI>The king hid himself closely and heard everything. He
<>fought with the Asura and hitting at the vuinerable
<>point killed him. The king married An3ga1ravati1 and
<>took her to his palace. Two sons were born to him.
<>They were called Gopa1laka and Pa1laka. By the grace
<>of Indra a daughter also was born to him by her and
<>she was Va1savadatta1, the wife of the famous Udayana.

<>satellite of Brahma1 is seen to have been called by the
<>name An3ga1raka also. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 11, Stanza 29).
<HI>AN3GA1RAKA IV. We see one An3ga1raka among the one
<>hundred and eight sons of the Sun. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 10).
<HI>AN3GA1RAKA1. (SIM3HIKA1).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended in the following order from
<>Vis2n2u. Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-An3ga1raka1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} In the battle between the Gods and the
<>Asuras, most of the Asuras were killed and one Asura
<>fled from the clutches of death to Pa1ta1la (the nether
<>world). Surasa1 was the daughter of that Asura. Kas4yapa
<>married Surasa1. To them were born the two daughters,
<>An3ga1raka1 (Sim3hika1) and Aja1mukhi1, and four sons,
<>called S4u1rapadma, Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura and
<>Gomukha. Thus Sim3hika1 is the sister of Ta1raka1sura.
<>(Skand2a Pura1n2a, Asura Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>{%Other details.%} This giantess An3ga1raka1 had a clash once,
<>with Hanu1ma1n. Sugri1va had sent a large number of
<>monkeys under the leadership of Hanuma1n to search
<>for Si1ta1. He gave Hanu1ma1n certain instructions regard-
<>ing the route he had to follow. Sugri1va said, “There is
<>a giantess in the middle of that Southern Sea. Her
<>name is An3ga1ra. She pulls the shadow towards her and
<>feeds on the object of the shadow.”
<NI>From this it is clear that she was a giantess who lived
<>in the sea between Lan3ka1 and South India. She knew
<>the art of bringing to her side, anybody who passed
<>over the sea, by pulling at his shadow. When Hanu1ma1n
<>jumped to Lan3ka1 from the mountain of Mahendra the
<>giantess attacked Hanu1ma1n. It is seen that the name [Page040-a+ 65]
<>Sim3hika1 also is used for An3ga1raka1. Hanu1ma1n who was
<>subjected to the excessive attraction of Sim3hika1, felt a
<>great storm raging round him. Finally he found her out,
<>a monster with such an uncouth face and a mouth as
<>wide as the hole of Pa1ta1la (the nether world). There
<>was a terrible fight between Hanu1ma1n and the monster,
<>in which Sim3hika1, fell on the ground beaten. After the
<>fight Hanu1ma1n resumed his journey. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-

<>celebrated by Yudhis2t2hira. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,

<HI>AN3GIRAS I.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He is a hermit born from the mind of Brahma1.
<>Six mind-born sons (Ma1nasa-Putras) were born to
<>Brahma1, known as Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya,
<>Pulaha, and Kratu. All the six of them became great
<>hermits. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65,

<F>*) There is another story about the birth of An3giras. At a sacrifice celebrated by Rudra, seminal flow occurred to Brahma1 who
<>happened to see some celestial maids and was overpowered by passionate feelings. Brahma1 put the sperm in the fire. From that fire appeared
<>An3giras along with Mari1ci, Bhr2gu and others. This deva (the shining one--the God) was called An3giras because his origin was from An3ga1ra
<>or Cinder.</F>
<NI>2) {%Important events.%}
<NI>(1) {%The failure of An3giras.%} There was a King named
<>Citraketu in the kingdom of S4u1rasena. Once An3giras
<>reached his palace when the King was in a miserable
<>state as he was childless. The King informed An3giras of
<>his sorrow. He pacified the King and said that a son
<>would be born to him. He and his wife Kr2tadyuti1 were
<>filled with joy. The other wives of the King did not like
<>this. They feared that when a son was born to Kr2ta-
<>dyuti1 the King might overlook them. To the king a
<>son was born of Kr2tadyuti1 and the other wives poisoned
<>the child and killed him. While the parents were weep-
<>ing over the dead child An3giras and Na1rada arrived
<>there and wiped their tears. An3giras agreed to bring the
<>child back to life. He instantly called the spirit of the
<>dead child to him and asked it to become the son of
<>Citraketu. The spirit replied that it had a large number
<>of parents in several previous births and that it was not
<>possible for it to become the son of Citraketu, and then
<>it vanished. An3giras and Na1rada went on their way.
<>Citraketu became a devotee of Vis2n2u and by the
<>curse of Pa1rvati1, was born again as Vr2tra1sura. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 6, Chapter 14).
<NI>(2) {%How An3giras cursed Sudars4ana and transmuted him to a
<>serpent.%} While Sudars4ana, a vidya1dhara (a class of semi-
<>gods) was travelling lustfully with a group of beautiful
<>girls he came across An3giras and some other hermits. He
<>teased An3giras calling him ‘durbha1ga’ (unlucky) and
<>An3giras cursed him and changed him to a big serpent
<>and he was promised liberation from the curse, when,
<>during the dva1para yuga (one of the four ages) Maha1-
<>vis2n2u would incarnate as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and would tread
<>upon him and then he would regain his former form.
<>From that day onwards Sudars4ana lived on the banks
<>of the river Ka1lindi1 in the form of a serpent. It was [Page040-b+ 61]
<>the time when S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was having his game of love
<>with the Gopa women. On one night one serpent bit
<>Nanda the foster father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. The cowherds
<>or gopas hit at the snake with burned wood. But it was
<>of no use. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came there and thrashed the
<>serpent, which instantly took the form of Sudars4ana
<>Vidya1dhara and praising S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a entered heaven.

<>stripped Pa1n5ca1li1 of her clothes in the Palace hall, in

<>in the game of dice. Before this Pa1n5ca1li1 had asked
<>Duryodhana one question, “Have you won yourself or
<>myself?” One husband was not authorised to stake his
<>wife Pa1n5ca1li1 who was the wife of five husbands. Moreover
<>according to the S4a1stras (sciences) the deeds executed
<>by a King, who was miserable due to hunting, drinking,
<>playing dice and hankering after a woman, were not
<>legally binding. Hence how could the Kauravas own
<>Pa1n5ca1li1?” Vidura said that the witnesses in the hall had
<>to give an impartial answer to this question, and that
<>the punishment of falsehood would come upon the doer
<>himself. As an instance he gave the following old story:
<>Virocana was the son of Prahla1da; Sudhanva1 the son
<>of An3giras and Virocana fell in love with the same
<>woman once. There arose a contention between these
<>two as to who was greater. They staked their lives on
<>the issue. Then both of them together approached Prah-
<>la1da and requested him to give a decision as to which
<>of them was the elder. Thinking that Prahla1da might side
<>with Virocana his son, Sudhanva1 said to him, “Sir, [Page041-a+ 65]
<>you should not utter words of falsehood, nor should you
<>abstain from speaking the truth. If you do so your head
<>will be cut into a hundred pieces by Indra with his
<>Vajra1yudha (the weapon of thunderbolt)”. Hesitating
<>to take a decision, because of the words of Sudhanva1,
<>Prahla1da went to Kas4yapa to clear his doubts, and
<>asked: “Lord, do you know which are the future worlds
<>destined for those who utter words of falsehood or abstain
<>from giving out the truth?” Kas4yapa said, “On him, who
<>abstains from speaking truth knowingly a thousand cords
<>of death will fall. He who tells falsehood will have
<>to perform many a deed of duty to attain heaven.”
<NI>Having heard the words of Kas4yapa, Prahla1da said to
<>Virocana, “Virocana, Sudhanva1 is greater than you.
<>An3giras is greater than me. Likewise the mother of
<>Sudhanva1 is nobler than your mother. So according to
<>your bet you owe your life to Sudhanva1.” Pleased at
<>the righteousness of Prahla1da, Sudhanva1 gave Virocana
<>a boon to live a hundred years more. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 63).
<NI>(6) {%How An3giras became the first son of Agni (Fire God).%}
<>Once An3giras was blazing out as a furious being. All
<>the worlds were illuminated by that flame-fire. As
<>An3giras was performing the functions of Agni (fire),
<>peoples of the worlds discarded Agni, who being sad at
<>the derision shown towards him by the worlds went to
<>a forest and hid himself there. The living beings
<>were in trouble owing to lack of fire. When he became
<>aware of this An3giras went to the forest and pacified
<>Agni. From that day onwards An3giras agreed to be-
<>come the first son of Agni, who resumed his duties as
<>usual. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 217).
<NI>(7) {%How An3giras got the name Atharva1n3giras.%} After the
<>slaughter of Vr2tra1sura, Indra went to the lake known
<>as Amr2tasaras and hid himself there in a lotus flower. At
<>this time the Gods anointed Nahus2a as Indra. Agastya
<>cursed him and turned him to a serpent and sent
<>him to the earth. When Indra returned to heaven many
<>persons gathered there to greet him. An3giras also was
<>one among them who did obeisance to Indra. He paid
<>his homage by reciting the hymns of Atharvaveda. Indra
<>who was greatly pleased at this, said to An3giras, “Here-
<>after you shall be known as Atharva1n3giras”. An3giras
<>who got this boon from Indra, returned with gratitude.

<>many other hermits came to Dron2a and told him,
<>“You have burned to death innumerable men with your
<>Brahma1stra (The most powerful of all missiles). Your
<>end is very near. So put your weapons down and stop
<>your fight.” Dron2a seems to have paid no heed at all
<>to the advice of the hermits. He did not stop fighting
<>too.
<NI>(9) {%The sermon of An3giras on the merits of Ti1rthas or holy
<>places (Baths).%} Dharmaputra once asked Bhi1s2ma about
<>the importance of holy gha1t2s or ti1rthas (Baths). Bhi1s2ma
<>told Dharmaputra, what An3giras had once told Gautama

<HI>AN2IMA1N2D2AVYA.
<NI>1) {%General. How he got the name An2ima1n2d2avya.%} Once
<>there was a famous Brahmin named Ma1n2d2avya. He did
<>Tapas (penance) for many years standing silent in
<>front of his A1s4rama, under a tree, raising his hands in
<>prayer. At that time some thieves happened to pass by
<>that place, with stolen property belonging to the King.
<>Finding that the King's men were pursuing them, the
<>thieves fled away after leaving their stolen property in
<>Ma1n2d2avya's A1s4rama. The King's men seized Ma1n2d2avya
<>with the king's property. Even prolonged and repeated
<>questionings did not bring out a single word from
<>Ma1n2d2avya. At last the thieves were caught. Mistaking
<>him as one of the thieves, the King's men produced
<>Ma1n2d2avya also along with the thieves before the King.
<>The thieves were all condemned to death. The royal
<>executioners took all of them to the place of execution
<>and stuck them up at the tip of a trident (S4u1la). The
<>thieves died, but even after a long time Ma1n2d2avya did [Page042-b+ 64]
<>not die. In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Verses 46-
<>51, it is said that at this stage S4iva appeared and blessed
<>him with longevity and then vanished. Several Munis in
<>the shape of birds came near Ma1n2d2avya who was lying
<>on the trident and made enquiries about him. The King
<>came to know of all these stories. Full of repentance, he
<>went and begged pardon of Ma1n2d2avya. The attempt
<>to pull out the trident from Ma1n2d2avya's body failed. At
<>last it was removed by cutting it off. Since the tip (An2i)
<>of the trident was left behind in his body he was there-
<>after known as “An2i Ma1n2d2avya”. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 107).
<NI>2) {%Curse on Dharma.%} After going about in the world
<>for many years with the tip of the trident in his body,
<>An2i Ma1n2d2avya once asked Dharma: “Oh! Lord, why
<>is it that an innocent man like me is afflicted with the
<>trident?”. Dharma answered: “In your boyhood
<>you once caught small birds and pierced them with
<>a grass reed. It is a result of that sin that you have been
<>pierced with the trident.” Ma1n2d2avya replied: “The
<>S4a1stras ordain that there shall be no punishment for
<>sins committed till the age of twelve. Therefore the
<>punishment inflicted on me is wrong. As the murder
<>of a Brahmin is a greater sin than any other murder,
<>may you be born as a man in the ‘S4u1dra Caste’.”
<NI>By the above curse of Ma1n2d2avya, Dharma was born a
<>son of a S4u1dra woman. It was this child who later on
<>became the renowned Vidura of the Maha1bha1rata.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 107).
<NI>3) {%The story of how the Sun did not rise.%} When An2i
<>Ma1n2d2avya lay on the tip of the trident another event
<>happened. Atri Muni's son Ugras4ravas was the husband
<>of S4i1lavati1. No other woman had so far surpassed
<>S4i1lavati1 in her fidelity to her husband. Once Ugras4ravas
<>happened to fall ill. He expressed his desire to visit a
<>prostitute's house. As he was too weak he could not walk.
<>The devoted wife S4i1lavati1 carried him on her own
<>shoulders and took him to the prostitute's house. They
<>were passing near the piace where An2i Ma1n2d2avya was
<>lying on the trident. Coming to know of the matter,
<>Ma1n2d2avya pronounced a curse that Ugras4ravas should
<>die before sunrise. S4i1lavati1 shuddered on hearing this.
<>Fearing that she would be widowed by the death of
<>Ugras4ravas, she, in her turn, pronounced a curse that
<>the Sun should not rise again.
<NI>Next day the sun did not rise. All activities came to a
<>standstill. At last the gods approached Atri Muni. They
<>induced Anasu1ya1, Atri's wife to persuade S4i1lavati1 to
<>withdraw her curse. Then the sun rose again and
<>Ugras4ravas died. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 42).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%} When the Pa1n2d2avas were living in
<>Hastina1pura, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once paid a visit to them. On
<>his way he met with certain munis. Among them was
<>An2i Ma1n2d2avya also. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 83).
<NI>5) Once the King of Videha told Ma1n2d2avya that the
<>world is transient and advised him to strive for spiritual
<>peace. An2i Ma1n2d2avya who was pleased with the
<>King's advice attained moks2a (salvation) at once. (M.B.,

<>handsome prince refers to his being kidnapped by Us2a1
<>daughter of Ba1n2a1sura. Ba1n2a1sura, chief among the 100
<>sons of emperor Maha1bali had 1000 hands. S4iva pleased
<>by the sacrificial devotion of Ba1n2a1sura granted, as
<>requested by him, the boon that he himself (S4iva) and
<>Pa1rvati1 would guard the fort of the Asura, of course
<>with some reluctance. Now, none had the prowess to
<>attack this valiant Asura. Overflowing with conceit at
<>this he challenged S4iva to a fight. S4iva foretold that
<>the flagstaff of Ba1n2a would one day be broken and
<>then a powerful antagonist would defeat him. Ba1n2a
<>impatiently awaited the threatened day.
<NI>One day Us2a1 happened to witness the scene of S4iva
<>and Pa1rvati1 engaged in love-making. Excited by the
<>sight Us2a1 too desired to enact such a scene with a lover,
<>and she intimated her desire to Pa1rvati1. Pa1rvati1 told
<>her that Us2a1 would, within three days, see in a dream
<>a handsome prince with whom she might make love.
<>Accordingly, dressed herself in all glory with choicest
<>ornaments Us2a1 awaited the happy day. On the third
<>day a handsome prince appeared before her in her
<>dream. Waking up, she began crying. Seeing Us2a1 crying
<>Citralekha1, her companion, and daughter of her father's
<>minister, assured her (Us2a1) that whoever might be the
<>prince who appeared in her dream shall be brought
<>down with the power of Mantra. Citralekha1 drew the
<>pictures of all princes known to her and showed them to
<>Us2a1. The pictures represented all handsome men from
<>Devas to men. ‘No, this is not my prince charming’ was
<>Us2a1's reply. Then Citralekha1 drew the picture of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>of Pradyumna, and then of Aniruddha. When Us2a1 saw
<>Aniruddha's picture she stretched her hands to embrace
<>that. It was this prince who had appeared before her
<>in the dream.
<NI>Next night Citralekha1, by the power of her Mantra,
<>brought into Us2a1's room from Dva1raka1 Aniruddha, who
<>was then in his sleep. While Us2a1 and Aniruddha were
<>thus together in the room her father, Ba1n2a, got scent
<>of it and took Aniruddha into custody.
<NI>The disappearance of Aniruddha led to much commotion
<>in Dva1raka1. Then Na1rada reached Dva1raka1 and gave
<>details about the Aniruddha incident. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and
<>Pradyumna, in all rage, hurried to Ba1n2a's palace and
<>encircled his palace with a strong army. Then did Ba1n2a's
<>flagstaff break into two and fell down. The fierce fight
<>that ensued ended in the defeat of Ba1n2a. Aniruddha
<>married Us2a1 and the elated couple started for Dva1raka1.
<>Vajra was the son of Aniruddha. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama
<>Skandha, Chapters 61, 62 and 63).

<HI>ARAKKILLAM. (Palace of wax). Both the Kaurava
<>and the Pa1n2d2ava princes lived in Hastina1pura. The

<>of their eyes to the people. This evoked great jealousy
<>in Duryodhana who made up his mind to completely
<>ruin the Pa1n2d2avas somehow or other. Duryodhana, with
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's consent, built a new palace at Va1ran2a1-
<>vata. Though many others did not know that the
<>palace was made of wax the Pa1n2d2avas, from secret
<>information knew the fact. But, they only pretended
<>ignorance. Duryodhana and his minister Purocana,
<>saw to it that the Pa1n2d2avas shifted their residence to
<>the waxen palace. Duryodhana had planned to set fire
<>to the palace and burn to death the Pa1n2d2avas. But, the
<>shrewd Vidura through his messenger Kanaka gave
<>notice of the conspiracy to the Pa1n2d2avas just in time.
<>One night Purocana set fire to the waxen palace, but
<>the Pa1n2d2avas escaped by a secret passage, which the
<>architect of the palace had made while constructing
<>it, and about which the Pa1n2d2avas had previous know-
<>ledge. The same night a huntsman, with his five children,
<>was also staying in the palace. As they were uncon-
<>scious with heavy dosage of liquor they could not es-
<>cape the fire. Those six people, and accidentally
<>Purocana too were burnt to death. People, who gather-
<>ed at the spot, thus saw seven corpses, and the news
<>was broadcast that the Pa1n2d2avas, including their wife
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 and their mother had been burnt to death.

<>permanent abode of these divine birds. They do not
<>like the rainy season. So they come down to the earth
<>when rain begins at the Ma1nasasaras, and go back to
<>the Saras, when rain begins on the earth. This pheno-
<>menon explains Cerus4s4eri's (Malayalam poet) state-
<>ment in his Kr2s2n2aga1tha1 that ‘when rain set in ham3sas
<>-Arayannams--began flying away’.

<>va1ka got Devatva (divinity). (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,

<>ted the story of an Arayanna to elaborate the stand taken
<>by the aged Bhi1s2ma. An aged Ham3sa (Arayanna) which
<>once dwelt on the sea-coast preached to all the other
<>birds much about ethical actions. The birds felt great res-
<>peet for the Arayanna. They flew across the sea in search
<>of prey after entrusting their eggs to the Arayanna. The
<>old Arayanna grew fat on those eggs. There was one
<>intelligent bird among the lot, and when it looked for
<>the eggs they were not to be found. That bird informed
<>its colleagues about the treacherous conduct of the
<>Arayanna. The birds organised themselves and attacked
<>the Arayanna to death. Oh! Bhi1s2ma, the same will be
<>your end also. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 41, Verses
<>30-41).
<NI>4) {%Nala and Arayanna.%} While Nala, the prince of the
<>Nis2adha kingdom was resting in a garden he saw an
<>Arayanna in a tank there. Out of curious pleasure Nala
<>caught it, but seeing its mental tremor he let it free.
<>Out of gratitude for this generous act, the Arayanna
<>played the role of the messenger for Nala to get as his
<>wife Damayanti1, the very beautiful daughter of the
<>King of Vidarbha.
<NI>5) {%How the Arayanna (Ham3sa) got the white colour.%} Once
<>king Marutta was conducting the Ma1hes4vara Satra
<>(a ya1ga) and Devas like Indra came down to receive
<>their share of the Havis (oblations in the sacrificial
<>fire). And, this was the time when Ra1van2a with his
<>attendants was on his triumphal tour. Hearing that the
<>Devas were at the A1s4rama of Marutta, Ra1van2a also
<>went there, and Indra and the other Devas, trembling
<>with fear, assumed different disguises and hid them-
<>selves away. Indra assumed the guise of the peacock,
<>Yama of the crow, Kubera of the chameleon and
<>Varun2a of the Arayanna. Thus beguiled Ra1van2a went
<>his own way. The Devas, who thus escaped blessed the
<>family of those birds whose forms they assumed. Indra
<>shaped the blue feathers of the peacock with mixed
<>colours and eyes like his own. Moreover, he blessed
<>them that they would never be affected with any
<>disease, and that they would dance with their feathers
<>spread when rain set in. Yamadharma blessed the [Page047-b+ 65]
<>crows that they would get the offerings made on earth
<>by men to their departed ancestors. And Bhagava1n
<>Varun2a told the Ra1ja-Ham3sas: “I escaped the clutches
<>of Ra1van2a by assuming your shape and form. Therefore,
<>be thee, who are now black and white, in future as
<>purely white as milk”. Kubera blessed the Chameleon
<>with capacity to change colour as and how it pleased,
<>and also for its cheeks to appear golden in colour to the
<>onlookers. After thus blessing the birds the Devas dis-
<>appeared. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>Mahars2i with the help of the Marutta and wedded
<>Rathavi1ti. Mahars2i S4ya1va1s4va was their son.

<>with its horns and bellowing like hell. But S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>faced the beast, and rained blows on him and it was

<HI>ARIS2T2ANEMI I. One of the six sons of Vinata1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Vis2n2u, Brahma1, Kas4yapa and Aris2t2anemi.
<>Kas4yapa married Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1, daughter of Daks2a. S4uki1
<>was their daughter, S4uki1 had a daughter Nata1 and

<>of Vinata1. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 40).
<NI>2) {%Tapas4s4akti of Aris2t2anemi.%} Aris2t2anemi with his son
<>was once performing tapas in the forest. The son was
<>immersed in meditation clad in the skin of a deer thus
<>looking like a deer. Parapuran5jaya, the King of Hehaya
<>who happened at the time to be hunting in the forest
<>discharged his arrow against the son of Aris2t2anemi taking
<>him for a deer. When the king found out the real fact
<>he felt extremely sorry, and he craved pardon of the
<>boy's father for unwittingly killing his son. Then Aris2t2a-
<>nemi pointing out his son who was standing alive
<>asked the King, “Is this the boy whom you killed?”
<>The King was naturally wonder-struck. But Aris2t2a-
<>nemi told the King that there was nothing to wonder
<>at in the case as nobody would be able to kill them be-
<>cause their Tapas4s4akti was so great. The King felt so
<>happy at this, and returned to his palace after prostrat-
<>ing at the feet of the sage. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 184).
<NI>3) {%Some other details.%} (1) Sumati, wife of King Sagara
<>of the Solar dynasty, was the daughter of Aris2t2anemi.
<>(Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 38, Verse 4). (2)

<HI>ARIS2T2ANEMI VI. A King. Realising the transient
<>nature of worldly life, he gave up his kingdom and
<>went to and did tapas at Mount Gandhama1dana. Indra
<>who was very much pleased at this sent a messenger
<>with a vima1na (aeroplane) to conduct the King to
<>Svarga (heaven). When he was told that there was in
<>Svarga also the states of being high or low, and fall
<>happened when the effect of good actions decreased,
<>the King gave up his desire for Svarga and sent back
<>Indra's messenger. Then Indra sent the King with a [Page048-b+ 65]
<>messenger to the A1s4rama of Va1lmi1ki so that he might
<>gain spiritual knowledge. Va1lmi1ki consoled the King
<>with the advice that the telling, hearing and pondering
<>over the story of the Ra1ma1yan2a alone would be enough
<>to get eternal salvation. (Yogava1sis2t2ham).
<HI>ARJUNA. The third of the Pa1n2d2avas.

<NI>2) {%Previous birth.%} Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a are often re-
<>ferred to as Narana1ra1yan2as (Nara and Na1ra1yan2a). In
<>their previous life they were two R2s2is called Nara and
<>Na1ra1yan2a, and from that time onwards they lived as
<>inseparable companions and sons of the same parents.
<>They entered Maha1sama1dhi at Badarya1s4rama in the
<>Hima1layas. Of the two Na1ra1yan2ars2i was a partial in-
<>carnation of Vis2n2u. About the Narars2i the Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata has the following to say: “Dharma had his
<>origin in the heart of Brahma1, and he earned great
<>reputation for truthfulness and adherence to Vedic
<>dharma. He married the daughters of Daks2a. Dharma
<>had four sons, Hari, Kr2s2n2a, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. Of
<>the four sons Hari and Kr2s2n2a became great yogi1s, and
<>Nara and Na1ra1yan2a, great tapasvins. Nara and Na1ra1-
<>yan2a did tapas, worshipping Brahma1 for 1000 years at
<>the holy Badarya1s4rama in the plains of the Hima1layas.
<>Nara was born in the next birth as Arjuna. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha). See Nara.
<NI>3) {%Birth.%} To Vicitravi1rya son of S4antanu was born
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra by Ambika1, and Pa1n2d2u by Amba1lika1.
<>Pa1n2d2u had two wives, Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. The curse of a
<>Muni made physical contacts with his wives impossible for
<>Pa1n2d2u. (See Pa1n2d2u). Kunti1, before her marriage had
<>attended on Mahars2i Durva1sas who pleased with her
<>service made a gift of five mantras to her. The effect
<>of the mantras was that Kunti1 would become mother of
<>a son from him about whom she was thinking while she
<>repeated the mantra. As soon as she got the mantras
<>she retired to a solitary place and thinking of the Sun-
<>God repeated the first mantra. At once Su1ryadeva appear-
<>ed and Karn2a was born to her by him. After assuring
<>her that the incident would not affect her chastity Su1rya
<>disappeared. Kunti1 abandoned the child to float in the
<>river Gan3ga1, and stayed with Pa1n2d2u keeping the other
<>four mantras to herself. Since Pa1n2d2u could not contact
<>the body of his wives, with his permission Kunti1 began
<>practising the other four mantras one by one. By three
<>mantras she got three sons, Dharmaputra from Ka1la,
<>Arjuna from Indra and Bhi1masena from the wind God
<>(Va1yu). The remaining one mantra Kunti1 gave to
<>Ma1dri1. She repeated it thinking of the As4vini1 Devas,
<>and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 63 onwards).
<NI>4) {%Festival of birth.%} At the birth of Arjuna Kunti1 heard
<>a heavenly voice declare as follows: “Oh! Kunti1!
<>your son will be equal to S4iva in prowess and uncon-
<>querable just as Indra is. After defeating all the Kings
<>he will perform the As4vamedha thrice. He will please [Page049-a+ 65]
<>S4iva and get the great weapon called Pa1s4upata from
<>him. On the orders of Indra he will kill Niva1takavacas.
<>Hearing the above prophecy the Devas played ecstatic
<>music and flowers were showered from the sky. The
<>Saptars2is, Praja1patis and other sages arrayed themselves
<>in the sky. Thus, all animate and inanimate objects
<>celebrated the birth of Arjuna.
<NI>5) {%Naming.%} Sages from the top of the S4atas4r2n3ga
<>mountain came together to perform the christening
<>ceremony of Arjuna. While enumerating the various
<>names of Arjuna, it is said in the Vira1t2a Parva that
<>Kr2s2n2a was the name Pa1n2d2u gave to his son. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 123, Verse 20).
<NI>6) {%Childhood.%} The Pa1n2d2avas spent their childhood at
<>Hastina1pura with the Kauravas. Then Arjuna studied
<>the art and science of using weapons, dance, music etc.
<>along with the other boys. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>129, Verse 1). Kas4yapa, the high priest of Vasudeva
<>did for Arjuna the usual Sam3ska1ras like Upanayana
<>(wearing of the holy thread) etc. Arjuna was taught
<>the first lessons in Dhanurveda (Science of archery)
<>by Ra1jars2i S4uka. Afterwards, Kr2pa1ca1rya became the
<>preceptor of the Pa1n2d2avas in Dhanurveda, and it was
<>then that Dron2a1ca1rya came. There is a particular story
<>about Dron2a1ca1rya becoming the guru. (See Dron2a).
<NI>7) {%Special favour of Dron2a.%} Arjuna showed very great
<>interest in the science of the use of weapons. Dron2a, the
<>master, wanted to teach As4vattha1ma1, his son, certain
<>special things, and he began sending all his disciples to
<>fetch water. As4vattha1ma1 used to be the first to return
<>with the water, and before the others returned Dron2a
<>began teaching As4vattha1ma1 the special lessons. Arjuna
<>came to understand this programme and he began
<>returning with water along with As4vattha1ma1. Then
<>the guru began teaching the special things to both
<>As4vattha1ma1 and Arjuna. Dron2a instructed the cook
<>not to serve Arjuna food in the darkness. While
<>Arjuna was once taking his food, wind blew out the
<>burning lamp, and Arjuna alone continued eating.
<>Because of constant practice Arjuna was quite sure
<>about the position of the hand and the mouth in
<>the process of eating, and Arjuna surmised from this
<>that archery also could be practised in darkness. He
<>began practising them. The guru came to know of it,
<>and witnessing Arjuna's performance praised Arjuna as
<>a unique archer. (Bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 132).
<NI>8) {%Ekalavya's finger was cut.%} Ekalavya, son of Hiran2ya-
<>dhanus, King of the Nis2a1das (a tribe of hunters, forest-
<>men) approached Dron2a to learn the science of the
<>use of weapons. Dron2a, the Brahmin, refused the prayer
<>of this prince of the forest tribe. Ekalavya, after pros-
<>trating at the feet of Dron2a returned to the woods,
<>made an image of Dron2a with earth and meditating
<>upon it as guru began practising the use of weapons.
<NI>The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas went hunting in the
<>forest. Seeing there Ekalavya with his matted hair and
<>clad in deer skin the hunting dogs began barking at
<>him. Ekalavya shot into the mouth of the dog seven
<>arrows at one and the same moment. With the arrows
<>thrust in the mouth the dogs ran back to the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>and they found out the culprit, Ekalavya, who claimed
<>himself to be a disciple of Dron2a. Grief-stricken at this
<>claim Arjuna hurried up to Dron2a and said: “You had
<>pronounced me to be your foremost disciple without an
<>equal. But, today Ekalavya, another disciple of yours [Page049-b+ 64]
<>has relegated me to the second place”. Thereupon
<>Dron2a went and saw Ekalavya in the forest. Ekalavya,
<>in all devotion stood up and saluted the guru. And
<>the guru said as follows: “Oh! Ekalavya if thou
<>art my disciple give me the daks2in2a1 (fee) due to the
<>guru, and I desire to get the thumb of your right hand as
<>my fee”. At once Ekalavya cut his thumb and gave it to
<>Dron2a. Henceforth Arjuna became Dron2a's unequalled
<>disciple. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 132).
<NI>9) {%Arjuna got Brahmas4ira1stra.%} When once Dron2a and
<>his disciples were bathing in the river Gan3ga1, a whale
<>caught hold of the leg of the guru. The combined
<>efforts of the disciples failed to extricate the leg from
<>the grip of the whale. Ultimately Arjuna shot an arrow
<>and released the guru's leg. Greatly pleased at this
<>Dron2a imparted to Arjuna knowledge about Brahma-
<>s4ira1stra, and Arjuna was enjoined not to use the astra
<>against men, but to use it only when confronting
<>higher beings than men. [Bha1rata (Malayalam), A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 133].
<NI>10) {%Competition in arms.%} When the training of the princes
<>was almost over Dhr2tara1s2t2ra decided to have a rehear-
<>sal of their attainments, and the scene for it also was
<>set. The princes with bows and arrows appeared on
<>the scene. Yudhis2t2hira and others first exhibited their
<>skill in shooting arrows in the order of their seniority.
<>Every scene was explained to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra by Vidura
<>and to Ga1ndha1ri1 by San5jaya. Duryodhana and
<>Bhi1ma clashed with each other. As4vattha1ma1 pacified
<>them and kept them apart. And, then Arjuna and
<>Karn2a appeared on the scene, and the onlookers dec-
<>lared them to be equal in skill in archery. When
<>their shooting exhibition was over, Karn2a who got
<>angry again rushed to the stage. Arjuna also got
<>ready. Arjuna challenged Karn2a's eligibility on the
<>ground that he was low-born and not a Ks2atriya. At
<>once Duryodhana proclaimed him as the King of An3ga.
<>Though this pacified the scene, this competition in
<>archery served much to make the Kauravas and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas the bitterest of enemies. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapters, 136, 137).
<NI>11) {%Arjuna's gurudaks2in2a1 (Offering of fee to the preceptor).%}
<>At the starting of training the princes Dron2a told them:
<>“I have one thing in mind, and you must do it for
<>me when you have completed the course of training.
<>All the disciples except Arjuna kept silent at this, but
<>Arjuna promised to fulfil the guru's wish at the
<>proper time
<NI>The training was over, and it was time for gurudaks2in2a1.
<>Dron2a asked to be brought bound before him Drupada,
<>King of Pa1n5ca1la. (For Dron2a's enmity towards Dru-
<>pada see Drupada). Thereupon the Pa1n2d2avas marched
<>to Pa1n5ca1la, and in a fierce battle Arjuna defeated
<>Drupada. Though Bhi1ma tried to kill Drupada Arjuna
<>did not permit it, but took him bound to Dron2a.
<>This ended Dron2a's hatred towards Drupada, who
<>now gifted half his kingdom to Dron2a. Dron2a was
<>very much pleased with Arjuna for the above act,
<>and advised him to fight even him (Dron2a) if the
<>latter opposed him (Arjuna). To this Arjuna replied
<>‘Yes’. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 139, Verse 14). With
<>this promise to fight even the guru in case the guru
<>attacked him Arjuna became the most reputed archer
<>in Bha1rata. [Page050-a+ 65]
<NI>12) {%Jealousy of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.%} After the gurudaks2in2a1 Arjuna
<>marched against the neighoouring kingdom. He de-
<>feated very easily in war the King of Yavana and the
<>Kings Sauvi1ra, Vipula and Sumitra. These victories of
<>Arjuna made the Kauravas very anxious; Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>brooded over it. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 138, Verses
<>20-23).
<NI>13) {%Escape from the waxen palace.%} Duryodhana made
<>up his mind to destroy the Pa1n2d2avas somehow or
<>other. He got the Pa1n2d2avas to shift their residence to
<>a palace made of wax at Va1ran2a1vata, and one year after
<>this the palace was set fire to. The Pa1n2d2avas escaped
<>death by fire through a tunnel and entered the forest,
<>the next day. (See Arakkillam).
<NI>14) {%Arjuna on the banks of river Ga ga1.%} The Pa1n2d2avas walk-
<>ed much through the terrible forest, and after midnight
<>reached the banks of the Gan3ga1. At that time Am3ga1ra-
<>parn2a (Citraratha), the Gandharva was enjoying
<>his time in the river with some Apsara1 women. The
<>presence of men at the scene, the Gandharva did not
<>relish. Arjuna and the Gandharva crossed in words,
<>which led to a duel. In the duel the Gandharva was
<>defeated. As the wife of the Gandharva prayed with
<>tears in her eyes Arjuna spared him his life. The
<>grateful Gandharva told the Pa1n2d2avas many interesting
<>stories. He also made a present of divine horses and
<>imparted to them the esoteric knowledge called Ca1ks2us2i1-
<>vidya1. The Gandharva finally told the Pa1n2d2avas that
<>they were attacked because they came without Agni and
<>A1huti in their front. He also explained this fact that
<>Arjuna could subjugate him on account of his (Arjuna's)
<>genuine celibacy. (See Citraratha).
<NI>15) {%Pa1n5ca1lisvayam3vara.%} Citraratha, during his talks
<>with the a1n2d2avas had pointed out to them the need to
<>have a priest to lead and guide them in all matters,
<>and accordingly they visited Dhaumya1s4rama and ins-
<>talled the Mahars2i (Dhaumya) as their priest.
<NI>And, meantime seeing thousands of people on their way
<>to attend the Svayam3vara (marriage by open choice
<>of husband by the girl) of Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1) daughter
<>of the King of a1n5ca1la, the Pa1n2d2avas also followed the
<>crowd. Veda Vya1sa, whom the Pa1n2d2avas met on their
<>way blessed them. King Drupada wished to give his
<>daughter Kr2s2n2a1 in marriage to Arjuna. The news that
<>the n2d2a as were burned to death in the palace of
<>wax grieved Drupada. Yet he had made arrangements for
<>a trial of strength by Heroes at the Svayam3vara. A
<>tremendous bow was got ready and installed on the
<>ground, and a machine constructed which was kept
<>suspended in the air. The target was placed inside
<>the machine. And then Drupada spoke thus: “My
<>daughter shall be married to him who will bend the
<>bow and with the first arrow hit the target placed
<>inside the machine”. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 155,
<>Verse 11). Great warriors like Duryodhana, Karn2a,
<>S4is4upa1la, S4im3s4uma1ra took their seats in the marriage
<>hall. All the kings failed even to lift the bow up. Ulti-
<>mately Arjuna lifted the bow and hit the target very
<>easily. Pa1n5ca1li1 put the wedding garland on Arjuna's
<>neck. When the Pa1n2d2avas returned to their mother
<>with Pa1n5ca1li1 in the evening the mother from inside her
<>room said: “What you have got today, my sons, you
<>enjoy among yourselves.” Kunti1 said this under the
<>impression that what her sons had got was some
<>Bhiks2a1. At any rate, in obedience to the above injunc- [Page050-b+ 65]

<>during a particular year if any other husband than the
<>one whose turn it was to live with Pa1n5ca1li1 saw her the

<NI>Once a brahmin came to the palace complaining that

<NI>17B) {%The mark on Arjuna's flag is Hanu1ma1n, and the
<>following story is attached to it.%} Arjuna, once during a
<>tour of the country was much surprised to see the Dam
<>constructed by S4ri1 Ra1ma from Ra1mes4vara to Lan3ka1.
<>He also felt that it was not at all proper on the part
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma to have sought the help of monkeys to
<>construct the dam. S4ri1 Ra1ma could have made a dam
<>with arrows. Arjuna put this question to a great
<>scholar (Pandit) who was sitting nearby reading the
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. Neither the Pandit nor the other brahmins
<>gathered there could give a convincing answer to Ar-
<>juna's doubts. Then a monkey child went up to Arjuna
<>and told him with pride that a dam made of arrows
<>would have broken when the monkeys walked on it.
<>Arjuna said then, “no, no, no monkey will be able to
<>break the dam built with Ra1ma's arrows; which monkey
<>will break a dam of arrows made even by me?” And,
<>a debate began about the subject. The monkey and
<>Arjuna agreed to a bet that if a monkey broke the dam
<>made by Arjuna he would end his life by jumping into
<>fire, and if the monkey could not break the dam it
<>would for ever be Arjuna's slave. Arjuna constructed
<>a dam with arrows. And, as soon as the monkey set
<>foot on it it was broken. Arjuna tried again. Though
<>now it caused some efforts on the part of the monkey
<>the dam broke this time also. Arjuna was thus left with
<>no alternative but to die by jumping into fire and a
<>fire was accordingly lit. Before Arjuna jumped into the
<>fire a brahmin boy, who was bathing in the river ran [Page051-a+ 65]
<>upto Arjuna and told him that his attempt at self
<>annihilation was not justified as the bet was made with-
<>out an arbiter. When Arjuna who was wedded so
<>much to truth brushed aside this argument and got
<>ready to end his life the boy said: “If you are so very
<>insistent about it you (Arjuna and the monkey) com-
<>pete once again with me as arbiter. This suggestion of
<>the boy was accepted. The monkey child tried its best
<>to break the dam, but it failed. It developed its body
<>to the size of a mountain and jumped on the dam.
<>Even then it did not break. Then he ran up to the boy
<>who was acting as arbiter and prostrated at his feet
<>crying ‘Ra1macandra’. At the same moment Arjuna
<>also prostrated before the boy crying ‘S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, slave
<>to devotees’. The boy asked both of them to get up,
<>and after admonishing them for their conceit gave them
<>good advice. He also asked the monkey child to keep
<>his word by remaining as the emblem of Arjuna's flag.
<NI>(The monkey boy was actually Hanu1ma1n and the
<>brahmin boy S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>17C) {%Arjuna married Subhadra1.%} Arjuna went to the holy
<>place called Saubhadrati1rtha and redeemed the woman
<>named Varga1 from the curse she was labouring under.
<>(See Varga1). Arjuna continued his journey and reached
<>Gokarn2a and Prabha1sa ti1rtha, where he met Gada,
<>brother of S4ri1 kr2s2n2a. Gada described to Arjuna the
<>great beauty of his sister, Subhadra1. Arjuna went to
<>Dva1raka1 and paid his respects to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. A few days
<>later the ya1davas celebrated a great festival at mount
<>Raivataka. Arjuna went there disguised as a Sannya1sin
<>and forcibly took away Subhadra1 with him with the
<>permission of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Though the ya1davas got ready
<>for a fight they were ultimately pacified, and Subhadra1
<>was married to Arjuna. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter,
<>218-224).
<NI>17D) {%Brahmin boy saved.%} When once Arjuna was in
<>Dva1raka1 with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a a brahmin appeared on the
<>scene lamenting that his child died as soon as it was
<>born. Nobody paid any heed to this, and then Arjuna
<>rose up and assured protection to the next child to be
<>born to the brahmin and asked him to return home in
<>peace. Arjuna also vowed that he would end his life
<>by jumping into fire if he failed to protect the next
<>child of the brahmin.
<NI>As the time for the delivery of his wife approached the
<>brahmin took Arjuna home. Arjuna made the house
<>secure by making an enclosure with his arrows. Yet
<>the child died; not only that, at the time of birth it-
<>self its body disappeared. And, the brahmin heaped
<>insults on Arjuna, who looked very foolish. Rendered
<>thus an object of ridicule Arjuna began to make a fire
<>for him to jump into. At this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a appeared be-
<>fore Arjuna and prevented him from jumping into fire.
<>And then both Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna went to Vis2n2uloka
<>and submitted the case of the brahmin to him. Vis2n2u
<>told them: “Oh! Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna, it was I who took
<>away the brahmin boys for the pleasure of seeing you
<>both here. You may immediately return with the brah-
<>min boys. And, Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna returned with the
<>boys to the brahmin, who now felt very happy.

<>were spending their days on the banks of river Yamuna1

<>Agni Bhagava1n, who presented to Arjuna the bow
<>called Ga1n2d2i1va, a white horse and many other power-

<>sent a heavy shower of rain. By creating a tent with
<>arrows Arjuna saved the forest from the rain. Arjuna
<>killed Taks2aka's wife, cursed the N ga called As4vasena
<>and saved Maya, the architect of the Asuras who was

<>divine arrows to Arjuna. Maya gave the famous conch,
<>Devadattam to Arjuna. By now the one year of the

<NI>18) {%Again to the forest.%} Maya, who escaped death in
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest, in his great gratitude, went to Indra-
<>prastha, and with the permission of Dharmaputra built
<>for the Pa1n2d2avas an exceptionally beautiful palace.
<>And then the Pa1n2d2avas made the conquest of all the
<>earth, and after killing enemy kings like Jara1sandha,
<>the Kimpurus2as, the Ha1dakas, S4is4upa1la, Kurundha and
<>Bhagadatta returned to Idraprastha and performed
<>the Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a. The Kauravas who got jealous at
<>this went on a visit to Indraprastha. When they enter-
<>ed the palace built by Maya they were put into many
<>a ludicrous situation. (See Sabha1praves4a). Insulted
<>and humiliated they returned to Hastina1pura and
<>challenged the Pa1n2d2avas to a game of dice, and in the
<>game the Pa1n2d2avas lost not only their kingdom and
<>other riches, but Pa1n5ca1li1 as well. Dus4s4a1sana dragged
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 and stripped her of her clothes in the royal
<>assembly and thus mercilessly insulted her. According
<>to the terms and condition agreed to with reference to
<>the game of dice, the Pa1n2d2avas had to lead forest life
<>for twelve years and live for one year incognito. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas again started for the forest. (M.B., Sabha1
<>Parva).
<NI>19) {%Pa1n2d2avas in Ka1myaka forest.%} A number of brahmins
<>also accompanied the Pa1n2d2avas to the forest. The noble
<>brahmin, S4aunaka consoled the aggrieved Dharma-
<>putra in the Dvaitavana. Dharmaputra felt worried
<>that he could not feed the brahmins who accompanied
<>him into the forest. Pa1n5ca1li1 prayed to the Sun-God,
<>and he gave the Aks2ayapa1tra to her. (See Aks2yapa1tra).
<>And, after this the Pa1n2d2avas, along with the brahmins,
<>entered the Ka1myaka forest. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 36).
<NI>20) {%Arjuna secured divine arrows.%} Dharmaputra asked
<>Arjuna to do tapas in the Hima1layas and thus secure
<>divine arrows. Accordingly Arjuna went south and saw
<>Indra in the Indraki1la mountain. Indra gave him
<>boons. There Arjuna killed Mu1ka1sura. And, then
<>Arjuna went to Mount Kaila1sa and prayerfully concen-
<>trated his mind on S4iva. S4iva appeared in the guise of
<>a forest dweller. (See Pa1s4upata1stra). After that he got
<>the Dan2d2a1stra from Yama, Pa1s4a1stra from Varun2a and
<>Antardha1na1stra from Kubera. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapters 37-41).
<NI>21) {%Arjuna in Indraloka.%} Indra, who was so very pleas-
<>ed that Arjuna got so many divine arrows deputed his
<>charioteer, Ma1tali, to bring Arjuna to Devaloka, and
<>at Devaloka he learned more about archery and music.
<>The Apsara1 women forgot themselves when they saw
<>the exceptionally handsome Arjuna. Urvas4i1, mad with [Page052-a+ 65]
<>love, sent her messenger Citrasena to Indra. Being told
<>about Urvas4i1's love Arjuna closed both his ears with
<>hands, and reminded the messenger of Urvas4i1's mater-
<>nal position with reference to him. Urvas4i1 cursed and
<>turned Arjuna into an eunuch. Indra consoled Arjuna
<>by assuring him that Urvas4i1's curse will turn out to be
<>of great benefit to him. Afterwards Arjuna stayed in
<>Devaloka for a few days with Citrasena, and during
<>the period he killed Niva1takavaca and Ka1lakeya.
<NI>Arjuna became a friend of Mahars2i Lomas4a, who had
<>gone to Devaloka to see Indra. Promising Arjuna that
<>he would protect Dharmaputra Lomas4a returned to the
<>earth. Arjuna left the Ka1myaka forest and returned to
<>his brothers after an absence for five years. He met the
<>brothers at Mount Gandhama1dana. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapters 42-47).
<NI>22) {%Procession.%} At last a witty and humorous brahmin
<>went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and dilated upon the hardships
<>being suffered by the Pa1n2d2avas, and Duryodhana and
<>others were extremely pleased and happy to hear it.
<>Yet, they shed crocodile tears. But, Duryodhana was
<>in a mighty hurry to see with his own eyes the pitiable
<>plight of the Pa1n2d2avas. On the pretext of going out for
<>hunting Duryodhana and others with the permission of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, started for the forest with a number of
<>attendants. 8,000 chariots, 30,000 elephants, thousands
<>of infantry soldiers, 9,000 horses, merchants, ornaments,
<>courtesans and thousands of hunters formed this pro-
<>cession into the forest. Just like roaring winds during
<>the rainy season the procession caused thunderous noise.
<>Duryodhana approached the pool in the Dvaita forest
<>and waited at a distance. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 239, Verses 25-29).
<NI>Duryodhana and attendants put up tents in the forest.
<>The Gandharvas obstructed Duryodhana, and he and
<>the Gandharva called Citrasena clashed with each
<>other. Duryodhana was made a prisoner. Arjuna came
<>on the scene and released him. And, thus humiliated
<>Duryodhana returned to Hastina1pura with the atten-
<>dants. (M.B., A1ran2ya Parva, Chapters 239-253).
<NI>23) {%Arjuna lost consciousness.%} While once Pa1n5ca1li1 was
<>alone King Jayadratha forcibly took her away. Within
<>seconds the Pa1n2d2avas confronted Jayadratha and regain-
<>ed Pa1n5ca1li1. Jayadratha and his men were killed. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas, who were very weary and tired walking in
<>the forest felt extremely thirsty. Nakula, at the instance
<>of Dharmaputra climbed a tree and looked around and
<>sighted a pool of clear water. When Nakula went to the
<>pool and began to draw water a voice from above was
<>heard saying as follows: “Do not be so very daring.
<>This is my ancestral wealth. If you answer my ques-
<>tions you may not only drink the water but also take
<>some with you”. Without paying any heed to this warn-
<>ing Nakula drank water from the pool, and lo! he fell
<>down unconscious immediately. Sahadeva who went to
<>the pool in search of Nakula and drank water from the
<>pool also met with the same fate as Nakula. Arjuna
<>and Bhi1ma also had the same fate at the pool. Lastly
<>Dharmaputra went to the pool and understanding what
<>happened to his brothers requested permission to drink
<>water. At once a Yaks2a appeared and brought the bro-
<>thers of Dharmaputra back to consciousness. In fact,
<>the Yaks2a was none other than Yamadharmadeva. (For
<>questions and answers of the Yaks2a see Dharmaputra.)
<>(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chapters 312-315). [Page052-b+ 65]
<NI>24) {%Life incognito.%} Now the twelve years of forest life
<>being over the Pa1n2d2avas decided to spend the one year
<>of life incognito in the Vira1t2a palace. Arjuna disguised
<>himself and deposited his clothes and weapons in the
<>hollow of a S4ami tree in the forest. And the Pa1n2d2avas
<>in various disguises reached the Vira1t2a palace. They
<>assumed false names: Dharmaputra as Kan3ka, Bhi1ma
<>as Vala1la, Arjuna as Br2hannala, Nakula as Granthika
<>and Sahadeva as Aris2t2anemi and Draupadi1 as Ma1lini1.
<NI>When the life incognito of the Pa1n2d2avas for one year
<>was about to expire a rumour reached the Kauravas
<>that the Pa1n2d2avas were at the Vira1t2a capital, and the
<>Kauravas thought that the Pa1n2d2avas will appear on the
<>scene if a war was fought against King Vira1t2a. The
<>Kauravas, with this object in view, lifted the cows of
<>Vira1t2a and that led to war. Uttara, the prince of Vira1t2a
<>boasted that he would fight provided he had a good
<>charioteer. Br2hannala (Arjuna) agreed to act as such
<>and they started for the warfield. At the sight of the
<>massive army of the Kauravas Uttara got frightened
<>and tried to run away from the field. But Br2hannala
<>tightly bound Uttara to the chariot, drove it very fast
<>to the forest, took back from the hollow of the S4ami
<>tree his weapons and returned to the battle-field. The
<>Kauravas were absolutely defeated in the war and they
<>took to their heels. They understood that the very clever
<>and terrible warrior in disguise was Arjuna himself. But,
<>by the time the period of the Pa1n2d2avas life incognito
<>was over. The king of Vira1t2a, greatly pleased over this
<>victory in war gave his daughter, Uttara1 in marriage to
<>Abhim3anyu, son of Arjuna. (M.B., Vira1t2a Parva).
<NI>25) {%Preparations for war.%} After the forest life and life
<>incognito the Pa1n2d2avas returned. The Kauravas refus-
<>ed to give them half the Kingdom. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, on behalf
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas, implored that half the kingdom or five
<>districts or five houses or at least one house be given to
<>them. But the Kauravas took the stand that not even
<>an iota of land would be given to the Pa1n2d2avas. And,
<>war was perforce decided upon. Duryodhana went to
<>Kr2s2n2a at Dva1raka1 to request for support in war. Kr2s2n2a,
<>who favoured the Pa1n2d2avas lay in false sleep as he did
<>not want to fight against them. Duryodhana sat at the
<>head of Kr2s2n2a. Arjuna, who came after some time sat
<>at the feet of Kr2s2n2a and remained there standing.
<>Awakening from sleep, it was Arjuna whom Kr2s2n2a saw
<>first. After the greetings were over with Arjuna, Kr2s2n2a
<>saw Duryodhana also. Between Kr2s2n2a without any arms
<>and the armed forces of Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna chose Kr2s2n2a
<>and Duryodhana his armed forces to help each side in
<>the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<NI>26) {%War.%} Both the Parties were encamped in Kuruk-
<>s2etra ready for war. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a acted as Charioteer to
<>Arjuna. He stopped the chariot in between the opposing
<>armies. Arjuna felt deep anguish to find his own people
<>arrayed on the opposite side for war. Reluctant to kill
<>relations, elders, friends and preceptors Arjuna laid
<>down his arms in the chariot. Then did Kr2s2n2a instruct
<>him in Karmayoga (the philosophy of action). That
<>instruction and advice of Kr2s2n2a is the world-famous
<>Bhagavad Gi1ta1. The Gi1ta1 cleared off Arjuna's illusions
<>and he praised the Lord, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, who revealed his
<>all comprehensive form (Vis4varu1pa) to Arjuna.
<NI>On the first day of the war Arjuna fought a duel with
<>Bhi1s2ma, and the second day he fought the Kaurava
<>forces with exceptional prowess. And then Arjuna pre- [Page053-a+ 64]
<>vented Kr2s2n2a from killing Bhi1s2ma. But, the Kaurava
<>army faced defeat that day. On the third day Arjuna
<>defeated Bhi1s2ma, As4vattha1ma1, Trigartta, Bhagadatta
<>and others. Thereupon a really fierce fight began. The
<>war lasted for 18 days. The important incidents during
<>the 18 days can be summarised as follows:--
<>(1) Fierce fight between Arjuna and Bhi1s2ma.
<>(2) Fight between Arjuna and As4vattha1ma1.

<>after digvijaya Arjuna was killed by the arrows of his
<>son, Babhruva1hana. Immediately did Ulu1pi1, Arjuna's
<>wife bring back to life her husband by Mr2tasan5ji1vani1

<>prastha1na Parva, Chapter 1, Verses 1-42). The Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas continued their journey, Yudhis2t2hira leading them.
<>They reached the Hima1layas, and there Pa1n5ca1li1 expir-
<>ed. To Bhi1ma's querry as to why Pa1n5ca1li1 expired first,
<>Yudhis2t2hira replied that it was due to her having been
<>more partial to Arjuna. The others continued their
<>journey and then Sahadeva died. Yudhis2t2hira explain-
<>ed that Sahadeva died second due to his arrogance
<>and conceit. And, the others continued going forward.
<>An emaciated dog was already with the Pa1n2d2avas
<>during their journey. Nakula was the third to die, and
<>Yudhis2t2hira attributed it to his (Nakula) extreme con-
<>ceit about his beauty. And, Arjuna's death next,
<>Yudhis2t2hira said, was due to his having not kept his
<>vow, once made, to kill the whole lot of enemies in a
<>day. After proceeding a short distance further Bhi1ma
<>also fell dead, and Yudhis2t2hira thought to himself
<>that it was due to Bhi1ma's voracious eating. And, then
<>Devendra came in his chariot of gold and welcomed
<>Yudhis2t2hira to Svarga. But, he refused the offer saying
<>that he would not do go alone, leaving his brothers
<>behind. When Indra assured him that his brothers
<>were already there, in Svarga, Yudhis2t2hira got into
<>the chariot and reached Svarga, and he was elated to
<>find his brothers there happy with Pa1n5ca1li1. (Maha1-
<>prastha1na Parva and Svarga1rohan2a).

<NI>Once, the son of an old Brahmin woman Gautami1,
<>died on account of snake-bite. A hunter caught and
<>brought before Gautami1 the snake. His object was to
<>kill it immediately. But the serpent proved its innocence
<>by pleading that it bit the boy impelled and prompted
<>by Death. At once death (mr2tyu) appeared on the
<>scene and explained that it was prompted by the God
<>of Death. And, it was the child who was responsible for
<>the cause of death, and Gautami1 was the cause for the
<>birth of the child. Ultimately Gautami1 herself assumed
<>responsibility for the sin. Bhi1s2ma consoled Dharma-
<>putra by telling that as in the case of Gautami1 in

<>of Karma. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 1). [Page055-a+ 65]

<HI>ARUN2A I.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Son of Kas4yapa by Vinata1. Kas4yapa, son
<>of Brahma1, married Vinata1 and Kadru1, and being so
<>much pleased by their services he gave them boons.
<>Kadru1 got the boon to have 1000 na1ga (serpent) sons,
<>and Vinata1 to have two sons more powerful and vital
<>than the sons of Kadru1. After this Kas4yapa went into
<>the forest again for Tapas. After a period, Kadru1 gave
<>birth to 1000 eggs and Vinata1 to two. Both the mothers
<>kept their eggs in pots so that they were in the right
<>temperature. After 500 years the pot broke up and
<>Kadru1 had her 1000 sons. Vinata1 felt pained at this
<>and opened one of her pots. A child only half-developed
<>emerged from the egg and he was Arun2a. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 16, Verses 5-7). After another 500
<>years the other egg of Vinata1 hatched itself and a glow-
<>ing son emerged. He was Garud2a.
<NI>2) {%Genealogy.%} While Ra1ma and Laks2man2a wandered
<>in the forest searching for Si1ta1 they saw the wounded
<>and disabled Jat2a1yu. Jat2a1yu described his genealogy
<>as follows: “Kas4yapa, son of Brahma1, married the
<>daughters of Daks2a. Of the two wives, Vinata1 delivered
<>two sons, Garud2a and Arun2a. Sampa1ti was Arun2a's
<>elder son and he (Jat2a1yu) the younger. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 14). Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 19 also refers to Garud2a and Arun2a as the sons
<>of Vinata1.
<NI>3) {%Arun2a curses his mother.%} The fact of Vinata1 forcing
<>open one of her eggs prematurely and Arun2a emerging
<>out of it with only a half-developed body has been
<>mentioned above. Arun2a got angry at the haste of his
<>mother and cursed her to live as slave of Kadru1 for
<>500 years, and then Garud2a would redeem her from
<>slavery. He also asked her to wait for 500 years so that
<>the birth of another physically deficient son like him-
<>self might be avoided. After pronouncing this curse Arun2a [Page055-b+ 65]
<>rose to the sky. This curse was the reason for Vinata1's
<>becoming a slave of Kadru1. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>16, Verses 18-23).
<NI>4) {%Arun2a became charioteer of Sun.%} The Sun and the
<>Moon betrayed to the Devas Ra1hu, who waited at the
<>entrance of Devaloka to snatch off the Nectar (Amr2tam)
<>got at the churning of the sea of milk (Ks2i1ra1bdhi).
<>Thenceforth Ra1hu does often swallow the Sun and the
<>Moon. That phenomenon is called the eclipse (of the Sun
<>or Moon. Su1rya-grahan2a and Candra-grahan2a). Enraged
<>by these frequent attacks of Ra1hu, the Sun-God began
<>once to burn like anything. Murmuring that everyone
<>would cooperate when there was something to be achiev-
<>ed, but would go on their own way when the object was
<>achieved, the Sun-God began burning so virulently as
<>to destroy all living forms, and the Devas were frighten-
<>ed by this and took refuge in Brahma1. Brahma1 called
<>Arun2a and asked him to stand as charioteer in front
<>of the Sun-God everyday so that the Sun's intensity
<>might be reduced. From that day onwards Arun2a has
<>been functioning as the charioteer of the Sun. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 24, Verses 15-20).
<NI>5) {%Birth of sons.%} S4yeni1, wife of Arun2a delivered two
<>sons, Sampa1ti and Jat2a1yu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>68, Verse 71).
<NI>6) {%Arun2a assumed female form.%} S4i1la1vati1, the chaste
<>woman, once did naked Tapas to redeem her husband,
<>Ugratapas from the consequences of a curse. The object
<>of her tapas was to prevent the next dawn (Sunrise).
<>Owing to the intensity of her tapas the Sun ceased to
<>rise, and this gave his charioteer Arun2a some rest. Then
<>it was that Arun2a came to know of a programme of
<>naked dance by the women in Devaloka. Women alone
<>were admitted to the dance hall. Arun2a, therefore, assum-
<>ed female form and sat among the Deva women, and
<>the beautiful ‘female’ kindled erotic sentiments in Indra
<>and he enjoyed a night with ‘her’. Also, a son was born
<>to them. And, before the day dawned Arun2a, at the ins-
<>tance of Indra entrusted the child to Ahalya1devi1 and re-
<>turned to join duty as the Sun-God's charioteer. (Arun2a,
<>while he acted as Indra's wife was called A1run2i1devi1).
<>Arun2a was a bit late to report for duty, and when
<>questioned by Sun he detailed the happenings during
<>the last night. This evoked the desire in the Sun to see
<>Arun2a in female form. Arun2a did so, and the Sun en-
<>joyed her. This also resulted in the birth of a son, who
<>too was, at the instance of the Sun, entrusted to Ahalya1-
<>devi1. Ahalya1devi1 brought both the children with tender
<>love, which Gautama muni, her husband did not like.
<>He cursed them and turned them into monkeys. After
<>some time Indra went to Ahalya1 to see his child and he
<>was told the story of Gautama's curse. Indra searched
<>out both the monkeys. In view of the elder one having a
<>long tail he was called Ba1li (Va1li) and the neck of the
<>second one being very beautiful, he was named Sugri1va.
<>At that time, R2ks2ara1ja, the monkey King of Kis2kindha1
<>was very unhappy because he had no sons. He came to
<>know of Ba1li and Sugri1va, and requested Indra to give
<>both the monkeys to him as sons. Indra gladly obliged
<>him. Indra blessed Ba1li to the effect that half the
<>strength of anybody who attacked him would be added
<>to his own natural power. Indra then sent him and
<>Sugri1va to Kis2kindha1.

<>deputed a messenger to challenge Indra for war. At that
<>time a heavenly voice called out that as long as Arun2a
<>did not give up the Ga1yatri1 he could not be worsted in
<>war. Then the Devas sent Br2haspati to Arun2a to make
<>him give up Ga1yatri1. Arun2a questioned Br2haspati as to
<>why he of the enemy camp had come to him (Arun2a).
<>Br2haspati replied: “You and I are not different; both

<HI>ARVA1VASU. An ancient Ascetic who had been a lumi-
<>nary in the Durbar hall of King Yudhis2t2hira. There
<>is a story in the Maha1bha1rata showing the merits of
<>penance of Arva1vasu. This story was told by the her-
<>mit Lomas4a to the Pa1n2d2avas, when they arrived at the
<>holy bath Madhugilasaman3ga, during their exile in
<>the forest. “Long ago two ascetics Raibhya and Bhara-
<>dva1ja had built their hermitages and lived here. A son
<>named Yavakri1ta was born to Bharadva1ja. To Raibh-
<>ya, two sons called Arva1vasu and Para1vasu were born.
<>Raibhya and his sons were learned men. Bharadva1ja and
<>Yavakri1ta became ascetics. Yavakri1ta started doing
<>penance with a view to get the boon of learning com-
<>ing to him automatically without getting it directly
<>from Brahmins. When his penance became severe Indra
<>appeared and told him that the boon he asked for was
<>an impossibility and tried to dissuade him from his
<>attempt. Yavakri1ta was not willing to give up penance.
<>Later Indra came in the guise of a Brahmin to the [Page057-a+ 63]
<>Banks of the Ganges and began to build a dam with
<>sand particles. Yavakri1ta said that it was an impossible
<>task. Indra said that the desire of Yavakri1ta also was
<>as impossible as that. Still Yavakri1ta did not show any
<>intention of drawing back. Finally Indra granted him
<>the boon.
<NI>Yavakri1ta returned to the hermitage. Full of arrogance
<>he hankered after the daughter-in-law of Raibhya.
<>Raibhya plucked a tuft of hair from his head and put
<>it as oblation in fire and created a giant who killed
<>Yavakri1ta. Bharadva1ja felt sad and cursed Raibhya
<>that he would be killed by his son. Then with Yava-
<>kri1ta he jumped into the fire and died.
<NI>At that time Br2haddyumna, a Brahmin performed a
<>sacrifice. He invited Arva1vasu and Para1vasu as helpers.
<>As Para1vasu was going along the forest he saw his father
<>covered with the hide of a deer and shot at him think-
<>ing him to be a deer. He stealthily informed the matter
<>to Arva1vasu. Arva1vasu went to the forest completed the
<>funeral rites of his father and returned. Para1vasu spread
<>the rumour everywhere that Arva1vasu had murdered
<>his father. In the innocence of Arva1vasu, nobody
<>believed. Everyone avoided him. He became sad and
<>forlorn and went to the forest and did penance to the
<>Sun. The Sun appeared before him and blessed him.
<>He returned and brought Yavakri1ta, Bharadva1ja and
<>Raibhya to life again.
<NI>All these occurrences happened in this bath called
<>Madhubilasam3gama. (Maha1bha1rata, Aran2ya Parva,

<NI>Arva1vasu did penance to the Sun for getting children.
<>The Sun-God came down from his way in the sky and

<HI>ARYAMA1. One of the twelve A1dityas born to Kas4yapa
<>and Aditi. (A1dityas = sons of Aditi). The twelve

<HI>ASAMAN5JASA (ASAMAN5JA). A King of the Solar
<>dynasty born to Sagara. For genealogy see under
<>SAGARA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about his birth in the Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a. Once there was a king called Sagara in Ayodhya1.
<>He married two women named Kes4ini1 and Sumati. For [Page057-b+ 64]
<>a long time they had no sons and so they went to the
<>Hima1layas and started penance there in the mount of
<>Bhr2guprasravan2a. After a hundred years Bhr2gumaha-
<>rs2i appeared before them and pleased them thus: “Your
<>elder wife Kes4ini1 will give birth to a son who will
<>continue your dynasty and your second wife will give
<>birth to sixty thousand children”. After a few years
<>Kes4ini1 gave birth to Asaman5jas and Sumati to a big
<>ball of flesh. That ball broke and sixty thousand babes
<>came out from it. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 83).
<NI>2) {%Character of Asaman5jas.%} He was a very cruel man
<>always tormenting people. He used to throw little child-
<>ren into the Sarayu1 river and stand on the banks of the
<>river enjoying the sight of the children dying drowning.
<>People hated him. His father, therefore, drove him out
<>of his palace. To this bad man was born Am3s4uma1n, a
<>King who became the favourite of the people. (Va1l-
<>mi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 38).
<HI>ASAMPREKS2YAKA1RITVA. See under DEVASARMA

<HI>AS4ANI. A holy hermit. While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was going to
<>Hastina1pura this hermit met him on the way. (M.B.,

<HI>ASIKNI I. A river flowing through the Punjab in India.
<>This is called Candrabha1ga1 and also Ci1na1b (Ci1na1).
<>The R2gveda also mentions about this. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>ASIKNI II. A wife of Daks2a. Daks2apraja1pati, son of
<>Brahma1, commenced creation with his own mind. When
<>he found that it was not conducive to the propagation
<>of the species he pondered over the subject once more
<>and decided to effect it by the sexual union of the male
<>and the female. He, therefore, married Asikni daughter
<>of Vi1ran2apraja1pati. There is a version in the seventh
<>Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata that Vi1ran2i1 was born of
<>the left thumb of Brahma1.
<F>*) It was Maha1vis2n2u who gave Daks2a his wife, Asikni, when Daks2a was doing penance in Vindhya. (S2as2t2a Skandha, Bha1gavata).</F> Then the virile Daks2a-
<>praja1pati begot by Asikni five thousand Haryas4vas with
<>a view to propagating his species and the Haryas4vas
<>also evinced great desire to increase their number.
<>Knowing this devars2i Na1rada of enchanting words
<>approached them and said “Oh, Haryas4vas, I under-
<>stand you, energetic young men, are going to continue
<>creation. Phew! You are children who have not cared
<>to understand the ins and outs or ups and downs of this
<>earth and then how do you think you can create
<>people? You are all endowed with the power to move
<>about on all sides without any obstruction and you are
<>only fools if you do not attempt so find out the limits
<>of this earth”. Hearing this they started on a tour to
<>different sides of the earth to find out its boundaries.
<>Just like worms fallen into the ocean the Haryas4vas have
<>never returned so far.
<NI>When he found that the Haryas4vas were lost the mighty
<>Daks2a begot in the daughter of Vi1ran2i1 a thousand sons
<>called S4abala1s4vas. They were also desirous of propaga-
<>tion but were also persuaded by the words of Na1rada to
<>follow the footsteps of their elder brothers. They dis-
<>cussed it among themselves and said “The words of the
<>Mahars2i are right. We must also follow the course taken
<>by our brothers. It is wise to commence creation after [Page058-a+ 63]
<>knowing the size of the earth.” They also went to
<>different sides and never returned just like rivers falling
<>into the ocean. The loss of the S4abala1s4vas infuriated
<>Daks2a and he cursed Na1rada.
<NI>Again to commence creation Daks2a got of Asikni sixty
<>girls. Of these ten he gave to Dharmadeva, thirteen
<>to Kas4yapa, twentyseven to Soma and four to Aris2t2a-
<>nemi. Two were given to Bahuputra, two to An3giras
<>and two to the scholar Kr2s4a1s4va. Dharmadeva's wives
<>were Arundhati1, Vasu, Yami1, Lamba1, Bha1nu, Marut-
<>vati1, San3kalpa1, Muhu1rta1, Sa1dhya1 and Vis4va1. Of Vis4va1
<>were born Vis4vedevas. Sa1dhya delivered the Sa1dhyas,
<>Marut2va, the Marutvans and Vasu, Vasus. Bha1nus were
<>born of Bha1nu. From Muhu1rta came Muhu1rta1bhima1nis
<>and from Lamba1, Ghos2a and from Yami1, Na1gavi1thi1.

<>to this hell. (Chapter 6, Anus4a1sana Parva 2, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a). The Devi1 Bha1gavata describes Asipatravana
<>like this: “Those who forsake their own natural duty
<>and go in for that of others are thrown into this hell;
<>they die by the orderlies of Yama, the King of Death.
<>There they will be whipped by a whip made of thorny
<>herbs and as they run about with pain they will be
<>followed and whipped. Crashing against the big stones

<>with his permission went to Vasis2t2ha and got with child.
<>Vasis2t2ha returned to the forest. Even after the lapse of a

<>on a flat square piece of granite) and crushed her stomach
<>with it and she delivered a son. As he was born by using

<HI>AS4OKA III. A King of the family of the famous Asura
<>As4va. This king had been ruling over Kalin3ga. (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 14).
<HI>AS4OKADATTA. Once the Vidya1dhara (a class of
<>semi gods) named As4okavega was going through the sky,
<>when the hermit maids of Ga1lava1s4rama (the hermitage
<>of Ga1lava) were bathing in the Ganges. He hankered
<>after them. So the hermits cursed him and changed
<>him to a man. The name of As4okavega in his human
<>birth was As4okadatta. The story of As4okadatta in
<>the “Katha1saritsa1gara” is as follows:
<NI>Long ago there lived a Brahmin named Govindasva1mi1,
<>near the river Ka1lindi1. He had two sons, As4okadatta
<>and Vijayadatta. They were good men like their father.
<>Once there occurred a great famine in the country.
<>Scarcity prevailed everywhere. Govindasva1mi1 told his
<>wife, “I cannot bear to see the difficulties of our peo-
<>ple. So let us give everything we have for famine relief
<>and then go to Ka1s4i1 and live there.” His good-natured
<>wife agreed to it and giving everything for the relief
<>work, Govindasva1mi1 with his wife and children started
<>for Ka1s4i1. On the way he met a hermit sage who had
<>renounced the world. He had his whole body besmear-
<>ed with ashes. With his tuft of hair and garment made
<>of the barks of trees, he seemed to be S4iva. Govinda-
<>sva1mi1 bowed before him, and asked about the future
<>of his children. The Yogi1 (hermit) said, “the future of
<>your two sons is good. But this Vijayadatta will go away
<>from you. Reunion will become possible by the good-
<>ness of As4okadatta.” Govindasva1mi1 felt glad and sad at
<>the same time. Leaving the hermit they proceeded to
<>Ka1s4i1. They neared Ka1s4i1. There was a temple on the
<>way. They stayed there and conducted worship in the
<>temple and took shelter for the night under a tree out-
<>side the temple. Other travellers also were there. Being
<>tired of walking all went to sleep. Vijayadatta the
<>second son of Govindasva1mi1 caught cold. So he woke
<>up in the night. When he began to shiver, because of
<>cold, he called his father and said, “Father, it appears [Page059-b+ 65]
<>that I have caught cold and I am shivering. I would
<>grow better if I could get some fire. So please get some
<>twigs and make a fire. I don't think, I may complete
<>this night otherwise”. They saw a fire close by. It was
<>in a burial-ground. Govindasva1mi1 took Vijayadatta to
<>that place where a dead body was burning.
<NI>Vijayadatta sat near the fire and warmed himself. In
<>the meanwhile he was talking to his father. He said,
<>“Father, what is that round thing seen in the middle
<>of the fire?” “That is the head of a dead body burn-
<>ing” said his father who was standing close by. He took
<>a burning faggot and hit at the head. The head broke
<>into pieces and some viscous stuff from the head fell
<>into his mouth. There occurred a sudden change in
<>Vijayadatta. He became a fearful giant with huge
<>tusks and hair standing erect on the head. Somehow
<>or other he got a sword also. That giant took the burn-
<>ing head from fire and drank up all the viscous liquid
<>in it. With his tongue which looked like blazing fire he
<>licked the bones. Then he threw away the skull. Then
<>he approached his father with open mouth to swallow
<>him. “You! giant, Don't kill your father, come here!”
<>a voice shouted to him from the burial-ground. Thus
<>Vijaya became a giant and disappeared. “Oh dear!
<>my child! my son! Vijayadatta!”, cried his father
<>and came away from the burial-place, and went to the
<>shelter of the tree and told his wife, son and others
<>everything that had happened. Stricken with grief
<>they all fell on the ground. All those who came to
<>worship in the temple gathered round them and tried
<>to console them. Among them was a merchant named
<>Samudradatta, a native of Ka1s4i1. He consoled Govinda-
<>sva1mi1 and his family and took them to his house in
<>Ka1s4i1. He showed hospitality and gave them a separate
<>place to live in. Noble men are kind to those who are
<>in distress. The great hermit had said that their son
<>would come back in due course. Hoping that such a
<>time would come soon Govindasva1mi1 and his family
<>dragged on their time. At the request of that wealthy
<>merchant they stayed there on. As4okadatta got his
<>education there. When he grew up to a youth, he got
<>physical training. He became such an expert in wrestl-
<>ing and other modes of fighting that nobody on earth
<>could overcome him. During a festival there was a
<>contest in wrestling. A renowned wrestler had come
<>from the south to take part in the contest. In the con-
<>test which took place in the presence of Prata1pamukut2a,
<>the King of Ka1s4i1, the wrestler challenged every wrest-
<>ler in the country and had overthrown each one of
<>them. Having heard from the merchant Samudradatta,
<>the King sent for As4okadatta and put him against the
<>wrestler from the south. A very serious fight began
<>between the two. They grappled each other with firm
<>and resolute grips. The audience was struck with won-
<>der at the variety of the modes of grappling and twist-
<>ing and turning they exhibited. Applause came from
<>everywhere. The fight lasted for a very long time.
<>Finally As4okadatta threw the other to the ground,
<>and got much presents from the King. Gradually he
<>became a favourite of the King, and consequently
<>became wealthy. One day the King went to a temple
<>of S4iva, a little away from the capital to observe fast
<>on the fourteenth night of the Moon and while return-
<>ing he passed by a burial-ground and heard a voice
<>saying, “Oh Lord! The judge had ordered me to be [Page060-a+ 64]
<>hanged, for a charge of murder, merely out of personal
<>grudge and without any proof, and this is the third day
<>since I was put on this scaffold. My life has not yet
<>departed from the body. My tongue is dried of thirst.
<>Have the kindness to give me a little water.”
<NI>“Punished without proof! It will appear only so to him
<>who is punished”. Thinking thus the King asked
<>As4okadatta to give the man some water. “Who will go
<>to a burial-ground in the night? I myself shall take
<>water to him”. Saying so As4okadatta took water and
<>went to the burial-ground and the King went to the
<>palace. The world was in darkness. With here and
<>there a spark of fire and light of fire-flies and lightning
<>mingled with the shouting of ghosts and the roaring of
<>the demons and occasional cries of birds and animals
<>the burial-ground was a dreadful place, where As4oka-
<>datta came and asked, “Who asked the King for
<>water?” He heard a voice saying “Myself” and he
<>went to the place of the voice and saw a man lying on
<>a scaffold. An extremely beautiful woman also was lying
<>under the scaffold crying, and getting ready to jump
<>into the burning fire since she could not bear the
<>separation of her husband on the new moon day. She
<>had plenty of golden ornaments on her body. As4oka-
<>datta asked her, “Madam! who are you, why are you
<>crying here?” She replied, “I, an unfortunate woman,
<>am the wife of the man on the scaffold. My intention
<>is to burn myself along with his body. I am waiting for
<>his life to depart. Because of my sin he is not dying.
<>This is the third day since he is lying like this. He will
<>be asking for water now and then. So I have brought
<>some water. But his face being high I cannot reach it
<>and I am seeing him burning with thirst, and am
<>swallowing the grief.” As4okadatta said, “See! The
<>King has sent this water for him. Now climb on my
<>back and you yourself give him this water.”
<NI>The woman instantly took the water and got on the
<>back of As4okadatta who had stooped down for her to
<>climb on his back. After a while he felt drops of blood
<>falling on his back and looking up he saw her cutting
<>flesh from the body of the man on the scaffold and eat-
<>ing it. He got wild with anger and catching hold of her
<>legs he was about to strike her on the ground, when
<>she shook her legs free and ran away and disappeared.
<>Because she dragged away her legs with force one
<>bangle came off from her leg and was left with
<>As4okadatta. Her behaviour aroused in him at first com-
<>passion, detestation in the middle stage and fear in the
<>final stage, and when she had disappeared from his
<>sight he looked at the bangle she had left behind with
<>astonishment. When he reached home it was dawn.
<>After his morning ablution he went to the palace. “Did
<>you give him water yesternight?” asked the King and
<>he replied “Yes”, and placed the bangle before the King.
<>“Where did you get this from?” the King asked and in
<>reply he said everything that had happened in the
<>night. The King thought that As4okadatta was an extra-
<>ordinary man and calling his queen showed her the
<>ornament and told her everything. She was filled with
<>joy and wonder. She praised As4okadatta a good deal.
<>The King said, “Dear queen! This As4okadatta is a
<>young man of greatness, learning, bravery, truth and of
<>good birth. He is handsome too. If he would become
<>the husband of our daughter what a good thing it will [Page060-b+ 65]
<>be? I have a desire to give him our daughter Madana-
<>lekha1”.
<NI>The queen also said that the thought was pleasing to
<>her. “This youth is the most suitable person to be her
<>husband. Some days ago Madanalekha1 had seen him in
<>Madhu garden and from that day a change is visible in
<>her. All laughing and playing is gone from her, and she
<>spends time in loneliness and thinking. I knew this from
<>her maids. Because of my thought about her I did not
<>sleep last night and only just closed my eyes in the
<>dawn. Then it seemed to me that a divine woman
<>appeared and said to me, “My daughter, Don't give
<>your daughter Madanalekha1 to anybody else. She had
<>been the wife of As4okadatta in previous birth”. I woke
<>up immediately. Believing in the dream I consoled our
<>daughter. I am glad that now you also think so. Let the
<>Jasmine creeper entwine round the Mango tree.”
<NI>When the King heard these things from his queen, with-
<>out wasting more time he gave his daughter Madana-
<>lekha1 in marriage to As4okadatta. They suited each
<>other so much that not only their relatives, but the
<>others also were delighted. Brahma1 is well experienced
<>in joining suitable things together. As they were all
<>getting on well one day the queen said to the King,
<>“My lord! this Bangle being single doesn't shine well.
<>We must have another bangle made in the same shape
<>and design.”
<NI>The King immediately had some goldsmiths brought be-
<>fore him. He showed them the bangle and asked them
<>to make one of the same pattern. They turned it on all
<>sides and looked at it and said, “Please your highness!
<>This is not man-made. It is not possible for us to make
<>one of this kind. Precious stones like these are not
<>available in this earth. So the only possible way is to
<>search for its mate in the place where this was found.
<>On hearing these words the King and the queen were
<>crestfallen. Seeing this As4okadatta said that he would
<>bring the mate of the bangle. Fearing danger the King
<>tried to dissuade him. But As4okadatta was not prepared
<>to change his decision. He took the bangle and went to
<>the burial-ground that night. To get the bangle he had
<>to meet the same woman who had left the bangle. He
<>began to think of a means to find her out. He procured
<>a corpse took it on his shoulder and walked about call-
<>ing out “Do you want flesh?” He heard a voice say
<>“Bring it here”, and he walked in that direction. He
<>saw a beautiful woman who appeared to be the mistress,
<>sitting in the midst of so many servant maids on a tree.
<>He called out “Take the flesh”. She asked “How much
<>will it cost?” As4okadatta said, “There is a bangle with
<>me. If you, will give me another bangle like this you shall
<>have the whole body”. Hearing the words of As4okadatta
<>the beautiful woman laughed and said, “That is my
<>bangle. I have its mate with me also. I am the same wo-
<>man you saw when you came to give water to the man
<>on the scaffold. Now the situation is changed. So you do
<>not recognize me. Tonight is the fourteenth lunar night
<>too. It was good that you thought of coming to night.
<>Otherwise you would not have seen me. Now see; let
<>the flesh be there. If you will consent to do what I say I
<>shall give you the other bangle also.” As4okadatta promis-
<>ed to do what she required. Then she began, “There is a
<>city in the Hima1layas known as Trighan2d2a. There lived a
<>giant in that city. His name was Lambajihva. I bearing
<>the name vidyucchikha1, am his wife. Only one daughter [Page061-a+ 65]
<>was born to me. Then my husband was killed in a fight
<>with his overlord Kapa1lasphot2a, who being kind did not
<>do us any harm; and I live in my house now. My daugh-
<>ter is now a young woman. I was roaming about thinking
<>of a way to find out a man of might and bravery as hus-
<>band for my daughter. Then I saw you going this way
<>with the King. The moment I saw you I knew you to be
<>the man I was searching for and I decided to give you
<>my daughter in marriage. What you heard as the words
<>of the man on the scaffold was a trick played by me. You
<>brought water to the scaffold and nobody needed water
<>then. With the knowledge I have in Sorcery and witch-
<>craft I put you into a little confusion. I gave you that
<>bangle to bring you again to me and it has served
<>the purpose today. Let us go to my house. It is my ear-
<>nest wish that you should be the husband of my daughter.
<>And I shall satisfy your immediate need also.”
<NI>The brave As4okadatta agreed to the request of the
<>giantess. She, with her power, took him to their city
<>through the sky. As4okadatta saw the golden city and
<>wondered if it was the sun taking rest after its tedious
<>journey. There he saw the daughter of the giantess and
<>thought her to be the incarnation of his adventurous
<>spirit. She was beautiful in every part of her body. She
<>was called Vidyutprabha1. He married her and lived with
<>them for a while. Then he said to his mother-in-law
<>“Mother! now give me the bangle. I must go to Ka1s4i1.
<>I have promised the King to get the mate of this bangle.”
<>Vidyucchikha1 gave her son-in-law her bangle and a
<>golden lotus flower which he accepted with great joy. As
<>before he came with the giantess to the burial-ground
<>through the sky. Then she said “I shall be here on every
<>fourteenth lunar night on the root of this tree in the
<>burial-ground. If you want to see me come on that day.”
<>“I shall do so”, so saying As4okadatta came away and
<>went to his parents. They were stricken with grief at the
<>departure and exile of their remaining son. They were
<>overcome by joy at the return of their son. Not waiting
<>long he went to the King, his father-in-law, who embrac-
<>ed him with joy. As4okadatta gave him the two bangles.
<>He presented the golden lotus flower also. The King and
<>the queen were amazed at the daring spirit of As4okadatta
<>who told them in detail everything that had happened to
<>him. The fame of As4okadatta grew higher and higher.
<>The King and the queen thought it a blessing that they
<>got so adventurous a son-in-law. Next day the King got
<>a casket made of silver and placed the golden lotus at the
<>mouth of the casket and placed it on the step of his own
<>temple for everyone to see. The white casket and the
<>red lotus were very charming to look at and they glistened
<>as the fame of the King and of As4okadatta. One day the
<>King looked at it with pleasure and said “If we could
<>get one more lotus like this, we could make another casket
<>and place it on the left side of this”. As soon as he heard it
<>As4okadatta said “If the King orders it shall be brought”.
<>But the King said “Ho’ you need not go anymore
<>on erranda like this. This is not such an urgent need”.
<>After a few days the fourteenth lunar night came. Leav-
<>ing his wife the princess sleeping in the bed he left the
<>palace and reached the burial-ground. He saw his mother-
<>in-law the giantess and went with her to the city of the
<>giant and lived there happily for a while with his wife
<>Vidyutprabha1. When he was about to return he requested
<>Vidyucchikha1 to give him one more golden lotus. She said
<>that there was no more lotus with her and that they grew [Page061-b+ 65]
<>in the lake of the giant King Kapa1lasphot2a. As4okadatta
<>requested her to show him that lake. At first Vidyuc-
<>chikha1 dissuaded him from this attempt. But he was
<>stubborn. So she took him to a place away from the
<>lake and showed it to him. The lake was full of golden
<>lotus flowers. It was a pleasing sight. As4okadatta imme-
<>diately got down into the lake and began to pluck the
<>flowers. The guards came and opposed him. He killed
<>a few of them. The others went to their master and in-
<>formed about the theft. Kapa1lasphot2a with his weapons
<>came shouting and roaring and saw his elder brother
<>As4okadatta. He was overpowered by joy and wonder.
<>Throwing away his weapons, with love and devotion
<>towards his elder brother he bowed before him. “My
<>brother! I am Vijayadatta your younger brother. By
<>the will of God I lived as a giant so long. You might
<>have heard this from father. Because we have met now
<>by good luck I remembered that I was a Brahmin. My
<>giantness is gone. On that day something obscured my
<>mind. That is why I became a giant”. When he heard
<>the words of his younger brother As4okadatta embraced
<>him. Both shed tears of joy. At that time Prajn5apti
<>Kaus4ika the teacher of the Vidya1dharas came to them
<>and said, “You are Vidya1dharas. All this happened due
<>to a curse. Now you and your people are liberated from
<>the curse. So learn the duties and functions of your
<>class and with your people take your proper place in
<>the society.” Having taught them everything they re-
<>quired he disappeared. Thus the Vidya1dhara brothers,
<>having plucked golden lotus reached the peak of the
<>Hima1layas through the sky. As4okadatta went to Vidyut-
<>prabha1 who also having been liberated from curse be-
<>came a Vidya1dhara girl. With that beautiful girl the
<>two brothers continued their journey and reached Ka1s4i1
<>where they bowed before their parents. That reunion
<>appeared to be a dream or something nearing madness
<>to their parents. They could not believe their eyes.
<>As4okadatta and Vijayadatta each saying his name bowed
<>before them. Their parents lifted them up and embraced
<>them and kissed them on the head, and cried for joy.
<>They did not know what to do or what to say. Their
<>minds were incapable of thinking. Everybody heard
<>this and was amazed at it. The King was also filled
<>with joy. He came there and took them to the palace.
<>As4okadatta gave all the lotus flowers to the King, who
<>was happy and joyful at the achievement of more than
<>he had hoped for. Everybody appreciated them.
<>Govindasva1mi1, in the presence of the King asked
<>Vijayadatta to tell his story from the moment he turned
<>a giant in the burial-place; “We are very curious to
<>hear it” he said. Vijayadatta began to say “Father,
<>you have seen how because of my mischief, I had brok-
<>en that skull and some viscous liquid fell into my
<>mouth and I changed to a giant. After that the other
<>giants gave me the name Kapa1lasphot2a. They invited
<>me into their midst. We lived together. After a few
<>days they took me to the presence of the King of the
<>giants. As soon as he saw me he was pleased with me
<>and appointed me as the commander-in-chief of the
<>army. He who was overconfident in his power went to
<>war with the Gandharvas and was killed in the fight.
<>From that day onwards all the giants came under my
<>control. Then I met with my brother who came to
<>pluck the golden lotus flowers from my lake. With this
<>all the previous conditions of my life had vanished. [Page062-a+ 63]
<>My brother will say the rest of the story. When Vijaya-
<>datta had finished saying As4okadatta continued the
<>story.
<NI>Long ago when we were Vidya1dharas both of us were
<>going through the sky and we saw the hermit maids
<>of the hermitage of Ga1lava, bathing in the Ganges. We
<>wished to get those girls. The hermits who saw this
<>with their divine eyes cursed that we would take birth
<>as men and in that birth we would be separated in a
<>wonderful way and both of us would unite again in a
<>place where man could not reach and we would
<>be liberated from the curse and learn everything from
<>the teacher, and would become the old Vidya1dharas
<>with our people. And according to this curse we took
<>birth as men and separation was effected. You all have
<>heard it. Today I went to the lake of the King of the
<>giants, with the help of my mother-in-law the giantess
<>for plucking the golden lotus flowers and recovered my
<>brother, this Vijayadatta. There we learned everything
<>from our teacher Prajn5apti Kaus4ika and became
<>Vidya1dharas and have arrived here as fast as we could.”
<>Thus he informed them everything that had occurred.
<>Afterwards by the learning he received from his teacher
<>he changed his parents and the daughter of the King
<>into Vidya1dharas and then bidding adieu to the King
<>As4okadatta, with his two wives, parents and brother
<>went to the emperor of the Vidya1dharas through the
<>sky. When they reached there As4okadatta and Vijaya-
<>datta changed their names into As4okavega and Vijaya-
<>vega. According to the orders of the emperor those
<>Vidya1dhara youths went to the mountain of Govinda-
<>ku1t2a with their people as it was their abode, and
<>lived with happiness and joy. King Prata1pamukut2a
<>with wonder took one of the golden lotus flowers and
<>placed it in the temple and with the rest he made
<>oblations to god and considered his family to have
<>made wonderful achievements. (Katha1saritsa1gara,

<>wife of Yaya1ti. (S4loka 18, Chapter 119, Udyoga Parva,
<>M.B.). See under Ga1lava.
<NI>1) {%How As2t2aka went to heaven.%} This story was told to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas by the sage Ma1rkan2d2eya.
<NI>“As2t2aka, son of Vis4va1mitra, performed an As4vamedha
<>Ya1ga. All the kings took part in this. Pratardana,
<>Vasumanas and Aus4i1nara S4ibi, and all the brothers of
<>As2t2aka attended the function. After the ya1ga As2t2aka
<>took his three brothers for an air travel and on the way
<>met the great sage Na1rada. Na1rada was also taken in
<>and as they continued their flight, As2t2aka asked Na1rada
<>who should step down from the aeroplane if only four
<>were allowed to go to heaven. “As2t2aka”, replied Na1rada
<>and explained the reason also. Once when Na1rada
<>stayed at the a1s4rama of As2t2aka the former found many
<>varieties of cows there and asked As2t2aka whose they
<>were. Then in self praise As2t2aka had said that all
<>those were cows which he had given away as gifts.
<>As2t2aka then asked who should get down if only three
<>were allowed to go to heaven. ‘Pratardana’, said
<>Na1rada and explained the reason. Once when
<>Pratardana was taking Na1rada in the former's chariot
<>four brahmins one behind the other approached him
<>and begged for a horse each. When Pratardana asked
<>for some time the brahmins were not prepared to wait
<>and so he gave all but one of his four horses and asked
<>the fourth to wait. As he was also found to be persistent
<>he gave the one drawing his chariot also and dragged the
<>chariot himself but abusing the brahmins all the way. It
<>was that abuse that gave him the slur. Then As2t2aka asked [Page063-b+ 65]
<>Na1rada who should get down if only two were permitted to
<>enter heaven. ‘Vasumanas’, said Na1rada and explained
<>the reason. Na1rada went to the house of Vasumanas
<>three times and each time the latter spoke highly of his
<>chariot. Na1rada also joined in praising his flower-cha-
<>riot and the brahmins present there also followed suit.
<>Pleased at this Vasumanas became proud of his possession
<>and his vainglorious talks made him unfit. Then As2t2aka
<>asked if only one were allowed to go to heaven who
<>should go. ‘S4ibi’, said Na1rada immediately. Even Na1rada
<>would be only next to S4ibi and Na1rada explained the
<>reason thus. Once a brahmin went to S4ibi for food. S4ibi
<>asked him what food he relished most and the brahmin
<>said that he would like to have the fresh flesh of S4ibi's
<>only son, Br2hadgarbha. Without even the slightest hesi-
<>tation S4ibi killed his son and cooked his flesh and when
<>the food was ready he went out to invite the brahmin.
<>But on going out the King saw the brahmin setting
<>fire to his palace, treasury, armoury, stables, harem and
<>elephant-sheds. Without even a quiver on his face, the
<>king respectfully took the brahmin inside and gave him
<>food. The brahmin was amazed at the patience of the
<>King and sitting before his food for some time told the
<>King that he would be satisfied if the King himself ate
<>that food. Respecting the request the King was about to
<>eat the flesh of his own son when the brahmin who was
<>none other than Brahma1 in disguise praised him for
<>his devotion and gave him back his son adorned with
<>sweet smelling flowers and disappeared blessing them.
<>When his ministers questioned him about this S4ibi said,
<>“I do not give for a name or fame. Neither do I give
<>for wealth and happiness. I do it because it is the only
<>way to be rid of sins”. (Chapter 168, Aran2ya Parva,
<>M.B.).

<HI>AS2T2A1VAKRA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The sage Udda1laka had a disciple named
<>Khagodara (Kahodara) and a daughter named Suja1t2a1.
<>Appreciating the devotion and good conduct of his
<>disciple, Udda1laka gave his daughter Suja1ta1 in marri-
<>age to him. Suja1ta1 became pregnant. When once
<>Khagodara was reciting from the Vedas the babe in the
<>womb of Suja1ta1 said, “I have learnt the mantra you
<>are chanting but the way you chant it is wrong”. (The
<>vibrations of sound created by the utterance of each
<>word is important). Khagodara was angry and he curs-
<>ed his babe in the womb thus “Since your mind seems
<>to be crooked let your body also be of that type, with [Page065-a+ 65]
<>curves all over”. When Suja1ta1 delivered the child it
<>had eight bends and light curves and so the boy was
<>named As2t2a1vakra, meaning one with eight bends.
<>(Chapter 132, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>2) {%Father died before he was born.%} When Suja1ta1 was preg-
<>nant they suffered much from poverty and at the in-
<>sistence of Suja1ta1, Khagodara went to the King Janaka,
<>to beg for some money. Janaka was performing a ya1ga
<>then and so Khagodara had to wait. When at last he
<>went to the royal assembly he was asked to enter into
<>a polemical contest with Va1ndi1na, the court scholar and
<>having been defeated by him was asked to drown him-
<>self.
<NI>Udda1laka got a son named S4vetaketu and Suja1ta1 deli-
<>vered As2t2a1vakra. Both the boys grew in the a1s4rama
<>on great intimacy and Suja1ta1 withheld the news of the
<>death of her husband from the boys. (Chapter 132,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%How Khagodara was got back.%} One day the two boys
<>went to bathe in the river and during a controversial
<>talk S4vetaketu said that As2t2a1vakra had no father. This
<>teased him much and As2t2a1vakra went to his mother
<>and gathered all the facts about his father. He went,
<>then, straight to the royal assembly of King Janaka.
<>He was not allowed inside. The gate keeper said that he
<>was only a boy and only learned men could go inside
<>the sacrificial hall. As2t2a1vakra contended that neither
<>size nor age was any indication of one's knowledge or
<>worth and got himself admitted into the hall. There
<>he entered into a polemical contest with the same court
<>scholar, Va1ndi1na, who had killed his father. Va1ndi1na
<>was defeated and was thrown into the same river in
<>which his father had drowned himself. The moment
<>Va1ndi1na fell into the river Khagodara rose up
<>from there and the father and son along with S4veta-
<>ketu returned to the a1s4rama. Khagodara then took his
<>son for a bath and when it was over As2t2a1vakra became
<>a bright boy without crooks. (Chapter 133, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.)
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} As2t2a1vakra wanted to marry Suprabha1, the
<>daughter of a sage named Vada1nya. When Vada1nya was
<>approached for this the Sage decided to test the love
<>which As2t2a1vakra had towards his daughter and said: “I
<>am going to test you. You go to the north to the Hima1-
<>layas. Pay homage to S4iva and Pa1rvati1 and go further
<>north. There you will find a very beautiful damsel. You
<>talk to her and return and when you come back I shall
<>give you my daughter.”
<NI>Accepting this challenge As2t2a1vakra went north. When
<>he went to the Hima1layas Kubera entertained him. He
<>remained there for a year enjoying the dances of celes-
<>tial maidens and then, after worshipping S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1 went further north. There he came across seven
<>very attractive women. At the command of As2t2a1vakra
<>the eldest of the lot, Uttara1, remained with him; all the
<>rest left the place immediately she started making love
<>with him and requested him to marry her. But As2t2a1-
<>vakra did not yield and told her about his promise to
<>Vada1nya. Pleased at this reply Uttara1 revealed that she
<>was the queen of the north in disguise and was testing
<>him. She then blessed As2t2a1vakra who fulfilling his
<>mission successfully, returned and married the girl he
<>wanted. (Chapter 19, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Another version of how the body became crooked.%} There
<>is another story also about As2t2a1vakra. Once there lived [Page065-b+ 65]
<>a sage named Asita. He did great penance to please S4iva
<>to bless him with a child. S4iva blessed him and he got a
<>son named Devala. Rambha1, the queen of devaloka, fell
<>in love with him but Devala did not yield to her wishes.
<>Then Rambha1 cursed him and made him into one with
<>eight crooks. Thus Devala came to be called As2t2a1vakra.
<>He then did penance for six thousand years and Bhaga-
<>va1n Kr2s2n2a accompanied by Ra1dha1 appeared before him.
<>Ra1dha1 was shocked by the ugliness of the sage and did
<>not relish his sight. But Kr2s2n2a asking her to remain
<>quiet went and embraced him. At once As2t2a1vakra lost
<>all his crooks and became a beautiful man. At that time
<>a chariot descended from heaven and all of them went
<>to heaven in it. (Brahmavaivartta Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%Other information.%} (1) As2t2a1vakra was also present
<>among the r2s2is who partook in the coronation ceremony
<>conducted after Ra1ma's return to Ayodhya1 from Lan3ka1.
<>(Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(2) As2t2a1vakra cursed those. celestial maidens who re-
<>buked him for his ugliness and they were born on earth
<>as the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. When after the death of
<>Kr2s2n2a they were being taken by Arjuna to the north they
<>were forcibly taken by some of the shepherds. (Chapter
<>15, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>AS2T2A1VAKRATI1RTHA. If one observes complete fasting
<>for twelve days doing tarpan2a in this sacred pond it is
<>said that he gets the benefit of doing of Naramedha-
<>yajn5a. (S4loka 41, Chapter 25, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS2T2A1VAKTRA. See under As2t2a1vakra.

<>Ji1vaka, It2avaka, R2ddhi, Vr2ddhi (These are used in infu-
<>sions for treating rheumatism).
<HI>AS2T2AVASU(S).
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Gan2adevata1s are called As2t2avasus. They
<>were born to Dharmadeva of his wife Vasu, daughter of
<>Daks2a. They are: Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Ahar, Anila,
<>Anala, Pratyu1s2a and Prabha1sa. (S4lokas 17 and 18,
<>Chapter 66, A1di Parva, M.B.). There is a version in
<>certain pura1n2as that the As2t2avasus are the sons of
<>Kas4yapa.
<NI>Different pura1n2as give different names to these As2t2a-
<>vasus. According to Vis2n2u Pura1n2a they are: A1pa,
<>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Anala, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. (Chapter 15 of Am3s4am 1). In Bha1gavata
<>they are Dron2a, Pra1n2a, Dhruva, Arka, Agni, Dos2a,
<NI>Vasu and Vibha1vasu. In Harivam3s4a they are: Akha,
<>Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Anila, Anala, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. This only indicates that some of these have
<>two or more names for them.
<NI>2) {%Curse of Vasis2t2ha.%} Once the As2t2avasus were enjoy-
<>ing a picnic with their wives and they happened to go
<>to the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha. One of the wives got ena-
<>moured over Nandini1, Vasis2t2ha's beautiful cow and
<>wanted it. The Vasu to please his wife took the cow by
<>force and left the place. When the sage found his cow
<>missing after some time he understood by his divine
<>powers who stole the cow and so he cursed the As2t2a-
<>vasus saying that all of them would be born on earth as
<>men. The As2t2avasus were greatly worried and approach-
<>ed the sage apologising and craving for pardon. The sage
<>relaxed the curse and declared that their life on earth
<>would be only for a very short time maintaining that
<>the particular Vasu who committed the theft would live
<>for a long time as man. It was this Vasu, A1pa (Dyau)
<>who was born as Bhi1s2ma. [Page066-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Rebirth of As2t2avasus.%} The As2t2a vasus were pondering
<>over the curse and were thinking of how to bear it
<>without hardship when Gan3ga1devi1 appeared before them
<>and they then appealed to her: “Devi1, if you become
<>the queen on earth of some noble King we shall be born
<>as your sons and you must throw us into the river as
<>soon as we are born”. Gan3ga1devi1 accepted their request.
<>Once there was a King called Prati1pa in the Candra
<>dynasty. One day when this ascetic King was worship-
<>ping Su1rya on the banks of the river Gan3ga1 a beautiful
<>damsel arose from the waters and sat on the right
<>thigh of the King. Surprised the King told her thus, “Oh
<>beautiful maiden, who are you? Do you realise what
<>unrighteous thing you have done? I am not one who
<>goes after women and it was a bit daring of you to
<>have taken me as a beau. Please understand that the
<>right thigh is intended for a daughter and daughter-in-
<>law. You can claim this right when you become the
<>wife of my son.” The beautiful girl was none other than
<>Gan3ga1devi1 herself and she disappeared soon on receiving
<>the rebuke.
<NI>Prati1pa got a son named S4antanu and Gan3ga1devi1 be-
<>came the wife of S4antanu. (For more details about this
<>see under Gan3ga1). When Gan3ga1devi1 became the wife of
<>S4antanu she made a condition to be his queen.
<>“Whether good or bad you should not obstruct any
<>action of mine. You must never give me any opinion of
<>yours on any matter. You must obey what I order. If at
<>any time you break any of these promises I will leave
<>you that instant.”
<NI>It was while Gan3ga1devi1 was living on earth as the wife
<>of S4antanu that the As2t2avasus were born to her. One
<>after the other she threw into the river seven sons but
<>when she was about to throw the eighth the King
<>objected to it and Gan3ga1 disappeared immediately. That
<>son was Bhi1s2ma, who was none other than Dyau born
<>on earth by the curse of Vasis2t2ha. All the others, released
<>from the curse, went to heaven. (More details under
<>Bhi1s2ma).
<NI>4) {%A missile to Bhi1s2ma.%} When Bhi1s2ma had to fight against
<>his guru, Paras4ura1ma, the As2t2avasus gave him the
<>missile, Prasva1pa1. (See Amba1) (S4lokas 11 to 13, Chapter
<>183, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Sons of As2t2avasus.%} The sons of A1pa, the first of the
<>Vasus, are: Vaitan2d2ha, S4rama, S4a1nta and Dhvani. Ka1la,
<>the destroyer of all, is the son of Dhruva. Varcas is the
<>son of Soma. Dharma got of his wife Manohari1 five sons
<>Dravin2a, Hutahavyava1ha, S4is4ira, Pra1n2a and Varun2a.
<>S4iva1 was Anila's wife and she got two sons, Manojava
<>and Avijn5a1tagati. Agni's son Kuma1ra was born at
<>S4arastamba. Kuma1ra got three brothers, S4a1kha, Vis4a1kha
<>and Naigameya. Kuma1ra is known as Ka1rttikeya
<>because he was born of Kr2ttikas. The sage, Devala is
<>the son of Pratyu1s2a. Devala got two sons of great intelli-
<>gence and forbearance. Varastri1, sister of Br2haspati and
<>a woman of great yogic powers and world-wide travels
<>became the wife of Prabha1sa. She gave birth to the
<>famous Vis4vakarmapraja1pati. He was the inventor of a
<>great many handicrafts and ornaments He became the
<>consulting architect of the devas and ranked first in that
<>art. The aeroplanes of the devas were designed by him.
<>Men on earth depend on his art even now. That archi-
<>tect had four sons: Ajaikapa1t, Ahirbudhnya, Tvas2t2a1
<>and Rudra, the bold. The great ascetics, Vis4varu1pa,
<>Hara, Bahuru1pa, Tryambaka, Apara1jita, Vr2s2a1kapi, [Page066-b+ 64]
<>S4ambhu, Kapardi, Raivata, Mr2gavya1dha, S4arva and
<>Kapa1li were the sons of Tvas2t2a1. These are known as the
<>twelve Rudras. Pura1n2as say that there are a hundred
<>Rudras like this. (Chapter 15, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).

<>horse. If you do a hundred such ya1gas you can become
<>Indra.
<F>*) As4vamedha or horse sacrifice was performed by autocrats to establish their supreme sovereignty. For this the horse let out to roam
<>about should go into all countries. Those who opposed the sovereignty of the King could stop the horse and tie it. Then the King had

<>in a box the infant Karn2a. At night accompanied by
<>her maid, Kunti floated the box containing her illegiti-
<>mate son and stood on the banks of As4vanadi1 weeping
<>bitterly. Then thinking that her father would notice
<>her absence from the palace she returned home soon.
<>The box floated and reached the country, Campa1puri1,
<>ruled by a charioteer. (S4lokas 22 to 26, Chapter 308,
<>Aran2ya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VARATHA1. A river in the Gandhama1dana valley
<>flowing near the A1s4rama of the sage A1rs2t2is2en2a. Many

<HI>AS4VASENA. A serpent which lived in the forest of
<>Kha1n2d2ava. This was the son of Taks2aka and he tried
<>his best to escape from the fire that burnt the forest.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 239, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>Once when Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a were sitting on the banks
<>of the river Yamuna1, Agni approached them and request-
<>ed them to help him burn the forest of Kha1n2d2ava (see
<>under Kha1n2d2avada1ha). They agreed to help him and
<>Agni started burning the forest. Indra poured rains over
<>the fire; Arjuna created a canopy of arrows and prevent-
<>ed the rains from falling down. As4vasena, son of
<>Taks2aka tried to escape from the fire but Arjuna obs-
<>tructed his way by arrows. Then As4vasena's mother
<>swallowed him and kept him in her stomach. Arjuna
<>cut off her head. Seeing this Indra sent a cyclone to
<>smash the canopy of arrows and Arjuna fell fainting.
<>Taking the opportunity As4vasena escaped. When Arjuna
<>woke up from his unconscious state he found As4vasena
<>missing. Then Arjuna cursed him thus: “Let not you
<>get refuge anywhere.” (Chapter 226, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>As4vasena kept his grudge against Arjuna till the end.
<>In the great battle Arjuna and Karn2a met for a fight
<>and when Karn2a sent his Na1ga1stra (serpent missile)
<>against Arjuna, As4vasena hid himself in that missile
<>and burnt the beautiful headwear of Arjuna. But Karn2a
<>did not like this foul play and refused to accept him
<>when he came back. Enraged at this the serpent attacked
<>Arjuna directly and was killed. Before his death he got
<>acquainted with Kr2s2n2a. (Chapter 96, Karn2a Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AS4VAS4IRAS I. A son born to Kas4yapa of Danu1. (S4loka

<>the Vedas at Vaiha1yasakun2d2a near Narana1ra1yan2a1s4rama.
<>(S4loka 3, Chapter 127, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VAS4IRASTHA1NA(M). A sacred place in ancient
<>India. Arjuna dreams of going to S4iva with Kr2s2n2a and
<>in that dream they visit this place also. (Chapter 80,
<>Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VA1TAKA. A country of ancient India. (S4loka 15,
<>Chapter 51, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VATARA. A serpent. A sacred pond built in Praya1ga
<>also carries this name. (S4loka 76, Chapter 55, Vana
<>Parva and S4loka 10, Chapter 35, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VATI1RTHA. An ancient holy place on the banks of
<>the river, Ganges, near Kanauj. It was at this place
<>that the horses rose from the earth at the request of
<>R2ci1ka R2s2i to Varun2a (See under As4vakr2ta). (S4loka
<>17, Chapter 4, M.B.)
<HI>AS4VATTHA1MA1.
<NI>1) {%Birth and genealogy.%} The semen of Bharadva1ja R2s2i
<>fell into the hollow of a bamboo and from there was
<>born Dron2a. As per the instructions of his father Dron2a
<>married Kr2pi1, daughter of the sage, S4a1radvata. The
<>good-natured Kr2pi1 gave birth to As4vattha1ma1. (See
<>under Dron2a for genealogy). (Chapter 130, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.)
<NI>2) {%How he got his name.%} The moment he was born he
<>made a loud hoot like Uccais4ravas and the sound resem-
<>bled the braying of a horse. Immediately a voice from
<>heaven said that the boy should be named As4vattha1ma1. [Page068-b+ 65]
<>The boy was, therefore, named so. (S4lokas 48 and 49,
<>Chapter 130, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Training in archery.%} As4vattha1ma1 took his lesson in
<>archery from his father Dron2a. At that time Dron2a got
<>new lessons from Paras4ura1ma and they were also im-
<>parted to Dron2a's disciples. When Dron2a became the
<>preceptor of the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas As4vattha1ma1
<>also went with him. (S4lokas 52 to 64, Chapter 130, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Dron2a's affection for his son.%} Dron2a was very affec-
<>tionate to his son and wanted to teach him something
<>special in archery. So he used to instruct him during
<>the time the other disciples went to fetch water for the
<>a1s4rama. Arjuna came to know of this and he, there-
<>after, started bringing his quota of water quickly
<>enough to join the special class of Dron2a. Thus Arjuna
<>and As4vattha1ma1 learned a lot more than the others in
<>the military art. (S4lokas 17-19, Chapter 132, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%The Maha1bha1rata Battle and As4vattha1ma1.%} In Sabha1
<>Parva we find As4vattha1ma1 participating in the Ra1ja-
<>su1ya of Yudhis2t2hira. After that we meet him only at
<>the Kuruks2etra war. Fighting on the side of the Kau-
<>ravas he played a very important role in that war. He
<>killed many veteran warriors and kings including the
<>following: Ni1la, An5janaparva1, Suratha, S4atrun5jaya,
<>Bala1ni1ka, Jaya1ni1ka, Jaya1s4va, Sruta1s4va, Hemama1li1, Vr2s2a-
<>dhara, Candrasena, the ten sons of Kuntibhoja, Sudar-
<>s4ana, Vr2ddhaks2etra, Cedira1ja, Malayadhvaja and Sura-
<>tha. He defeated many including S4ikhan2d2i1, Abhimanyu,
<>Vira1t2a, Sa1tyaki and Vindhya. By using A1gneya1stra
<>(the arrow of fire) he made Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna fall
<>fainting in the battle-field. He commanded the Kaurava
<>army once. He killed many Pa1n5ca1las and Somakas
<>while they were sleeping. In Chapter 139 of Dron2a
<>Parva we read about Arjuna defeating As4vattha1ma1 in
<>a single combat one day.
<NI>6) {%As4vattha1ma1 sees a ghost.%} Dhr2s2t2adyumna, son of King
<>Pa1n5ca1la, killed Dron2a. When As4vattha1ma1 heard of
<>his father's death his rage knew no bound. He imme-
<>diately went to the heart of the military camp of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas, Kr2pa and Sa1tvata following him. There at the
<>gate of the camp he beheld a ghostly apparition. It is
<>described in the Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata (Malaya1lam version of
<>M.B.) as follows: He saw a huge figure standing at the
<>door with a body blazing like the Sun and the Moon.
<>Bathed in blood and wearing a tiger's skin in the loins
<>the figure wore a snake as his sacred thread and cover-
<>ed his upper body with a deer-skin. There were innu-
<>merable hands for this ghost and in each hand adorned
<>with snake-bangles he held a deadly weapon. With
<>crooked teeth and a ghastly face the goblin gave a
<>shiver to those who saw him. Flames bursting forth
<>from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth he barred the way
<>of As4vattha1ma1. Undaunted the son of Dron2a showered
<>divine arrows on the figure. But the ghost by his sup-
<>reme powers absorbed the arrows to his body the
<>moment they touched him. In despair As4vattha1ma1
<>meditated on S4iva and the latter appearing before him
<>in person gave him a divine dagger. With that he entered
<>the bed-chamber of Dhr2s2t2adyumna, woke him up by
<>striking him with his foot, caught hold of him by the
<>hair on his head and killed him.
<NI>7) {%As4vattha1ma1 and his jewel.%} The anger of As4yattha1ma1 did
<>not abate even after killing Dhr2s2t2adyumna, the butcher [Page069-a+ 65]
<>of his father. With a view to destroying the whole Pa1n2d2-
<>ava dynasty he sent against the Pa1n2d2avas the all-power-
<>ful Brahmas4ira1stra (a missile charged with great power
<>by a holy incantation). But Dron2a had given the same
<>type of missile to Arjuna also and so he sent forth his to
<>meet the other. It created such a great explosion that
<>all the elders on both the sides joined together and re-
<>quested them to withdraw the missiles. Arjuna demanded
<>the jewel on As4vattha1ma1's head to withdraw his missile.
<>But As4vattha1ma1 refused to part with it. He said, “This
<>jewel of mine is more valuable than all the wealth of both
<>Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas put together. If you wear this
<>you need not be afraid of your enemies, disease, hunger
<>and thirst. No harm will come to you from Yaks2as,
<>Na1gas or thieves. I will never part with such a jewel”.
<>(S4lokas 28-30, M.B., Chapter 15, Sautika Parva). After
<>great persuasion As4vattha1ma1 surrendered his jewel but
<>without withdrawing the missile directed it towards the
<>womb of Uttara1 who was bearing a child then. We
<>are reminded of an incident which happened when
<>the Pa1n2d2avas were residing in Upapla1vya; a poor
<>brahmin looking at Uttara1 said, “When the Kauravas
<>will be weakening in power a child will be born to you.
<>The boy will have to bear a test even while in the
<>womb and so you must name the child Pari1ks2it (One
<>who has been tested)”.
<NI>When the powerful missile was flying straight towards
<>Uttara1's womb S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a said, “Even though the child
<>in the womb will die of this arrow it will be reborn.
<>Oh, As4vattha1ma1, you will be denounced by all as a
<>sinner for killing this unborn babe. To suffer for this
<>evil deed you will roam about in the earth for three
<>thousand years. Nobody will associate with you; you will
<>be shunned by society. You will be tormented by all
<>diseases on earth. But the babe which you have now
<>killed will be a famous scholar and brave King. He will
<>rule this country for sixty years. He will be known
<>as the next Kurura1ja. Look, I am giving life to the babe
<>you have killed”. Vya1sa supported Kr2s2n2a, and As4vat-
<>tha1ma1 repenting on his hasty action gave the jewel to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas and left for the forest with Vya1sa.
<>(Sautika Parva, M.B.).

<>As4viani1kuma1ras. (S4lokas 17 and 18, Chapter 150, Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, M.B.). They are also known as As4vins, [Page069-b+ 65]
<>and As4vini1devas. These two are the physicians

<>Brahma1, Mari1ci, Kas4yapa, Vivasva1n (the Sun),
<>As4vini1kuma1ras.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a describes the birth thus:
<>“Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1, was the wife of
<>Su1rya. She got three children: Manu, Yama and Yami1.
<>Once finding the effulgence of Su1rya unbearable she
<>engaged Cha1ya1 to look after Su1rya and left for the
<>forests to do penance there. Su1rya took Cha1ya1 to be
<>Sam3jn5a1 and got three children of her: S4anais4cara,
<>(another) Manu and Tapati1. Once Cha1ya1 got angry
<>and cursed Yama. It was then that Su1rya and Yama
<>came to know that she was not Sam3jn5a1, getting more
<>details from Cha1ya1, Su1rya found out by his Jn5a1nadr2s2t2i
<>(a power of sight developed by Yoga by which one
<>could see things far beyond the limits of his vision)
<>that Sam3jn5a1 was practising austerities taking the form of
<>a mare. Then Su1rya went to her disguised as a horse
<>and with her co-operation produced three children of
<>which the first two became known as As4vini1kuma1ras. The
<>third son was called Revanta. Then Su1rya took Sam3jn5a1
<>to his place (Chapter 2, Am3s4a 3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<>S4loka 35 of Chapter 66 of A1di Parva states that As4vini1-
<>kuma1ras were born from the nose of Sam3jn5a1.
<NI>3) {%How As4vini1kuma1ras tested Sukanya1.%} The Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata contains a story of how the As4vini1kuma1ras tested
<>the fidelity of Sukanya1, daughter of S4arya1ti and made
<>her old and senile husband into a young and virile one.
<>S4arya1ti, son of Vaivasvata manu, had four thousand
<>beautiful princesses as wives. But none had any child-
<>ren. When they were lamenting over this misfortune
<>one of the wives gave birth to a girl and she was called
<>Sukanya1. The father and all his wives together brought
<>up this daughter with great affection.
<NI>In the neighbourhood of the palace of S4arya1ti there was
<>a tapovana as good and grand as Nandanavana and it
<>contained a lake similar to the Ma1nasa lake. In one
<>corner of this tapovana a sage named Cyavana was
<>doing penance. He had been sitting there for so long a
<>period without food meditating on a goddess that he was
<>covered with plants and shrubs had grown over him. He
<>was unaware of the growth around him. Once at this
<>time S4arya1ti with his wives and child and followed by a
<>large retinue entered the tapovana for recreation. The
<>King and his wives entered the lake and Sukanya1 with
<>her friends moved about in the garden plucking flowers
<>and playing. Moving about thus aimlessly Sukanya1 and
<>party reached the place where Cyavana was doing
<>penance. She saw the huge shrubby growth and while
<>looking at it saw two gleaming points inside the shrubby
<>heap. She was about to break open the thing when from
<>inside she heard somebody addressing her thus: “Oh,
<>innocent girl, why do you think of doing this mischief.
<>Please do go your way. I am an ascetic. What wrong
<>have I done to you for you to disturb me like this?” But
<>Sukanya1 brought up as she was, as a very pet girl did
<>not like anybody advising her like this and so taking a
<>pointed stick gave two pricks at the site of the gleam-
<>points and left the place arrogantly.
<NI>The gleam-points were the eyes of Cyavana and so he
<>lost his eyes and suffered much from the pain. Though
<>he felt angry he did not curse anybody. But slowly the [Page070-a+ 65]
<>country began to witness the evil effects of this cruel
<>deed. People stopped passing urine or faeces. Even
<>animals were affected. The King and his ministers were
<>worried. People came on deputation to the King to
<>describe the disaster that had gripped the state. The
<>King began to doubt that somebody must have done some
<>great injury to the sage, Cyavana. He started enquiries
<>asking his subjects one by one about this. But everybody
<>replied in the negative. He bribed, he threatened. The
<>result was the same. Then one day while the King and
<>his courtiers were sitting despondent Sukanya1 approach-
<>ed her father and confessed what she had done. She
<>said: “While I was playing with my friends in the
<>tapovana I saw this huge shrub-heap and two points
<>gleaming from inside. I took a pin-stick and pricked
<>them both and on drawing it out I found it wet also.
<>But I left the matter there and never made any
<>enquiries thereafter”. S4arya1ti now knew the cause of this
<>national disaster and so immediately rushed to the sage
<>for forgiveness. Prostrating before the r2s2i the King pleaded
<>“Oh, best of r2s2is, forgive us for this injury done unknow-
<>ingly. My daughter who is only an innocent child did
<>this playfully while she was playing in this garden with
<>her friends. She never knew what she pricked for a fun
<>were your eyes. Oh, the best of sage, thou art rich in
<>forgiveness and so please do condone this mischief and
<>bless us.” Cyavana replied that he would forgive if he
<>gave Sukanya1 in marriage to him. S4arya1ti was depressed.
<>How could he give his only and beautiful daughter to
<>this aged senile ugly and blind r2s2i? While the King was
<>thus pondering over this, Sukanya1 herself came to him
<>and said, “Oh, dear father, please do not worry on
<>my account. I shall go as his wife. If he is satisfied
<>the nation would be saved from a calamity and I am
<>prepared to sacrifice my happiness for the sake of the
<>country. I will be only too glad to do so.” With suppress-
<>ed unwillingness the King gave his daughter in marri-
<>age to Cyavana.
<NI>Sukanya1 after her marriage engaged herself fully in the
<>service of looking after the welfare of her husband. She
<>gave her husband healthy and tasty fruits and vegeta-
<>bles, bathed him daily in hot water, placed before him
<>all the materials for his pu1ja1 and when the time came
<>for his meals gave him his food sitting by his side. After
<>the meals she gave him ta1mbu1la and only after putting
<>him on a bed would she go to attend to her own affairs.
<>After finishing her meals she would come again to her
<>husband and sit by his side massaging him. In the even-
<>ing she would make ready all the things required for the
<>pu1ja1 and after the pu1ja1 feed him with nourishing food.
<>Whatever remained after his feed would be taken by her.
<>At night she would be at the foot of her husband and
<>take a nap. In the morning she would attend to all the
<>details of the ablutions of her husband. Thus Sukanya1
<>lived true to her husband always anxious to please him.
<>Then one day the As4vini1kuma1ras saw her going to the
<>a1s4rama after her bath. They were very much attracted
<>by the stunning beauty of the maiden that they approach-
<>ed her and asked: “Oh, beautiful maiden, who are you?
<>We are As4vini1kuma1ras. You seem to be alone. How did
<>you happen to come to this place? You are one who
<>should always move about with friends and courtiers
<>and what is the reason for your living like this?”
<>Sukanya1 replied, “Revered Devas, I am the daughter of
<>S4arya1ti and wife of Cyavana. Forced by certain circum- [Page070-b+ 65]
<>stances my father gave me in marriage to this sage who
<>is very old and blind. He is living in the a1s4rama nearby.
<>I am living with him looking after his comfort. If you
<>think it convenient you can come and accept our
<>hospitality.” Hearing this the As4vini1kuma1ras told her
<>thus: “Sweet girl, you are fit to be the wife of one who
<>is better than this blind old ascetic. So please do accept
<>one of us as your husband”. Sukanya1 did not relish
<>this talk and threatening them that if they did not with-
<>draw stopping such blabbering she would curse them
<>to ashes. The As4vini1devas were a bit surprised and also
<>frightened at the attitude of Sukanya1. “Oh, Princess,
<>we are immensely pleased at your sense of righteousness
<>and chastity and you can ask of us a boon. We are
<>physicians of the devas and can give your husband his
<>sight and can also make him young and virile. But there
<>is a condition for this. As soon as your husband be-
<>comes young and handsome we will also become like
<>him and then you can select one among us. Are you
<>willing? If so we will make your husband charming and
<>handsome at this instant.
<NI>Sukanya1 was well pleased with this offer but the condi-
<>tion placed did not satisfy her. So she ran to the a1s4rama
<>and told her husband thus: “Lord, I met the As4vini1-
<>devas on my way from the river after my bath and
<>enamoured of my beauty they have made this offer. We
<>will make your husband young and beautiful giving him
<>back his eyesight and then we will change ourselves to
<>resemble him. You have then to select one of us as your
<>husband. I am not able to understand their cunning and
<>so I have come to you to get from you the answer for
<>their question. I am anxious to see you young and hand-
<>some with your eyesight regained. I shall do as you
<>direct.”
<NI>Cyavana said: “There is nothing in this for great think-
<>ing. You go and tell them that you would do as they
<>wish and bring them down here. On hearing this Sukanya1
<>went to the As4vini1kuma1ras and took them to the a1s4rama.
<>They asked Cyavana to take a dip in the lake nearby
<>and as he entered the lake the As4vini1devas also entered
<>it and took a dip in its waters along with Cyavana. Lo!
<>As they rose from the waters all the three became young
<>and handsome looking alike. The As4vini1devas then
<>requested Sukanya1 to select one among them. Sukanya1
<>was in a fix and she prayed to her goddess to give her
<>power to identify her husband. She was blessed with
<>that power and she selected Cyavana from the lot at
<>which the As4vini1devas were also pleased. (Seventh
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Cyavana's gratitude.%} Cyavana who got back his eye-
<>sight and youth asked the As4vini1kuma1ras what boon
<>they wanted. They then told him thus: “We are the
<>physicians of the devas. Devendra has unnecessarily put
<>a ban on our drinking Soma (juice extracted from the
<>creeper Soma). When Brahma1 performed a ya1ga at
<>Maha1meru this leader of the devas did not allow us to
<>take a soma drink. If you are capable of doing it you
<>should get us the right to take this celestial drink.”
<>Cyavana promised to do that.
<NI>Before long, King S4arya1ti and his wife came to the
<>a1s4rama to enquire about the welfare of their daughter.
<>To their great amazement they found a young and hand-
<>some ascetic at the a1s4rama and were a bit suspicious of
<>the character of their daughter. But soon all doubts were
<>cleared and they were immensely pleased. Cyavana then [Page071-a+ 65]
<>told the King the request of the As4vini1devas and S4arya1ti
<>also promised his help on this matter.
<NI>On their return to their palace S4arya1ti decided to per-
<>form a big ya1ga to which all the devas were also invited.
<>Cyavana officiated as priest. The As4vini1devas were also
<>present quite to the dislike of Indra. The time came for
<>distributing soma, and when Cyavana called the As4vini1-
<>kuma1ras to take their share Indra objected saying that
<>since they were physicians of the devas they could not
<>be given that drink. Cyavana argued against that and
<>after a great verbal combat Cyavana succeeded in
<>making the As4vini1kuma1ras take the drink. For more
<>details look under ‘Cyavana’. (Seventh Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Other information regarding As4vini1kuma1ras.%}
<NI>(1) How they tested Upamanyu. This story is given
<>under the word A1podadhaumya.
<NI>(2) Birth of Nakula and Sahadeva. Kunti1, wife of Pa1n2d2u,
<>had obtained from Sage Durva1sas five sacred mantras,
<>the chanting of each of which would give her a child.
<NI>Even before her marriage Kunti1 tested the power of the
<>mantras by chanting one of them. Su1rya appeared and
<>she had to take a son from him who became the famous
<>Karn2a later. By chanting the second, third and fourth
<>meditating on Yama, Va1yu and Indra, Kunti1 got
<>respectively the sons Dharmaputra, Bhi1ma and Arjuna.
<>The fifth mantra she gave to Ma1dri1 and she meditated
<>on the As4vini1devas and got Nakula and Sahadeva.
<NI>(3) The As4vini1devas were present for the marriage of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. (S4loka 6, Chapter 186, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>During the burning of the forest Kha1n2d2ava the As4vini1-
<>devas stood on the side of Arjuna.
<NI>(4) King Yuvana1s4va became pregnant and bore a child.
<>It was the As4vini1devas who took the child out by surgery.
<>The boy became known as Ma1ndha1ta1 later. (S4loka 3,

<NI>(5) During the Maha1bha1rata battle the As4vini1devas
<>handed over some Pa1rs2adas to the god, Skanda. (S4loka

<NI>(6) The As4vini1devas like very much oblations of Ghee.
<>The others who like it are Br2haspati, Pu1s2an, Bhaga and
<>Pa1vaka. (S4loka 7, Chapter 65, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(7) The month of A1s4vina (October-November) is the
<>month of As4vini1kuma1ras and if a man gives ghee to the
<>Brahmins freely in that month he will acquire more
<>physical beauty. (S4loka 10, Chapter 65, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(8) One who offers Ghee as oblation to the fire for
<>twelve months in succession will reach the country of
<>the As4vini1kuma1ras. (S4loka 95, Chapter 107, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(9) The great poet of Kerala, Vallathol, in his com-
<>mentary on the 93rd Su1kta of the R2gveda states that
<>there is a belief that the As4vins and Candrasu1ryas (the
<>Sun and Moon) are one and the same.
<NI>(10) Di1rghas4ravas son of Di1rghatamas once prayed to
<>the As4vini1devas to get rains and it is said that they gave
<>a downpour of sweet water. (R2gveda, Su1kta 112, R2k 11).
<NI>(11) Once a sage named Gotama was lost in a desert
<>and craved bitterly for drinking water. He prayed to the
<>As4vini1devas for water and they dug a well itself in the
<>desert and quenched the thirst of the sage. (R2k 9, Su1kta
<>16, R2gveda).
<NI>(12) The sage Dadhyan5c taught the As4vini1devas the
<>technique, Madhuvidya1. There is an interesting story [Page071-b+ 65]
<>about it. It was Indra who taught this to Dadhyan5c
<>and while teaching him he had threatened that if he
<>gave away that secret to anybody else his head would
<>be cut off. As4vini1devas found a way to tide over this
<>difficulty. They at first cut off his head and fixed the
<>head of a horse on him. It was with the head of a
<>horse that Dadhyan5c taught them Madhuvidya1 and
<>as soon as the teaching was over his horse-head was
<>cut off and the real head placed in its place. (R2k 22,
<>Su1kta 116, R2gveda).
<NI>(13) The vehicle of the As4vini1devas is a donkey.
<>Once this donkey in the disguise of a wolf went and
<>stayed with R2jra1s4va, son of the Ra1jar2s2i Vr2s2a1gi1r. R2jra1-
<>s4va gave the wolf to eat hundred goats belonging to
<>the people of the place. Vr2s2a1gi1r got angry at this act
<>of his son and cursed him. The son became blind and
<>he got back his eyesight by pleasing the As4vini1devas
<>by prayer and offerings. (R2k 16, Su1kta 115, R2g-
<>veda).
<NI>(14) Once Surya1 decided to give his daughter in
<>marriage to the owner of the horse which would win a
<>horse-race which Surya1 would conduct. In the race the
<>horse of the As4vini1devas won and they thus married
<>Su1rya1's daughter. (R2k 17, Su1kta 117, R2gveda).
<NI>(15) The As4vini1kuma1ras killed an asura of name
<>Vis2vak and destroyed his dynasty also. (R2k 16, Su1kta

<HI>AS4VINI1KUMA1RATI1RTHA. It is believed that the
<>physical beauty of man would be increased if he bath-
<>es in this lake. (S4loka 17, Chapter 83, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AS4VINI1SUTA. A son born to Su1rya of the wife of
<>Sutapas. There is this story about it in Brahmavai-
<>varta Pura1n2a. Once when the wife of Sutapas was on
<>a pilgrimage Su1rya happened to see her. The beautiful
<>and venerable lady refused to accede to the desire of
<>Su1rya and so the latter used force and took her. They
<>had a son who was named As4vini1suta. On her return
<>after the pilgrimage with her son she explained all that
<>happened and the sage sent both of them out. Su1rya
<>taught his son As4vini1suta astrology and made him a
<>master in that science. Knowing that, Sutapas cursed
<>him and said he would turn to be one very diseased.
<>Later the sage amended his curse and added that he
<>would be free from disease if he worshipped the sun.
<HI>ASVINI1TI1RTHA. Promises bodily splendour if one
<>takes a bath in this lake. (S4loka 21, Chapter 25,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>ATALA. This is one of the seven sections of Pa1ta1la. The
<>seven sections are: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tala1tala,
<>Maha1tala, Rasa1tala, Pa1ta1la. Of them Atala has been
<>described as follows: Atala is the first world of Pa1ta1la.
<>There reigns Bala, the son of Maya who is the famous
<>but haughty magician. He has created 96 Mayas who
<>are capable of granting all kinds of desires. Even now
<>certain persons who are interested in the practice of
<>Black magic, learn some of these 96 arts and practise
<>them. When this mighty fellow opens his mouth for
<>yawning, three groups of women known as Pum3s4cali1s,
<>Svairin2i1s and Ka1mini1s emerge from his mouth. He has
<>with him a rasa1yana called ha1t2aka with which he can
<>eaisly entice and seduce all who enter Atala and to
<>strengthen them for satisfying his lust. After enticing
<>them with it, he enjoys uncontrolled pleasure with
<>them, showering on them his amorous glances, bewitch- [Page072-a+ 63]
<>ing smiles and embraces. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama
<>Skandha).
<HI>AT2AVI1S4IKHARA. Name of a village in ancient India.
<>(M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 48).
<HI>ATHARVA(M). Among the Vedas, this has the fourth
<>place. It comprises different kinds of incantations of
<>occult powers for the destruction of enemies. Atharvan
<>the son of Vasis2t2ha was the author of this Veda. In
<>Chapter 6 of the third section of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a the
<>following reference is made to Atharvaveda: “Sumantu
<>Mahars2i who was of infinite glory, first taught this
<>Atharvaveda to his disciple Kabandha. (Sumantu
<>Mahars2i was the son of Jaimini, who was the disciple
<>of Vedavya1sa). Kabandha divided Atharvaveda into
<>two parts and communicated them to two Mahars2is
<>named Devadars4a and Pathya. Devadars4a's disciples
<>were: Medha1, Brahmabali, S4autka1yani and Pippala1da.
<>Pathya had three disciples named Ja1ba1li, Kumuda1di
<>and S4aunaka. They also made Atharvaveda compila-
<>tions. S4aunaka divided his compilation into two and
<>gave one part to Babhru and the other to Saindhava.
<>Mun5jikes4a learnt it from Saindhava and divided the
<>compilation first into two and later into three parts.
<>The five divisions of the Atharvaveda--Naks2atrakalpa,
<>Vedakalpa, Sam3hita1kalpa, A1n3girasakalpa and S4a1nti-
<>kalpa, were made by Mun5jikes4a. Naks2atrakalpa con-
<>tains Brahma's works: Sam3hita1kalpa contains Mantra
<>Vidhi; A1ngirasakalpa contains a1bhica1ra and S4a1ntikalpa
<>contains taming of horses, elephants etc.

<NI>When these mantras are chanted several oblations are
<>made to the sacrificial fire. Substances like Camata1, ghee,
<>rice, milk are thrown into the fire as offerings. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 262).
<HI>ATHARVA1 I. This muni is referred to in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 50, as a professional
<>chanter of Chandaveda. Once under the curse of Bhr2gu
<>Mahars2i, Agni hid himself under the sea. (See “AGNI”).
<>At that time, it was Atharva1 who, at the suggestion of
<>the Devas, went under the water and discovered Agni.
<>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 8).
<NI>Atharva1 recovered Agni, and re-created the worlds
<>which were lying dormant owing to the absence of fire.
<>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 19).
<NI>Atharva1 was born from Brahma1's face. His wife was
<>S4a1nti, the daughter of Kardama. Citti was another
<>name for S4a1nti. But there are some Pura1n2as which re-
<>fer to Citti as another wife of Atharva1. Also, there are
<>Pura1n2as which say that Atharva1 was An3giras himself.
<HI>ATHARVA1 II. This name has been used as a synonym
<>of S4iva. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 17, Verse
<>91).
<HI>ATHARVA1 III. In R2gveda another Atharva1 may be
<>seen. It is said that he was the author of the Atharva-
<>veda. After learning Brahmavidya1 from Brahma1, it
<>was this Atharva1 who first brought fire to the earth
<>from heaven. Atharva1 had two wives named S4a1nti and
<>Citti. This Atharva1 was the same person as Atharvan2a,
<>the son of Vasis2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha, Chap-
<>ter 1).
<HI>ATHARVA1N3GIRAS. See AN3GIRAS.
<HI>ATHARVAN2A. A son of Vasis2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, Fourth
<>Skandha, Verse 42).
<HI>AT2HIDA(M). Name of a Janastha1na (Town) in ancient

<HI>ATIBA1HU. He was a Gandharva born to Kas4yapa by
<>his wife Pradha1. He had three brothers: Ha1ha1, Hu1hu1
<>and Tumburu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse
<>51).
<HI>ATIBALA. A mantra. Vis4va1mitra who took the boys
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to the forest taught them two
<>mantras, Bala and Atibala, to liberate them from
<>hunger and thirst. Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 22)
<HI>ATIBALA I. The Mahars2i Atibala was the cause of the
<>death of S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a.
<NI>After the war with Ra1van2a, S4ri1 Ra1ma returned to Ayo-
<>dhya1 with his retinue and began his reign. After re-
<>nouncing Si1ta1 while S4ri1 Ra1ma was living in the palace
<>with Laks2man2a, S4atrughna and their families, one day
<>Brahma1 summoned Yama and said: “S4ri1 Ra1ma is the
<>incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. He has fulfilled all the pur-
<>poses of the incarnation. Now Vis2n2u has to be recalled
<>to Vaikun2t2ha”.
<NI>On hearing this, Yama assuming the guise of a Sanny-
<>a1si named Atibala appeared before S4ri1 Ra1ma. He said
<>he had to tell a secret to S4ri1 Ra1ma. Accordingly S4ri1
<>Ra1ma sent everyone else out of the audience chamber. [Page073-a+ 65]
<>Laks2man2a was asked to guard the entrance. It was
<>announced that if anyone entered the hall, Laks2man2a
<>would be killed.
<NI>At this stage, Mahars2i Durva1sas arrived at the entrance
<>accompanied by many of his disciples. He had come
<>after having performed penance for a thousand years
<>and in great hunger and thirst. He wanted to see the
<>King to ask for sumptuous food. Laks2man2a requested
<>him to wait a little but Durva1sas refused to do so. He
<>even threatened that he would reduce all of them to
<>ashes by his curse. Finding no alternative, Laks2man2a
<>entered the hall and informed S4ri1 Ra1ma of the situation.
<>Durva1sas was given a sumptuous meal. But for the ful-
<>filment of the condition Laks2man2a's death became neces-
<>sary. S4ri1 Ra1ma cried with a broken heart. The honest
<>Laks2man2a went alone to the Sarayu1 river and drowned
<>himself in its depths. Soon after, S4ri1 Ra1ma entrusting
<>the affairs of the state to others and in the presence of
<>thousands of spectators plunged into the Sarayu1 river
<>and renouncing his earthly life, returned to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>ATIBALA II. The name of a follower given to Skanda
<>by god Va1yu on the battle-field. (M.B., S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Verse 44).
<HI>ATIBALA III. There was another King named Atibala
<>who was a great scholar in Ni1tis4a1stra. From the tine
<>of his accession to the throne, he began to lead a
<>vicious life. This Atibala's father was a King named
<>Anan3ga. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 92).
<HI>ATIBHI1MA. One of the sons of the Agni, Tapa. (M.B.,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 220, Verse 11).
<HI>ATIKA1YA. One of the sons of Ra1van2a.
<NI>1) {%Previous Birth.%} This is a story concerning the initial
<>stage of the creation of the Universe. After completing
<>the task of creation Brahma1, in his pride fell into a sleep.
<>In order to slight Brahma1 a little, Maha1vis2n2u produced
<>two Ra1ks2asas called Madhu and Kait2abha from his ears.
<>Hearing their terrible roar Brahma1 woke up in fear and
<>fled to Maha1vis2n2u seeking refuge. Vis2n2u called Madhu
<>and Kait2abha and asked them what boon they
<>would like to ask. They proudly replied that they would
<>grant a boon to Vis2n2u. In that case Maha1vis2n2u wanted
<>them to grant him leave to kill them. They answered:
<>“We will not break our promise about granting the
<>boon. But since our passion for fighting has not been
<>abated, you must fulfil our eager desire.” Maha1vis2n2u
<>said: “I agree. But let my boon be carried out first.
<>After that I shall see that your wish is properly fulfill-
<>ed. After your death, one of you will be reborn under
<>the name of Khara and the other under the name of
<>Atika1ya. In the Treta1yuga I shall kill Khara in single
<>combat after allaying his passion for fighting. Laks2man2a
<>who is the incarnation of Ananta will fight with
<>Atika1ya to his full satisfaction and kill him. Thus both
<>of you will get Virakti and Mukti.”
<NI>After saying this, Maha1vis2n2u made the two asuras
<>stand on each of his thighs and killed them with his
<>Sudars4ana Cakra. They were born again as Khara and
<>Atika1ya. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is a story about the birth of Atika1ya
<>in the Yuddha Ka1n2d2a of Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a: After
<>his victory over Kubera Ra1van2a was returning in his
<>Pus2paka Vima1na. On his way he saw some beautiful
<>Gandharva women playing in the valley of Mayu1ragiri.
<>Their leader was Citra1n3gi1, the wife of Citra1n3gada. [Page073-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a seduced her and had a secret union with her. At
<>once she became pregnant and gave birth to a dazzlingly
<>bright baby. The mother handed over the child to
<>Ra1van2a and returned to the world of the Gandharvas.
<>Ra1van2a, in his paternal love, took the child into the
<>Vima1na and proceeded. On the way, the Vima1na
<>knocked against a mountain peak and the baby was
<>thrown overboard and fell in the forest. Ra1van2a stop-
<>ped the Vima1na and made a search for the baby in the
<>forest. He found the child without the slightest injury,
<>smiling and lying on a flat rock in the deep woods. He
<>failed in his attempt to take it up even though he used
<>ten of his hands. The child began to grow steadily in
<>size. Then he tried again to lift the baby up using all
<>his twenty arms. The boy, who had by this time grown
<>into enormous size, suddenly sprang up and getting in-
<>to the Vima1na took his seat in it. Ra1van2a gave him the
<>name Atika1ya. On his arrival in Lan3ka1, he presented
<>him as adopted son to the barren Dhanyama1la1.
<>Atika1ya was brought up by Dhanyama1la1.
<NI>3) {%The Boons.%} Atika1ya went to Gokarn2a and did pe-
<>nance to please Brahma1. Brahma1 appeared, but being
<>fully absorbed in Sama1dhi, Atika1ya was not aware of
<>his presence. Even his life-breath had been stopped.
<>Brahma1, by his power, instilled life-breath into him and
<>restored him to consciousness. He granted Atika1ya all
<>the boons he asked for. They were three in number.
<>The first was the gift of Brahma1stra which could smash
<>anyone. The second was the gift of an armour which
<>was unassailable by anyone. The third was absence of
<>thirst, desire and other cravings.
<NI>4) {%Education.%} Atika1ya went to Kaila1sa and received
<>his education from S4iva. He learnt all the sciences,
<>Arts, S4ruti, Smr2ti etc. from there. On the completion
<>of his course he asked what Gurudaks2in2a1 he should
<>pay. S4iva made him promise that he would never
<>practise Black magic. Pleased with him, S4iva awarded
<>him the Pa1s4upata1stra.
<NI>5) {%Victory in Battle.%} Atika1ya had an uncle, a Ra1ks2asa
<>named Candra. Once he was defeated by Indra. It was
<>at this time of chagrin that he came to know that
<>Atika1ya had reached Lan3ka1 with the Pa1s4upata1stra.
<>Candra Ra1ks2asa ordered Atika1ya to bring Indra as a
<>captive. Atika1ya went to Svarga (Heaven) and began
<>a war with Indra. Maha1vis2n2u who came to help Indra
<>used his Sudars4ana cakra. Atika1ya shot his Pa1s4u-
<>pata1stra. Knowing Atika1ya's history well, Maha1vis2n2u
<>brought the battle to a close. Both parties accepted the
<>position that Devendra had lost the battle and Atika1ya
<>had won.
<NI>6) {%Death.%} In the Ra1ma1yan2a battle Atika1ya fought
<>on the side of Ra1van2a. After a most terrible conflict,
<>Laks2man2a killed Atika1ya. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>ATILOMA1. An Asura who was killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>ATIMANYU. He was one of the ten sons of Manu.
<HI>ATIRATHA. There was a King named Matina1ra in
<>Pu1ruvam3s4a. (See PU1RUVAM3S4A). Four sons were born
<>to him: Tam3su, Maha1n, Atiratha and Druhyu. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 14).
<HI>ATIRA1TRA. He was one of the ten children born to
<>Manu by Nad2vala1. (See MANU VAM3S4A). Kuru,
<>Pu1ru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2t2oma,
<>Atira1tra, Sudyumna and Atimanyu were the names of [Page074-a+ 65]
<>the ten brilliant sons of Nad2vala1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part
<>I, Chapter 13).
<HI>ATIS2AN2D2A. After his death Balabhadra Ra1ma went
<>to Pa1ta1la in the guise of Ananta. All the serpents wor-
<>shipped him. Among them was a serpent named Ati-
<>s2an2d2a. (M.B., Mausala Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<HI>ATIS4R2N3GA. Vindhya Presented two pa1rs2adas to Skanda
<>on the battlefield. They were Atis4r2n3ga and Ucchr2n3ga.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verses 49, 50).
<HI>ATISTHIRA. Maha1meru presented two Pa1rs2adas nam-
<>ed Atisthira and Sthira to Skanda on the battlefield.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 48).
<HI>ATITHI (guest). In ancient Bha1rata Atithi-satka1ra
<>(hospitality to a guest) was considered as a yajn5a. In
<>Manusmr2ti, Chapter 100, Verse 3, it is said that even if
<>one lives on the scattered grains in the fields after har-
<>vest, and even if penance is offered in the midst of
<>Pan5ca1gni (five fires) unless the Brahmin who comes
<>as a guest is fed, all virtuous deeds would be useless.
<>Besides, Manu has made the following remarks about

<NI>“A new visitor at night must be treated as an Atithi.
<>An Atithi is one who comes occasionally, not daily.
<>But one who lives in your village and goes about as a
<>vagabond for a living, does not deserve to be treated as
<>an Atithi. The guest who comes either before or after
<>mealtime should not be sent away without being fed.
<>Even a Vais4ya or S4u1dra who comes as a guest to a
<>Brahmin's house has to be given food when the servants
<>are given food.”
<HI>ATITHIGVA. He was a King referred to in the R2g-
<>veda. He had another name, “Divoda1sa”. This King
<>had fought several battles against Asuras with the help
<>of Indra. It is said that once, being afraid of the Asuras,
<>he tried to hide himself under the water. (R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 10, Su1kta 53; R2gveda, Man2d2ala

<HI>ATRI I.
<NI>1) {%The son of Brahma1.%} Atri Mahars2i was one of the
<>ma1nasaputras of Brahma1. The ma1nasaputras were:
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 10).
<NI>2) {%One of the Saptars2is.%} Brahma's sons, Mari1ci, An3giras,
<>Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasis2t2ha are known
<>as the Saptars2is (seven sages). (M.B., S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 208).
<NI>3) {%Creator of the pracetases.%} The sage Pra1ci1nabarhis was
<>born in the family of Atri Mahars2i. Ten Pracetases
<>(Praja1patis) were born as the sons of this Muni. (M.B.,
<>S4akti Parva, Chapter 208).
<NI>4) {%Citra S4ikhan2d2i1.%} Among the seven Munis known as
<>Citra S4ikhan2d2i1s, we see Atri Mahars2i as one of the
<>As2t2aprakr2tis which form the basis of the Universe.
<NI>5) {%Important events.%} (1) {%How Maha1vis2n2u became Atri's son.%}
<>Kas4yapa had a son named Kas4ipu. He was a very mighty
<>ruler and carried on his reign in an ungodly manner.
<>In a terrible battle which took place at that time between
<>the Devas and Asuras Kas4ipu was killed. Prahla1da be- [Page074-b+ 65]
<>came the Asura King. Then there was a battle between
<>Indra and Prahla1da. After six years' war, Prahla1da with-
<>drew, defeated. Later Maha1bali, the son of Virocana
<>(grandson of Prahla1da) became emperor of Asuras. War
<>broke out again between Maha1bali and Indra. In this
<>war, Maha1vis2n2u helped Indra. The Asuras were utterly
<>defeated. They sought refuge with S4ukra, the Asura guru.
<>S4ukra promised to help them. He set out to the Hima1-
<>layas to receive a powerful mantra from S4iva. The
<>Asuras kept waiting for S4ukra's return.
<NI>At this stage, Maha1vis2n2u who was the protector of Indra,
<>came to S4ukra's a1s4rama and killed S4ukra's mother,
<>Ka1vyama1ta1. Seeing this impudence of Maha1vis2n2u, Bhr2gu
<>Mahars2i was enraged and cursed him that he should be
<>born many times in human wombs. It is on account of
<>this that Maha1vis2n2u had to take many avata1ras (incar-
<>nations). It was in this way that Maha1vis2n2u incarnated
<>as Datta1treya, the son of Atri. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th
<>Skandha).
<NI>(2) {%Atri and Para1s4ara.%} It was a time when Vasis2t2ha and
<>Vis4va1mitra were in a state of mutual ill-will. Once King
<>Kalma1s2apa1da was going about in the forest on a hunting
<>expedition. He met S4akti, the eldest son of Vasis2t2ha in
<>the forest. The King did not respect him properly. S4akti
<>transformed Kalma1s2apa1da into a Ra1ks2asa by his curse.
<>The Ra1ks2asa who was also a cannibal, first swallowed
<>S4akti himself. Vis4va1mitra offered whatever help he
<>could, to destroy Vasis2t2ha's family. Kalma1s2apa1da ate
<>successively all the 100 sons of Vasis2t2ha. Vasis2t2ha, in great
<>sorrow and Sakti's wife, Adr2s4yanti1 lived in an a1s4rama.
<>Adr2s4yanti1 was pregnant at the time of S4akti's death.
<>In due course she gave birth to a boy who was called
<>Para1s4ara and who later on became the father of Vya1sa.
<>when Para1s4ara grew up, he came to know that his father
<>S4akti was eaten by the Ra1ks2asa. Enraged at this, he
<>started a yajn5a to annihilate the whole race of Ra1ks2asas.
<>As the yajn5a gained intensity and force Atri Muni arrived
<>there with certain other Mahars2is and dissuaded Para1-
<>s4ara from the yajn5a. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 181).
<NI>(3) {%Atri's dispute with Vainya.%} Atri Mahars2i and his
<>wife once got ready to go for Vanava1sa. At that time the
<>poor Mahars2i's wife was in great distress because they
<>had no money to be distributed to their disciples and
<>children. She requested her husband to go to King
<>Vainya and to beg for some money. Accordingly the
<>Mahars2i visited King Vainya at his ya1gas4a1la1 (The shed
<>where a ya1ga is held). He began to flatter Vainya by say-
<>ing that he was the first among kings and so on. Vainya
<>did not like it. He began to dispute with Atri. Vainya
<>remarked that Indra was the first King. To settle the
<>dispute they went together to Sanatkuma1ra Muni.
<>Sanatkuma1ra sent them away reconciled. After that
<>Vainya gave Atri much wealth. After distributing all this
<>wealth among their sons and disciples Atri and his wife
<>set out to the forest to perform penance.
<NI>(4) {%How Atri became Sun and Moon.%} Once there was
<>a fierce battle between Devas and Asuras. Owing to the
<>shower of arrows from the Asuras, the Sun and Moon
<>became dim. Darkness spread everywhere. The Devas
<>began to grope in the dark. They requested Atri Maha-
<>rs2i to find a remedy for this. Moved by their distress,
<>Atri suddenly transformed himself into the Sun and
<>Moon. The Moon gave light to the Devas. The Sun
<>burnt up the Asuras by his intense heat. Thus the
<>Devas were saved. This story was told by Va1yu Bhaga- [Page075-a+ 65]
<>vana, to Arjuna. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 156).
<NI>(5) {%Atri and King Vr2s2a1darbhi.%} In the Maha1bha1rata we
<>find a story about a difference of opinion between
<>King Vr2s2a1darbhi and some Mahars2is. This story was
<>told by Bhi1s2ma to Yudhis2t2hira about the kind of per-
<>sons from whom Brahmins may accept gifts. Once the
<>Munis, Kas4yapa, Atri, Vasis2t2ha, Bharadva1ja, Gautama,
<>Vis4va1mitra, Jamadagni, and Pas4usakha1, with Arun-
<>dhati1 and Gan2d2a1, who were the wives of two Munis,
<>travelled round the world. Their object was to go to
<>Brahmaloka. At that time there was drought in the
<>world. King Vr2s2a1darbhi, the son of S4ibi, suggested that
<>the above-mentioned Munis should be called and given
<>wealth. They refused to accept it. Vr2s2a1darbhi became
<>angry. He performed Homa in A1havani1ya1gni and from
<>the agnikun2d2a, the Ra1ks2asi1 Ya1tudha1ni1 (Kr2tya1) arose.
<>Vr2s2a1darbhi sent Ya1tudha1ni1 to destroy Atri and all
<>other Munis. As Ya1tudha1ni1 was guarding a lotus pond
<>in the forest, the munis led by Atri happened to come
<>that way. The Mahars2is were able to recognize
<>Ya1tudha1ni1. They beat her with their tridan2d2u (Trident
<>or a kind of magic wand) and reduced her to ashes.
<>After satisfying their hunger by eating the lotus flowers
<>the Mahars2is went to Brahmaloka. (M.B., Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 93).
<NI>(6) {%Atri and S4ra1ddha.%} There is a passage in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata in which Atri gives advice to the emperor Nimi
<>who belonged to Atri's family. The story of how S4ra1ddha
<>originated in the world which Bhi1s2ma had told Dharma-
<>putra was retold by Atri. A son named Datta1treya
<>was born to Atri, the son of Brahma1. Datta1treya be-
<>came King. Nimi was his son. Nimi's son died after
<>one thousand years. Nimi who was in deep grief at the
<>death of his son, ordained a S4ra1ddha in memory of his
<>son. On that occasion Atri Mahars2i came there and
<>explained to Nimi the importance of S4ra1ddha. (M.B.,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 91, Verses 20-44)
<NI>(7) {%How Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara (S4iva) were born
<>as sons of Atri.%} There is no other woman in the Pura1n2as
<>who surpasses S4i1la1vati1 in her fidelity to her husband. In
<>order to enable Ugras4ravas, her husband, to satisfy his
<>passion, she once carried him on her own shoulders to
<>a prostitute's house. On the way, Ma1n2d2avya Muni
<>pronounced a curse that Ugras4ravas should die before
<>sunrise. The grief-stricken S4i1la1vati1 pronounced a
<>counter-curse that the sun should not rise on the next
<>day. As the sun failed to rise, the Trimu1rtis (Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva), accompanied by Anasu1ya1, Atri's wife,
<>went to S4i1la1vati1. Anasu1ya1 persuaded S4i1la1vati1 to with-
<>draw her curse. The Trimu1rtis who were happy at the
<>success of their mission (of bringing about the Sunrise)
<>asked Anasu1ya1 to demand any boon she wanted. Ana-
<>su1ya1 expressed her wish that the Trimu1rtis (Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva) should be born as her sons and they
<>agreed.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u, under the name of Datta1treya, was born
<>as the son of Anasu1ya1. S4iva was born to her under the
<>name of Durva1sas. There is a story about it in the Brah-
<>ma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Once S4iva got angry with the Devas.
<>They began to flee for life. But Brahma1 alone did not
<>run away. S4iva who became more furious at this,
<>pinched off one of the heads of Brahma1. Still he was
<>not pacified. Pa1rvati1 who was alarmed, approached S4iva
<>and begged him to suppress his anger. At her request,
<>S4iva's fury was transferred and deposited in Anasu1ya1, [Page075-b+ 64]
<>Atri's wife. Durva1sas is the embodiment of that element
<>of S4iva's fury.
<NI>According to the promise, Brahma1 also took his birth
<>as the moon from Anasu1ya1, the wife of Atri. (For that
<>story, see PURU1RAVAS). There is a story about that
<>also in the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Once when Brahma1
<>was performing the task of creation, he experienced
<>carnal passsion. Sarasvati1 was the offspring of that
<>passion. When Brahma1 saw her, he fell in love with her
<>also. This made him feel angry towards Ka1madeva. He
<>pronounced a curse that Ka1madeva should be burnt up
<>in the fire from S4iva's eye. (This is why Ka1madeva was
<>later burnt to death by S4iva). Although Ka1ma had
<>retreated from Brahma1 his passion had not been sup-
<>pressed. Brahma1 transferred his passion to Atri Mahars2i.
<>The Mahars2i gave it to Anasu1ya1, his wife. Since she
<>was unable to bear such a violent passion, she gave it
<>back to her husband. That passion emerged from Atri's
<>eye in the form of the Moon. This is why lovers experi-
<>ence strong passion for each other at the time of the
<>rising of the moon. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapters
<>39-43).
<NI>(8) {%Atri and Gan3ga1 Devi1.%} Once, while Atri Mahars2i
<>was performing penance in Ka1mada forest, there was
<>a terrible drought in the country. At that time, his wife
<>Anasu1ya1 made a S4ivalin3ga of sand and offered worship
<>to it. Then Atri asked her to give him a little water.
<>There was no water anywhere. Suddenly Gan3ga1 Devi1
<>appeared there and said to Anasu1ya1: “There will be
<>a hole here. Water will come out of it in a torrent.”
<NI>Pure water began to flow from the place pointed out
<>by Gan3ga1 Devi1. Anasu1ya1 begged Gan3ga1 Devi1 to stay
<>there for a month. Gan3ga1 Devi1 agreed to do so on con-
<>dition that Anasu1ya1 would transfer her Tapas4s4akti to
<>her for one month.
<NI>Atri was pleased by drinking the water. He asked Ana-
<>su1ya1 where she got such nice fresh water. She explain-
<>ed to him all matters. Atri expressed his desire to see
<>Gan3ga1 Devi1. She appeared before him at once. Ana-
<>su1ya1 prayed to her that Gan3ga1 should continue to exist
<>in the world always. Gan3ga1 Devi1 answered that she
<>would do so if Anasu1ya1 was prepared to give her the
<>fruit of one year's Tapas4s4akti and of devoted service to
<>her husband. Anasu1ya1 agreed to that condition. Sud-
<>denly S4iva appeared there in the shape of a Lin3ga. At
<>the request of Atri and Anasu1ya1 S4iva took his seat
<>there permanently assuming the name of “Atri1s4vara”.

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u, Brahma1,
<>Bhr2gu, Cyavana, Aurva.
<NI>Cyavana Mahars2i married A1rus2i1, daughter of Manu.
<>Aurva was her child who was the grandfather of Jamad-
<>agni and the great grandfather of Paras4ura1ma.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} The Preceptors of the Bhr2gu dynasty were the
<>hereditary gurus of the Kings of Hehaya. Kr2tavi1rya a
<>famous King of the Hehaya dynasty and father of Ka1r-
<>tavi1rya1rjuna had his education from a Bhr2gu r2s2i living
<>in his a1s4rama. On competing his education the king
<>paid lavishly and the Bhr2gus became rich thereafter.
<>Kr2tavi1rya died and his sons did not very much like the
<>Bha1rgavas (Bhr2gus) becoming rich by the wealth of
<>their ancestors. Knowing this the Bhr2gus started bury-
<>ing their wealth under the earth. Once a Ks2atriya [Page076-b+ 65]
<>king forcibly dug out from the house of a Bhr2gu the
<>wealth he had safely buried and from that day onwards
<>the Ks2atriyas and the Bha1rgavas became enemies. The
<>Bhr2gus were hunted down by the Ks2atriya kings and the
<>Bha1rgavas frightened by this move left their abode and
<>went and hid in Caves in mountains far away. Among
<>those who thus fled was A1rus2i1, wife of Cyavana. A1rus2i1
<>was pregnant at that time and she hid her ‘Garbha’ in
<>her thighs while fleeing. A brahmin woman who saw
<>this went and informed the Ks2atriyas and they imme-
<>diately went and caught hold of her. Then the thigh
<>broke and a boy came out of it. Because he was born
<>from the thighs the boy was named Aurva. (U1ru1=
<>Thigh and so, born of a thigh). (Chapter 179, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%The effulgence of Aurva.%} Aurva was born with fiery
<>radiance and the sudden effulgence made the Ks2atriya
<>Kings blind. Frightened they craved for pardon and
<>praised him. They got back their eyesight then.
<NI>4) {%Aurva and Bad2ava1gni.%} Aurva bore a deep grudge
<>against the Ks2atriyas who had massacred his fore-
<>fathers. Aurva started doing rigorous penance and by
<>the force of his austerities the world started to burn. At
<>that stage the Pitr2s appeared before him and persuaded
<>him to withdraw from his penance. Aurva then told
<>them thus: “Pitr2s, while I was lying in the thigh-womb
<>of my mother I heard hideous groans from outside and
<>they were of our mothers when they saw the heads of
<>our fathers being cut off by the swords of the Ks2atriyas.
<>Even from the womb itself I nurtured a fierce hatred
<>towards the Ks2atriyas. No helping hand was raised
<>before the pitiable wails of our mothers”.
<NI>The Pitr2s were astounded at the firmness of the vow of
<>Aurva and horrified at the thought of what would
<>happen if the penance was continued. They pleaded
<>again to cease his austerities and then submitting to
<>their request Aurva withdrew the fire of his penance
<>and forced it down into the sea. It is now believed
<>that this fire taking the shape of a horse-head is still
<>living underneath the sea vomiting heat at all times.
<>This fire is called Bad2ava1gni. More about this can be
<>had under the head Bad2ava1gni. (Chapter 180, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Aurva and the birth of Sagara.%} Ayodhya1 was once
<>ruled by a celebrated King of Iks2va1ku dynasty named
<>Suba1hu. He had as his wife Ya1davi1 a good natured and
<>well behaved woman who was a gem among queens.
<>One day Ta1lajam3gha a King of the Hehaya line of
<>rulers who was then the King of Ma1his2mati1 defeated
<>Suba1hu in a battle. Ya1davi1 was then pregnant. Jealous
<>co-wives poisoned her; Ya1davi1 did not die but the
<>poison affected the child in the womb.
<NI>After the defeat, Suba1hu and Ya1davi1 went and stayed
<>with Aurva in his a1s4rama. For seven years they lived
<>there and then Suba1hu died. Grief-stricken Ya1davi1 was
<>about to jump into the funeral pyre and end her life
<>when Aurva stopped her from the act pointing out that
<>she was soon to deliver a child. After a few months she
<>delivered a son and Aurva called him ‘Sagara’ meaning
<>one with ‘gara’ (poison) in him. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 16, 17).
<NI>6) {%Aurva and the sister of Garud2a.%} Garud2a, son of
<>Vinata1, had a sister named Sumati. Upamanyu, a sage,
<>wanted to marry her but neither she nor her relatives
<>liked it. Enraged at this the sage cursed Sumati saying [Page077-a+ 65]
<>that the brahmin who married her would have his head
<>burst. The marriage of Sumati thus remained a prob-
<>lem for her parents. There was a friend of Vinata1, a
<>sannya1sini1, living in a forest and to find a way to escape
<>from the curse Vinata1 sent Garud2a to her. The sannya1-
<>sini1 advised Garud2a to approach Aurva to find a solution
<>for the problem and Aurva was therefore approached
<>for advice.
<NI>It was at this time that the people of Ayodhya1 came in
<>search of Suba1hu and Ya1davi1 who had left them years
<>before. When they knew of Suba1hu's death they were
<>plunged in sorrow but were glad to know a son of
<>Suba1hu, Sagara, had grown up to be a successor to
<>Suba1hu. When Garud2a made Aurva acquainted with
<>the pitiable tale of his sister Aurva decreed that Sumati
<>should marry a Ks2atriya instead of a brahmin and thus
<>tide over the curse. He then asked Sagara to marry
<>Sumati and blessed them saying that Sagara would one
<>day become an emperor and perform an As4vamedha
<>ya1ga. Aurva then sent Sagara along with the people
<>to Ayodhya1 where Sagara after defeating all his enemies
<>became the emperor of Bha1ratavars2a. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 18-21).
<NI>7) {%Sagara's sons and how Aurva helped in getting them.%}
<>Sagara ruled the land for three thousand years. He had
<>besides Sumati another wife, Kes4ini1. Both of them bore
<>no sons for Sagara. Dejected he entrusted the adminis-
<>tration of the state with his ministers and left for the
<>a1s4rama of Aurva. Aurva blessed them and prophesied
<>that Kes4ini1 would deliver a son to continue the dynasty
<>and that Sumati would deliver sixty thousand sons of
<>no great use at all. Sagara and his wives, returned to
<>the palace and very soon both his wives became preg-
<>nant. In due time Kes4ini1 delivered a son who was
<>named Asaman5jas. But Sumati gave birth to a lump of
<>flesh. Greatly pained the King was about to throw it
<>away when Aurva appeared there and stopped him from
<>doing that. He directed him to cut the piece of flesh
<>into sixty thousand pieces and put one piece each in a
<>jar of ghee. Every year one prince would be born from
<>one of them. Thus Sumati got sixty thousand sons.
<>(Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 92).
<NI>8) {%Teaching of Aurva.%} In the evening of his life Sagara
<>went and stayed in the a1s4rama of Aurva. Aurva gave
<>him instructions on many a divine subject. He taught
<>him about the importance of the four a1s4ramas, the
<>rituals to be practised by the different castes of Bra1h-
<>man2a, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra and many such
<>other things. Finally Aurva gave Sagara Brahmajn5a1na.
<>(Chapter 8, Am3s4am 3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).

<>Bhr2gu, Khya1ti, wife of Bhr2gu, Cyavana, son of Bhr2gu
<>and Aurva, son of Cyavana. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,

<HI>AURVA II. A brahmin living in the country of Ma1lava.
<>This brahmin got a daughter named S4ami1ka by his wife
<>Sumedha. She was married very early to Manda1ra, son

<>to Aurva to bring his wife home. Aurva sent them both
<>to the house of Manda1ra with his blessings. On their
<>way home they met the Mahars2i Bhus4un2d2i and burst
<>into laughter at his sight. The sage cursed them and [Page077-b+ 65]
<>made them into two trees. When Aurva found his
<>daughter and son-in-law missing he started a search for
<>them. Then he came to know that both of them had
<>changed into trees by a curse. Aurva and his wife then
<>prayed to God for help. Aurva then lived in the tree
<>of S4ama1 in the shape of Agni and S4aunaka made an
<>idol of Gan2apati with the root of the Manda1ra tree and
<>worshipped him. Gan2apati was pleased by the devotional

<>story behind the place getting this name.
<NI>At the forest of Dan2d2aka S4ri1 Ra1ma killed many demons.
<>The force of the arrows took the skulls of the demons
<>to far off places in the forest. One of the skulls thus
<>sent far fell on the feet of a sage named Mahodara
<>who was then going that way. The skull went deep
<>into his foot and not only did it wound his foot
<>but it stuck to his foot so hard that it could not
<>be drawn out also. With his foot in pains the sage
<>visited all the holy places but with no relief to his pain.
<>At last Mahodara came to Aus4anasa and to his surprise
<>the skull came off from his foot healing his wound. He
<>remained there for some time and obtained many divine
<>attainments. From then onwards the place was called
<>‘Kapa1lamocana’. After this incident Brahma1, Vis4va1mitra,
<>Balabhadrara1ma and many such divine persons visited

<>Budha was born to Candra, Puru1ravas to Budha, A1yus
<>to Pura1ravas, Nahus2a to A1yus, Yaya1ti to Nahus2a and
<>Yadu to Yaya1ti. Yadu had five sons, the eldest of whom

<HI>AVATA1RA. (Incarnation). The incarnations of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u:--
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God takes three kinds of incar-
<>nations such as avata1ra, a1ves4a and am3s4a. That which
<>has full power is avata1ra; that which has power only
<>for the time being is a1ves4a and partial incarnation in
<>am3s4a1vata1ra.
<F>*) See Am3s4a1vata1ra.</F> The incarnations of Vis2n2u are count-
<>less. Hermits, Manus, Devas (gods) and sons of Manus
<>are incarnations in part (am3s4a1vata1ras) of Vis2n2u. Com-
<>plete avata1ras are ten in numbers of which Balabhadra
<>Ra1ma is not considered as an avata1ra by some. In-
<>stead of him they place Buddha.
<NI>{%b) Reason for the incarnations.%} Maha1vis2n2u has taken so
<>many incarnations in the world. In the S4ri1 Maha1devi1
<>Bha1gavata a story occurs to the effect that Maha1vis2n2u
<>was forced to take so large a number of incarnations
<>due to the curse of the great hermit Bhr2gu. The story
<>is as follows: Kas4yapa had a son named Kas4ipu. He
<>was daring and brave and ruled the country as an
<>enemy of the Gods. There arose a severe battle between
<>the gods and the Asuras. Kas4ipu was killed in that
<>battle. After Kas4ipu his son Prahla1da became King.
<>He too was an enemy of the Gods. So there was a
<>battle between Indra and Prahla1da. The battle conti-
<>nued for a hundred years. At last Prahla1da was defeat-
<>ed. He felt very sorry at the defeat. So he anointed
<>Bali, son of Virocana, as King and leaving the Kingdom
<>he went to the Gandhama1dana and began to do
<>penance. The fight continued between Bali and Indra.
<NI>In this fight Maha1vis2n2u helped Indra. The Asuras were
<>completely destroyed. The defeated Asuras went to
<>their teacher S4ukra who promised to protect them by
<>spells and incantations and herbs. The Gods knew
<>that S4ukra had undertaken to protect the asuras.
<NI>Leaving the asuras behind, S4ukra went to Kaila1sa to
<>get more power of spells and incantations from S4iva.
<>Before going to Kaila1sa S4ukra had asked the Asuras
<>to wait for him with faith. After this the Asuras sent
<>Prahla1da to the Gods for a truce. Prahla1da, though an
<>Asura was in good favour with the Gods. He reached
<>the court of Indra and said, “Gods, we have no desire
<>at all for war. We have decided to spend the remain-
<>ing period in penance wearing barks of trees and tufts
<>of hair. How wicked a deed is battle and how delight-
<>ful it is to become a devotee of God! So hereafter you
<>will not be troubled by us. Likewise I hope you will
<>not do us innocent people any harm.”
<NI>The gods believed Prahla1da. The Asuras, in the guise
<>of hermits waited for S4ukra in the hermitage of Kas4-
<>yapa. S4ukra reached Kaila1sa and bowed before S4iva and
<>requested that he might be given the power of defeat-
<>ing the Gods by some means quite unknown to Br2has-
<>pati the teacher of the devas (Gods). S4iva was in [Page079-a+ 65]
<>trouble. He could refuse neither S4ukra nor the Gods.
<>At last he told hermit S4ukra that to come by such a
<>spell he had to stand head downwards, inhaling smoke
<>for a thousand years. S4iva said so thinking that when
<>the dreadful nature of the feat was considered, S4ukra
<>might desist from the attempt. But S4ukra began that
<>penance instantly.
<NI>The Gods understood everything. The deceit of the
<>Asuras, the crookedness of S4ukra all were now clear to
<>them. They trembled with fear and began to consult
<>how to get over the difficult situation. Finally they
<>decided to go to war with the Asuras. The gods did
<>accordingly. The Asuras were in trouble. They were
<>not strong enough to face the Gods. So they all went
<>to Ka1vyama1ta1, the mother of S4ukra. The devas (gods)
<>with Maha1vis2n2u at their head chased the Asuras. Ka1vya-
<>ma1ta1, by the merits of her devotional meditation
<>petrified Maha1vis2n2u and Indra. Maha1vis2n2u thought of
<>his Sudars4ana (wheel-weapon of Vis2n2u) which instant-
<>ly made its appearance and cut off the head of Ka1vya-
<>ma1ta1. The great hermit Bhr2gu got angry because Maha1-
<>vis2n2u committed woman-slaughter, and cursed him thus:
<>“You are a crooked being, a viper, a deceit. The
<>hermits who adore you as the seat of all that is good
<>are mere fools; you are wicked, of a black character,
<>and I curse you to take countless incarnations in the
<>world, and painful confinement by and by because of
<>your sins.” (S4ri1 Maha1devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<NI>Thus having cursed Vis2n2u, the hermit Bhr2gu took some
<>water from his water-pot and sprinkled it on the face of
<>Ka1vyama1ta1, who woke up as if from sleep. (For the
<>remaining portion of the story see S4ukra).
<NI>2) {%Das4a1vata1ras. (The ten Incarnations).%} Owing to the curse
<>of Bhr2gu, mentioned above, Maha1vis2n2u had to under-
<>take so many incarnations, complete as well as partial.
<>Complete incarnations are ten in number. They are
<>called Das4a1vata1ras (The Ten Incarnations).

<NI>1) {%Matsya1vata1ra. (Fish Incarnation).%} To Kas4yapa, the
<>son of Mari1ci, and the grandson of Brahma1 a son
<>was born, by his wife Aditi. He was called Vivasva1n
<>and the Manu who was the son of Vivasva1n is known
<>as Vaivasvata Manu or Satyavrata Manu. It was dur-
<>ing the time of this Manu that Vis2n2u incarnated as a
<>Matsya (fish).
<NI>Once, while Brahma1 was reciting the Vedas (the Scrip-
<>tures) Hayagri1va, an asura, stole the Vedas from the
<>side of Brahma1 and with them he went under water to
<>the bottom of the ocean and hid himself there. So
<>Maha1vis2n2u decided to take the form of a fish to recover
<>the stolen Vedas.
<NI>Vaivasvata Manu, the first and foremost of the godfear-
<>ing, was once doing penance in a place known as Badari1.
<>He got down into the river Kr2tama1la1 to take a bath.
<>Then a small fish said to the Manu: “Oh King, I am
<>afraid of large fishes. So please don't forsake me”. Hear- [Page079-b+ 65]
<>ing this the Kind Manu took the fish in his hand and
<>put it in an earthenware pot and brought it up. In a
<>few days the fish began to grow. When the pot became
<>insufficient the King put it in a larger pot. When that
<>also became too small, the King put the fish in a pond.
<>When the pond could not hold the fish any longer the
<>King put it in the Ganges at its request. After a few days
<>the Ganges also became too small for the fish. Finally
<>the fish told the King: “Oh, King, within seven days
<>there will be a great flood in the world. You should
<>make a boat and take the seven hermit-sages with you
<>in the boat and escape. I will help you.”
<NI>Hearing this he got an immensely large boat ready and
<>obeyed the instructions of the fish. Within seven days
<>rain started in torrents. Everything in the world, the
<>moving and the not moving, were under the flood. A
<>horn began to sprout from the head of the fish. Manu
<>tied his boat on that horn. The fish reached the summit
<>of the Hima1layas with the boat, which was tied to the
<>highest peak. Since the peak came to be called ‘Nau-
<>bandhana S4r2n3ga’ (The peak to which boat is tied).
<>The rain ceased to pour. It was seen that everything
<>in the world had been destroyed except the Manu and
<>the seven hermit-sages and some of the germs, saved
<>in the boat. (This story occurs in the great Hindi work
<>‘Ka1ma1yani1’ of Jayas4an3kar Prasa1d). (M.B., Aran2ya
<>Parva, Chapter 187; Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 2; Bha1gavata
<>8th Skandha, Chapter 24).
<NI>This story of the incarnation of Vis2n2u as fish is seen in
<>the Bible figuratively. “In the order of the generations
<>of Adam, the first creation of God, S4eth, Enos; Kaina1n,
<>Mahali1l, Ja1red, Enoch, Methu1selah, Lamech and Noah
<>were born. When Noah was five hundred years old he
<>begot Shem, Ham and Japheth.
<NI>There was a great flood during the time of Noah. God
<>said to him: “The end of all flesh is come before one;
<>for the earth is filled with violence through them, and
<>behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee
<>an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
<>ark and shalt paint it within and without with pitch.
<>And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of. The
<>length of the ark should be three hundred cubits, the
<>breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty
<>cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark and in a
<>cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the ark
<>shalt thou set in the side thereof, with lower, second and
<>third stories shalt thou make it. And behold, I, even I,
<>do bring a flood of water up on the earth. to destroy all
<>flesh wherein is the breadth of life from under heaven
<>and everything that is in the earth shall die. But with
<>thee will I establish my covenant, and thou shalt come
<>into the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy
<>sons' wives with thee, and of every living thing of all
<>flesh, two of every sort, shalt thou bring into the ark to
<>keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and fe-
<>male. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after
<>their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth
<>after their kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee
<>to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food
<>that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee, and it
<>shall be for food for thee and for them.” Thus did Noah
<>according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<NI>And the Lord said unto Noah, “Come thou and all thy
<>house into the ark, for thee Have I seen righteous be-
<>fore me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou [Page080-a+ 65]
<>shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female
<>and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
<>his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male
<>and the female to keep seed alive up on the face of all
<>the earth. For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain
<>up on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every
<>living substance that I have made will I destroy from
<>off the earth.” And Noah did according unto all that
<>the Lord commanded him.
<NI>And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of
<>waters was up on the earth. And Noah went in, and
<>his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him into
<>the ark because of the waters of the flood. Of clean
<>beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and
<>of everything that creepeth upon the earth. There went
<>in two and two unto Noah into the ark the male and
<>the female as God had commanded Noah. And it came
<>to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were
<>upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's
<>life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the
<>month the same day were all the fountains of the
<>great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were
<>opened and the rain was up on the earth for forty
<>days and forty nights. In the self-same day entered
<>Noah and Shem, and Ham and japheth the sons of
<>Noah and Noah's wife and the wives of the sons
<>with them into the ark. They and every beast after
<>his kind and all the cattle after their kind and
<>every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
<>and every fowl after his earth after his kind, every
<>bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah
<>into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the
<>breadth of life. And they that went in, went in male
<>and female of all flesh as God had commanded him
<>and the Lord shut him in. And the flood was forty days
<>upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up
<>the ark and it was lifted up above the earth. And the
<>waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
<>earth and the ark went up on the face of the waters.
<>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth
<>and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven
<>were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters
<>prevail and the mountains were covered. And all the
<>flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and
<>of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that
<>creepeth up on the earth, and every man. All in whose
<>nostrils was the breadth of life, of all that was in the
<>dry land, died. And every living substance was des-
<>troyed which was up on the face of the ground both
<>man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl
<>of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.
<>And Noah only remained alive, and they that were
<>with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon
<>the earth for hundred and fifty days.
<NI>And God remembered Noah and every living thing
<>and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and
<>God made a wind to pass over the earth and the
<>waters became calm. The fountains also of the deep
<>and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain
<>from heaven was restrained. And the waters returned
<>from off the earth continually and after the end of the
<>hundred and fifty days, the waters were abated. And the
<>ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day
<>of the month upon the mountains of Ara1rat. And the
<>waters decreased continually until the tenth month. [Page080-b+ 65]
<>In the tenth month on the first day of the month
<>were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to
<>pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the
<>window of the ark which he had made. And he sent
<>forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters
<>were dried up from off the earth. Also he sent forth
<>a dove from him to see if the waters were abated
<>from off the face of the ground. But the dove found
<>no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned
<>unto him into the ark for the waters were on
<>the face of the whole earth. Then Noah put forth
<>his hand and took her and pulled her to the ark. And
<>he stayed yet other seven days. And again he sent
<>forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came
<>in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth
<>was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that
<>the waters were abated from off the earth. And he
<>stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove,
<>which returned not again unto him anymore. And it
<>came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
<>first month, the first day of the month the waters were
<>dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the
<>covering of the ark and looked and beheld the face of
<>the ground was dry. And in the second month on the
<>seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth
<>dried. And God spake unto Noah saying: “Go forth of
<>the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons'
<>wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living thing
<>that is with thee, of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and
<>of every creeping thing that creepeth up on the earth,
<>that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be
<>fruitful and multiply up on the earth. And Noah went
<>forth and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives
<>with him. Every beast, every creeping thing and every
<>fowl and whatsoever creep up on the earth after their
<>kinds went forth out of the ark. And Noah built an
<>altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and
<>of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the
<>altar. And the Lord smelt a sweet savour and the Lord
<>said in his heart: “I will not again curse the ground
<>anymore for man's sake. For the imagination of man's
<>heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again smite
<>anymore every thing as I have done. While the earth
<>remaineth seed time and harvest and cold and heat
<>and summer and winter and day and night shall not
<>cease. (Holy Bible, Genesis, Chapters 6, 7 and 8).

<>when Durva1sas visited the realm of Gods he presented
<>Devendra with a garland made of flowers of exquisite
<>fragrance. Indra tied it on to the tusk of Aira1vata (the
<>elephant of Indra). When the beetles which gathered
<>on the garland for honey became a nuisance, Aira1-
<>vata destroyed that garland. Durva1sas who got angry
<>at this cursed the gods as a whole that they would get
<>wrinkles and grey hair. The gods were advised by
<>Maha1vis2n2u that if they got Ambrosia (Amr2ta--celestial
<>honey) from the sea of Milk by churning it they could
<>escape from this. Accordingly the Gods called the
<>asuras for help, and they approached the sea of Milk.
<>They made use of the Mountain of Mandara as churn-
<>drill and the huge snake Va1suki as churning rope, and
<>the churning commenced. The gods took hold of the
<>tail of the snake and as the churning was proceeding
<>the churn-drill, the mountain of Mandara, having no
<>fixation at the bottom sank down. Then Maha1vis2n2u [Page081-a+ 65]
<>took the form of a turtle, and got under the Mandara
<>mountain and lifted it up on his back. By the force of
<>lifting it went higher and higher up. Then Maha1vis2n2u took
<>the form of an eagle and sat on the top of the mountain
<>and it came down a little and placed itself in the right
<>position. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 7; Agni

<>that period when hermit Kas4yapa was carrying on
<>his evening prayer and devotional rites, his wife Diti
<>approached him with lustful desire. Kas4yapa told her
<>that as he was engaged in prayer and meditation it
<>was not proper on her part to select that particular
<>moment for her lustful desire. But she persisted and
<>the sage yielded and out of that union two sons were
<>born. They are the two asuras Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu. Of these Hiran2ya1ks2a was the incarnation of
<>Jaya and Hiran2yakas4ipu that of Vijaya.
<F>*) During their next birth they made their appearance as Ra1vnca and Kumbhakarn2a and during the third birth they were S4is4upa1la and
<>Dan2d2avaktra.</F> With the
<>birth of these two the whole world began to tremble.
<>These two asura brothers began to terrorize the world.
<>They wandered about causing destruction and devasta-
<>tion wherever they went. Once Hiran2ya1ks2a got down
<>into the ocean and began to beat the waves in the
<>ocean with his cudgel. The ocean began to sway and
<>surge. Varun2a (the Lord of water) was terrified and
<>he ran to Maha1vis2n2u and sought protection. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u took the form of a Pig and came to the ocean.
<>When Hiran2ya1ks2a saw Maha1vis2n2u he took the earth in
<>his hand and ran to Pa1ta1la (the nether world). Maha1-
<>vis2n2u followed him and killed him and recovered the
<>earth. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 3, Chapter 18; Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 2, Chapter 7 and Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 4).
<NI>4) {%Narasim3ha1vata1ra. (Incarnation as lion-man).%} With the
<>death of Hiran2ya1ks2a, his brother Hiran2yakas4ipu became
<>furious more than ever. He wanted to avenge the death
<>of his brother. His fury was turned towards Maha1vis2n2u.
<>So he got on the top of the Mountain of Mandara and
<>did penance before Brahma1 and Brahma1 appeared and
<>granted him boons, one of which was that nobody but
<>Vis2n2u should be able to kill him. He returned with
<>gladness and began to roam about torturing devotees
<>of Vis2n2u everywhere.
<NI>A son named Prahla1da was born to him. He was a god-
<>fearing child and from birth an ardent believer in Vis2n2u.
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu tried his utmost to change his son to a
<>hater of Vis2n2u. He got a special teacher for the
<>purpose and Prahla1da was taken to the house of the
<>teacher to live with him until he changed his mind. The
<>result was that the teacher and all others who advised
<>him ultimately became believers in Vis2n2u. Anger over-
<>powered Hiran2yakas4ipu. Prahla1da was thrown before
<>mad elephants. But the tusks of the elephant missed the
<>aim and were driven into the earth and broken. Veno-
<>mous snakes were employed and those which bit him had
<>their fangs broken. Finally the child was put in blazing [Page081-b+ 63]
<>fire. But the child felt the fire to be cool and soothing.
<>From that fire a ghost arose and tried to kill Prahla1da.
<>Instantly the Sudars4ana, the wheel-weapon of Vis2n2u
<>came down and cut off the head of the ghost. Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu jumped with anger and called out. “Where
<>is your Vis2n2u?” His son replied that his Vis2n2u dwelt
<>in every movable and immovable thing. Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>kicked at a stone pillar close by and asked him, “Is
<>your Vis2n2u in this pillar?” Prahla1da replied, “My Vis2n2u
<>is in Pillar and in fibre”. Before he had finished, the
<>Pillar broke open and a monster as horrible as the
<>Destroyer S4iva, in the shape of a lion-man made its
<>appearance.

<NI>This was the figure of Narasim3ha. Mr. S. Paramesvara
<>Iyer, Ulloor, has described this figure in his “Bhakti-

<NI>“Glaring eyes burning as blazing cinder, tongue as a

<>human shape beyond the neck.” (Bhaktidi1pika1)
<NI>The horrid monster caught hold of Hiran2yakas4ipu the
<>King of the Asuras, pushed him to the ground and
<>opened his heart with its fierce claws. Blood sprouted
<>like a spring. With great ferocity he pulled out the in-

<>songs of praise and chanting of hymns of adoration
<>pacified the stormy Narasim3ha and bowed low down

<NI>5) {%Va1mana1vata1ra. (Incarnation as a Dwarf).%} It was to ex-
<>pel the Emperor Maha1bali, that Maha1vis2n2u incarnat-
<>ed as a dwarf. To Kas4yapa, the son of Mari1ci and
<>the grandson of Brahma1, was born of Diti, Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu. And from Prahla1da the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>was born Virocana and Bali was the son of Virocana.
<>Bali got the name Maha1bali because of his prowess.
<>He was the emperor of the Asuras. A fierce battle
<>began over the Ambrosia got from churning the sea
<>of Milk, between the Asuras and the gods. In the battle
<>Indra cut Maha1bali down with his Vajra1yudha. The
<>Asuras took the body of Maha1bali to Pa1ta1la (the
<>nether world) where their teacher S4ukra brought him to
<>life again. Then Maha1bali worshipped the Bha1rgavas
<>and became more powerful than before and went to
<>heaven again and renewed the battle. This time he
<>defeated the Gods altogether and subjugated the realm
<>of the Gods who were scattered to all sides. The devas
<>or gods are the sons of Kas4yapa born by his wife, Aditi.
<>She felt very sorry at the defeat of the gods. Seeing that
<>she was silent and sad Kas4yapa asked her the reason.
<>She replied that she was thinking of ways to enable the
<>gods to recover their lost power and position. Kas4yapa
<>advised her to please Maha1vis2n2u by observing Dva1-
<>das4i1 vrata (fast of the twelfth lunar night). Aditi did
<>so and Vis2n2u appeared before her and asked her what
<>she desired. Her request was that Vis2n2u should take
<>birth in her womb and recover Indra to his lost power
<>and position. Thus Vis2n2u took birth as the younger
<>brother of Indra in the shape of Va1mana (dwarf.)
<NI>At this time Emperor Maha1bali was celebrating a sacri-
<>fice on the bank of the River Narmada1 after having
<>subjugated the whole of the world. A large number of
<>hermits gathered there. Va1mana also was among them.
<>He requested Maha1bali to grant him three feet of
<>ground as alms. The teacher S4ukra warned Maha1bali
<>against granting the request. But the emperor granted
<>the request and asked Va1mana to measure the ground.
<>Va1mana immediately enlarged his body and measured
<>the heaven, the earth and the Pa1ta1la (the upper realm,
<>the earth and the lower realm) in two steps and asked
<>for place for the third step. The honest Maha1bali
<>showed his head and requested to complete the three
<>steps. Va1mana put his step on the head of Maha1bali and
<>pushed him down to Pa1ta1la. Thus the gods regained
<>their lost places. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 19).
<>A description that by the toe of Va1manas' raised foot
<>(raised for measuring the third step) the testicle of
<>Brahma1 was cut open where from the Ganges originated,
<>is seen in the Bha1gavata, Skandha 5.
<NI>When Vis4va1mitra took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to the
<>forest they entered a holy hermitage and Vis4va1mitra
<>told the boys that it was the hermitage where Aditi,

<>place that Va1mana incarnated and placed his step on
<>the head of Maha1bali.
<NI>“The bright Ma1dhava took birth in Aditi as Va1mana
<>and went to Maha1bali, requested for three feet of ground
<>and brought under control the three worlds for the good

<>Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna pleased the hermit-sage Datta1treya [Page082-b+ 63]
<>the son of Atri, by doing penance and got the boon of
<>one thousand hands. One day he went to the forest for
<>hunting and entered the bank of Narmada1. The hermit
<>Jamadagni had been living there with his wife Ren2uka1
<>and sons Paras4ura1ma and others. The King being tired
<>of hunting got into the hermitage. Paras4ura1ma was not
<>there. The hermit called his divine cow Ka1madhenu,
<>which provided the King and his followers with a very
<>good supper.
<NI>When the King departed he asked for the wonderful
<>cow. The hermit did not consent. The King caught
<>hold of the cow by force and went to his city. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma went to Ma1his2mati1nagar the capital of Ka1rtta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna, killed the King and took Ka1madhenu back.
<>From that day onwards the sons of Ka1rttavi1rya were
<>waiting for an opportunity to take revenge.
<NI>Once Ren2uka1 went to the river to bring water. A gan-
<>dharva (semi god) named Citraratha was bathing in
<>the river. She happened to look at him for a little while.
<>When she returned the hermit was very angry and asked
<>each of his sons to cut off the head of their mother. They
<>all refused. But Paras4ura1ma immediately obeyed his
<>father and cut off her head. His father was pleased and
<>said that he might ask any boon. He requested his father
<>to bring his mother back to life. Accordingly Ren2uka1
<>was brought back to life.
<NI>Once the sons of Ka1rttavi1rya got into the hermitage,
<>at a time when Paras4ura1ma was away and cut off the
<>head of the hermit Jamadagni and took it off. When he
<>returned his mother told him how his father was killed.
<>She cried and beat her breast twentyone times. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma became an incarnation of revenge, and travelled
<>over the world twentyone times and killed every Ks2at-
<>riya King. The blood of all those Kings flowed into one
<>channel and gathered in a holy Bath called Syamanta-
<>pan5cakam3. Thus Maha1vis2n2u took his sixth incarna-
<>tion as Paras4ura1ma and fulfilled his duty of destroying
<>the wicked Ks2atriya Kings (For details about Paras4u-
<>ra1ma see under Paras4ura1ma and Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna).

<>only will be acceptable. People would become irrespon-
<>sible wearing the garment of duty. Lawless people
<>would take the form of Kings and will begin to eat

<>the son of Vis2n2uyas4as and the priest of Ya1jn5avalkya and

<>brought back to the four classes and the four a1s4ramas
<>or stages of life and the doctrines and directions of the

<>took the form of Su1kara (Pig). To show the world the
<>tattva (essence) of Sat (good) and tama (darkness)
<>He took the form of hermit Na1rada. To show the merits
<>of penance He became Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. To impart
<>to the world the meaning of Sa1m3khya Yoga (Indian
<>Philosophy dealing with evolution and union with the
<>Supreme Spirit) He came as Kapila the learned. To
<>teach the world the laws of chastisement He was
<>born as Datta of the wife of Atri. Then He came as
<>Yajn5a to become Indra. The next incarnation He took
<>was R2s2abha, the noble King. To shorten and flatten
<>the earth He came as Pr2thu. To recover the Vedas he
<>took the form of Matsya (fish). To remove wrinkles and
<>grey hair the gods had churned the sea of Milk and
<>then to lift the mount Mandara He went under it and
<>as a bird He got up on it. To give the world A1yurveda
<>(the scripture of medicine) He came as Dhanvantari.
<>To entice Asuras and to recover Ambrosia from them
<>He took the form of Mohini1. To save the devoted
<>Prahla1da and to slay his father He came in the form of

<>hell meant for those who stand false witness, who take
<>false oath and false name. The soldiers of Yama will
<>push these false people into the hell of Avi1ci, from the
<>top of a mount which is a hundred yojanas (league) high.
<>The place of Avi1ci, like the waves of the ocean, is swell-

<HI>AVIJN5A1TAGATI. Two sons were born to Anila, a vasu
<>by his wife S4iva1. They were called Avijn5a1tagati and
<>Manojava. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 25).
<HI>AVIKAMPANA. This ancient King got from the her-
<>mit Jyes2t2ha Sa1tvatadharma (righteousness). (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 384, Stanza 47).
<HI>AVIKS2IT I. A famous King. The son of Karandhama
<>and father of Marutta. He was honoured even by
<>Br2haspati, having performed a hundred horse sacrifices.
<>Mention is made in the Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a that Aviks2it
<>had seven wives: Vara1, Gauri1, Subhadra1, Li1la1vati1,
<>Vibha1, Man3gavati1, and Kumudvati1. Besides them Vai-
<>s4a1lini1 the princess of Vis4a1la1 also was his wife. He had
<>taken this Vais4a1lini1 from her Svayam3vara dais (the
<>bride herself selecting a husband from those who are
<>present), defeating the Kings who were present
<>there. Those defeated Kings, later, joined together and
<>defeated Aviks2it and took him a prisoner. Finally Kara-
<>ndhama rescued him. His greatness is described as
<>follows:
<NI>“The righteous man Aviks2it is equal to Indra in pro-
<>wess. This austere and righteous man has become a
<>great sacrificer. In brightness he is equal to the
<>Sun, as forgiving as the earth, in intelligence equal
<>to Br2haspati and as firm as the Hima1layas. By his
<>thought, word, and deed and self control and noble
<>actions he kept his subjects in peace and prosperity.”
<>(Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 4, Stanzas
<>19-21).

<>wife Va1hini1. Aviks2it was one of them. [See the word
<>Vam3s4a1vali1 (Genealogy)].
<HI>AVIMUKTA(M). The middle part of the city of Ka1s4i1.
<>There is a holy temple here. It is said that those who

<>to Ra1ma.
<NI>“The aged giant and noble leader Avindhya, who had
<>earned the confidence of Ra1van2a, brave, learned and of

<>words.”
<NI>(S4ri1 Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 37,

<>“The famous giant leader, the noble aged well-wisher
<>of Ra1ma, Avindhya, had told me about you.”
<NI>“(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Stanza 56). There is a situa-
<>tion in Vana Parva when this noble giant prevented
<>Ra1van2a from his attempt to kill Si1ta1.
<NI>“When he saw the decision of Ra1van2a to kill Si1ta1,
<>Avandhya pacified Ra1van2a” and said, “you, a great King
<>of a great kingdom should not deteriorate to the level
<>of killing a woman. A woman who is in prison and at
<>your disposal is as good as dead. But in my opinion, even
<>if you cut her body into pieces she would not die and
<>if she must die you will have to kill her husband.”
<>(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 289, Stanzas 28 to 30).
<NI>From this statement the wonderful intelligence of
<>Avindhya could be understood. It is seen in stanzas 6
<>and 7 of Chapter 291 of M.B., Vana Parva that it was
<>Avindhya who had taken Si1ta1 before S4ri1 Ra1ma when

<HI>AYODHADHAUMYA (A1yodhadhaumya). A1poda-
<>dhaumya, Apodadhaumya, Dhaumya. A great Muni
<>(sage). He had three disciples, A1run2i, Upamanyu and
<>Veda.
<NI>1) {%Disciple A1run2i.%} He belonged to Pa1n5ca1la, and once his
<>guru deputed him to construct embankments in the
<>field. But, his attempts to construct embankments
<>did not succeed. Finally he lay himself in the field
<>where the embankment was required, and then the
<>flow of water stopped. The guru enquired about A1run2i,
<>who was thus lying in the field. Then only he knew
<>the reason for A1run2i's absence. The guru went to the
<>field and called A1run2i. Then the embankment burst [Page084-b+ 65]
<>open and A1run2i came out, and because of that A1run2i
<>got the name Udda1laka. (M.B., Chapter 3, Verses
<>21-33).
<NI>2) {%Disciple Upamanyu.%} Once Dhaumya (the guru) asked
<>his second disciple Upamanyu to tend the cows. He
<>used to take care of the animals grazing in the woods

<>body of Upamanyu the guru asked him how he was
<>feeding himself. His reply was that he was begging
<>alms and feeding himself with what he got thus. Then
<>the guru asked him to hand over to him (guru) all
<>alms got in future. After that he used to give everything
<>he got by way of alms to the guru. And, he continued
<>returning to the Gurukula at dusk and prostrating be-
<>fore the guru. Finding Upamanyu even then as plump
<>and healthy as he was formerly, the guru said: My
<>son Upamanyu, you hand over to me all the alms you
<>get, and yet your body looks as trim as of old. How
<>happens it so?” Upamanyu replied: “After giving the
<>alms I get first to you, my guru, I do again beg for
<>alms and feed myself”. To this the guru reacted thus:
<>My boy, what you do is not the proper thing. By the
<>second course of alms-taking you stand in the way of
<>other people getting their food. It is gross injustice to
<>do so.”
<NI>Upamanyu, from that day onwards strictly followed
<>his guru's instruction, and continued returning at dusk
<>to the guru and doing obeisance to him.
<NI>Even then finding Upamanyu to be quite plump and
<>healthy the guru told him: “Well, now you hand over
<>to me all the alms you get, and you do not take alms
<>a second time the same day. Yet you are quite fit and
<>fat. How is it so?”
<NI>To this Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding him-
<>self on the milk of the cows he tended. The guru told
<>him that this too was not just and proper on his part.
<>The guru had not permitted him to drink milk thus.
<NI>Upamanyu agreed to obey his orders. And, as usual he
<>continued tending the cows and returning at dusk. Even
<>then he maintained the same plump and healthy phy-
<>sique. And the Guru told him as follows: “You do not
<>eat the food you get at the first alms-taking, you do not
<>go in for alms a second time the same day, nor do you
<>drink milk. Yet, how is it that you maintain the same
<>fat and healthy physique as in former days?”
<NI>Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding now-a-days
<>on the foam of milk bristling at the mouth of the
<>calves when they had fed on their mother's milk. And,
<>the guru said: “if that is so the calves will be, out of
<>kindness and sympathy for you, releasing much foam
<>of milk out of their mouths. That will affect them. So,
<>do not repeat the process. Since the guru forbade him
<>to have food in any manner as detailed above, Upa-
<>manyu, while tending the herd of cows in the forest, ate
<>the bitter and poisonous leaves of a tree one day to
<>satisfy his burning hunger. The leaf was bitter in taste
<>and injurious in its properties. Therefore, this new way
<>of satisfying hunger affected the health of the eyes of
<>Upamanyu and he became blind. Moving about in this
<>condition he fell into a neglected well in the woods.
<NI>When, even after the sun had set, Upamanyu did not,
<>as usual, return, the guru enquired about him from
<>other disciples. Naturally, they told the guru that
<>Upamanyu was out in the forest with the cows. As the [Page085-a+ 65]
<>guru felt that Upamanyu was staying away late in the
<>forest since he had been prevented from doing every-
<>thing he (guru) went to the forest accompanied by
<>other disciples and called out for Upamanyu, and
<>Upamanyu responded from deep down the well. He
<>also told the guru how he happened to fall into the well.
<>After telling him that if only he would pray to the
<>As4vini1devas they will cure his blindness the guru return-
<>ed to the A1s4rama with other disciples. Upamanyu,
<>accordingly offered praises and prayed to the As4vini1-
<>devas, who were so pleased with him that they appeared
<>before him and gave him a bread. Upamanyu refused
<>to eat the bread without giving it to the guru. Then
<>the As4vini1devas told him thus: “In the past when we
<>gave your guru a bread like this he ate the same with-
<>out giving it to his guru. You may just imitate him
<>and eat the bread yourself”. Even then Upamanyu did
<>not eat the bread. The As4vini1devas were so much
<>pleased at this that they blessed Upamanyu thus: “The
<>teeth of your guru will turn into hard iron and yours
<>into pure gold. Your blindness will be cured and all
<>happiness and prosperity will be yours.”
<NI>The blessings of the As4vini1devas took full effect, and
<>Upamanyu hurried to his guru and prostrated at his
<>feet. Dhaumya and the other disciples of his congratu-
<>lated Upamanyu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 3, Verses
<>34-77).
<NI>3) {%Disciple, Veda.%} Ayodhadhaumya one day said to
<>Veda, his third disciple: “You stay with me for some-
<>time serving me. That will bring you all prosperity in
<>life.” Veda agreed, and stayed for a long time in the
<>A1s4rama in the service of the guru. Without even the
<>slightest murmur he put up with every discomfort and
<>hardship, be it acute hunger and thirst or extreme
<>cold or heat, and gladly performed all the work and
<>duties the master imposed on him. The guru was ab-
<>solutely pleased and his blessings resulted in all pros-
<>perity and omnipotence for the disciple. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 3, Verses 78-80).
<HI>AYODHYA1. A city in North India which enjoyed great
<>importance and reputation for many years as the capi-
<>tal of the Kings of the solar dynasty. (See Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty). All the Kings of this dynasty ruled the coun-
<>try from this city as their capital. Vasis2t2ha, the great
<>preceptor of the Iks2va1ku Ra1jas, came to Ayodhya1 dur-
<>ing the period of the reign of Kalma1s2apa1da, who was
<>the thirtyfifth ruler in succession to Iks2va1ku. A quarrel
<>broke out between Kalma1s2apa1da and Vasis2t2ha during
<>a hunting expedition, and Vasis2t2ha cursed the King
<>and as the result the latter became a Ra1ks2asa. After
<>regaining his former form as King, he apologised to
<>Vasis2t2ha and they became friends again. At the requ-
<>est of the King in the interests of his dynasty Vasis2t2ha
<>came to Ayodhya1, and the people were greatly elated.
<>A son was born to Vasis2t2ha by Kalma1s2apa1da's wife and
<>that son was As4maka. After that Vasis2t2ha used to go to
<>Ayodhya1 frequently and was installed as family precep-
<>tor of the Iks2va1kus. Till the time of S4ri1 Ra1ma the city
<>of Ayodhya1 maintained its pomp and glory, and after
<>that gradually its decay and fall set in. Laudatory refe-
<>rences to the city are found in most of the Pura1n2as
<>like the Maha1bha1rata, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a etc. (See
<>Kosala).
<HI>AYOMUKHI1. A Ra1ks2asa woman. She met S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a on their way to Matam3ga1s4rama in [Page085-b+ 65]
<>search of Si1ta1, and requested Laks2man2a to marry her.
<>Laks2man2a, as in the case of S4u1rpan2akha1 cut off her
<>nose and breasts and drove her away. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 69).
<HI>AYUTANA1YI. A king of the Pu1ru Vam3s4a; he was the
<>son of Maha1ra1ja Bhauma. Suyajn5a1, Ka1ma1 and Akro-
<>dha were the names respectively of his mother, wife
<>and son. He came to be known as Ayutana1yi because
<>of his having performed 10,000 Purus2amedhas. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verses 19-20)
<HI>AYUTA1YU. A king who ruled his state for 1000 years.
<>The Pura1n2as like Bha1gavata, the Matsya and the Va1yu
<>refer to him as the son of S4rutas4ravas.
<HI>AYUTA1YUS. Father of King R2tuparn2a. (Bha1gavata,
<>Navama Skandha). For genealogy see Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<HI>A1. ({#A#}) This word means Brahma1 and also ana1dara-
<>va1kya (a word showing disrespect). In the indeclinable
<>form it means limit, anger and pain.
<HI>A1BHI1RAS.
<NI>{%A few details:%} 1) A low-caste people. People living in
<>the estuary of the rivers of Sindhu1 and Sarasvati1 were
<>generally called A1bhi1ras. In the Sabha1 Parva of Maha1-
<>bha1rata we find Nakula defeating these people during
<>his victory march after the great Maha1bha1rata battle.
<NI>2) Once A1bhi1ras went to Dharmaputra with many
<>gifts. (S4lokas 11-13, Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) Once it was prophesied by Ma1rkan2d2eya R2s2i, that
<>low-caste people like A1bhi1ras and S4akas would become
<>rulers of states in different parts of Bha1rata during
<>Kaliyuga. (S4lokas 35-36, Chapter 188, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>4) In the Garud2avyu1ha (Battle array named after
<>Garud2a) which Dron2a created during the Kuruks2etra
<>battle he included A1bhi1ras also. (S4loka 6, Chapter 20,
<>Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) Because of the hatred of S4u1dras and A1bhi1ras a sac-
<>red lake named Vina1s4ana disappeared from the river,
<>Sarasvati1. (S4lokas 1 and 2, Chapter 37, S4alya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>6) A1bhi1ras were Ks2atriyas formerly. Afraid of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma they fled and lived in mountain-caves not conti-
<>nuing their hereditary work and thus became S4u1dras.
<>(S4loka 16, Chapter 29, As4vamedhika Parva, M.B.).
<NI>7) When Dva1raka1 was destroyed by floods and all the
<>Ya1davas were killed Arjuna went north taking along with
<>him the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. At that time A1bhi1ras were
<>among those who attacked and carried away the
<>women. (S4lokas 47-63, Chapter 7, Mausalya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>A1CAMANA. First drink water three times accompanied
<>by incantations and then with water wipe your face
<>twice and your eyes, ears, nose, shoulders, breast and
<>head once. This act is called A1camana.

<>Kha1ni caiva spr2s4edabhir
<>A1tma1nam3 s4ira eva ca”</Poem>
<>(Manusmr2ti, S4loka 60, Chapter 2).
<NI>Devi1 Bha1gavata in its eleventh Skandha says about
<>A1camana like this: “Drinking water by your right hand
<>is called a1camana. Curve your palm into the shape of
<>a spoon, hold water in it and drink. There must be
<>enough water in the palm to cover a green-gram seed,
<>not less nor more. If it falls short or exceeds the mea-
<>sure it is considered to be like drinking alcohol. While [Page086-a+ 65]
<>shaping your palm neither your little finger nor your
<>thumb should touch the other fingers. At the time of
<>a1camana you should support your right hand by your
<>left hand. Otherwise the water will turn impure.”
<HI>A1CA1RAMARYA1DAS. See under Pu1ja1vidhi.
<HI>A1D2AMBARA. One of the five Pa1rs2adas whom Brahma1
<>gave to Skandadeva. Brahma1 gave Kunda, Kusuma,

<HI>A1D2I. A mighty son of the demon, Andhaka1sura. He did
<>penance to please Brahma1 and obtained from him a
<>boon to seek vengeance on S4iva who had murdered his
<>father. The boon was that A1d2i would die only when he
<>left his present form and took another form. After
<>obtaining the boon A1d2i went to Kaila1sa and outwitting
<>the sentries entered the abode of S4iva in the shape of a
<>serpent. After that he disguised himself as Pa1rvati1 and
<>went near S4iva. But S4iva knew the trick and killed him.
<>(Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a of Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1D2I1BAKA. A combat without serving any useful pur-
<>pose and conducted out of sheer spite between two
<>people to the surprise of others. The fight between
<>Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra was of this king. (Skandha 6
<>of Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1DIGADA1DHARA. It was with the bones of an asura
<>(demon) named Gada that Maha1vis2n2u made the first
<>gada1 (mace). By that mace Vis2n2u killed Heti and other
<>asuras of that lot and got the name A1digada1dhara (He
<>who first handled the mace). (See under Gada1).
<HI>A1DIKU1RMA. The mountain of Mandara which was
<>used as a churn-stick to churn the great milky ocean,
<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi went down the ocean. Then Maha1vis2n2u
<>took the shape of a tortoise to lift it up and this first
<>tortoise was called A1diku1rma. (S4loka 12, Chapter 18,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1DIPARVA. One of the parvans of the epic Maha1bha1rata.
<>It is the first parva. (See under Bha1rata).
<HI>A1DIPARVATA. The place of abode of S4iva in the

<HI>A1DIRA1JA. The son of Kuru who was a king of the
<>Pu1ru dynasty. (See under Pu1ru).
<HI>A1DIS4IS4IRA. One of the disciples of S4a1kalya. Vya1sa
<>made the Vedas and taught his son S4a1kalya a portion
<>of it. S4a1kalya divided his portion into five different
<>and equal divisions and taught each of his five disciples,
<>Va1tsya1yana, Maudgalya, S4a1li, A1dis4is4ira and Gokhali a
<>division. (Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1DIS2T2I. The disciple who was ordained by his precep-
<>tor to observe celibacy for a stipulated number of years.
<HI>A1DITYA. The twelve sons born to the sage Kas4yapa of
<>his wife Aditi are known as the twelve A1dityas. They
<>are the following: Dha1ta1, Mitra, Aryama1, Rudra,
<>Varun2a, Su1rya, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1, Savita1, Tvas2t2a1
<>and Vis2n2u. Besides these Aditi had twentyone children
<>including Indra. All of them are called A1dityas mean-
<>ing children of Aditi. From the thirtythree sons of Aditi
<>were born the thirtythree crores of devata1s. Of these
<>the eldest is Indra and the youngest, Va1mana. (S4loka
<>36, Chapter 66, A1di Parva, M.B.). (There is corrobora-
<>tion for this in S4loka 14, Sarga 14, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>Sirdar K.M. Panikar in his preface to the book “R2gveda-
<>sam3hita1” writes thus about A1dityas: “Generally we
<>think of Su1rya (the Sun) when we hear the word
<>A1ditya. But there are many different A1dityas in R2g-
<>veda, chief of them is Varun2a. Though Savita1, Pu1s2a1 [Page086-b+ 64]
<>and Mitra are all synonyms of Su1rya in R2gveda they
<>are all separate devas. There is no end to the varieties
<>of A1dityas and their prominence in the Vedas. Sum-
<>marising we can say thus. The familiar devas like
<>Indra, Agni, Varun2a and Su1rya are not found in the
<>same form or power as we are taught to believe. Those
<>whom we have lowered down to the posts of the eight
<>sentries of the universe are very prominent devata1s in
<>the Vedas. Many A1dityas have merged in Su1rya and
<>winds in the god of Va1yu. Rudra has merged in S4iva.
<>Who will believe that the all-powerful Deva of the R2g-
<>veda and the vainglorious Indra who lives in fear of
<>men doing penance are one and the same person?”
<HI>A1DITYAHR2DAYA. A mantra (incantation) of great
<>power to destroy all enemies. During the combat with
<>Ra1van2a at one time Ra1ma fell exhausted in the battle-
<>field. Seeing this the sage Agastya rushed to him and
<>taught him this mantra. (Sarga 107, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>A1DITYAKETU. One of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Bhi1ma

<>ter 88, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1DITYASENA. A very brave King. Stories about this

<HI>A1GNEYA1STRA. A powerful weapon or missile. One
<>night Arjuna fought against a gandharva, An3ga1raparn2a,
<>on the banks of the river Ganges. Arjuna then described
<>to him how he came into possession of this missile. This
<>powerful missile was given first to Bha1radva1ja by Br2has-
<>pati and Bharadva1ja gave it to Agnives4ya who in turn
<>gave it to Dron2a and the latter gave it to Arjuna, his
<>most favourite disciple. (S4lokas 29-30, Chapter 170, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1GNEYI1. Wife of Kuru, son of Manu. S4ambhu wife of
<>Dhruva gave birth to two sons, S4is2t2i and Bhavya.
<>Succha1ya1 wife of S4is2t2i1 gave birth to five sinless sons
<>Ripu, Ripum3jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2katejas. Ca1k-
<>s2us2a was born of Br2hati1, wife of Ripu. Manu was born
<>to Ca1ks2us2a of his wife Pus2karin2i1, daughter of the great
<>Vi1ran2apraja1pati. Pus2karin2i1 hailed from the dynasty of
<>Marutta. To Manu were born of Nad2vala1 ten sons,
<>Kuru, Puru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci,
<>Agnis2t2oma, Atira1tra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. Of
<>these, Kuru got of his wife A1gneyi1 six sons: An3ga,

<>that A1huka and Ugrasena were the names of the same
<>person). For genealogy, see “YADU VAM3S4A”. In M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33, we find that

<>times. I will eat meat and any kind of food. I will lie on
<>soft bed or on bare earth sometimes and in big houses
<>if I get the chance. I will wear costly clothes if I get
<>them or I will wear dried leaves and animal skins. If
<>I get food from ya1gas4a1la1s I will never refuse it, but I
<>will never go seeking for it.” (S4lokas 19-25, Chapter
<>179, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).

<>Elephants were born as the sons of Ma1tan3gi1. (Sarga 14,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.).
<NI>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata to explain why the
<>tongue of the elephant is curved inside. “Bhr2gu Mahars2i
<>cursed Agni and greatly dejected over this he dis-
<>appeared from public and hid somewhere. The Devas
<>started searching for him and it was an elephant that
<>showed the devas the hiding place of Agni. Agni then
<>cursed the elephants and said that thereafter all the
<>elephants would have their tongues curved inside. (S4loka
<>36, Chapter 85, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>The signs of good elephants and the treatment to be
<>accorded to sick ones are detailed in Agni Pura1n2a.
<>“Elephants with long trunks and heavy breathing be-
<>long to the top class and they will possess great endu-
<>rance power. Those who have nails eighteen or twenty
<>in number and who became turbulent during winter
<>belong to a superior class. Those ones whose right
<>tusks are a bit raised, whose cry is stentorian as that of
<>thunder whose ears are very big and whose skins are
<>spotted are the best of the species. Other varieties espe-
<>cially the dwarfish type and she-elephants in the early
<>stage of pregnancy are not good and not fit to be tamed.
<>Elephants who have Varn2a, Sattva, Bala, Ru1pa, Ka1nti,
<>S4ari1ragun2a and Vega will conquer enemies in a battle;
<>there is no doubt about it. Elephants are an ornament [Page088-a+ 38]
<>for any battle-array. The victory earned by a King with
<>his elephants is more respected.
<NI>For all diseases of an elephant Anuva1sana or Sneha-
<>vasti is recommended. A bath after anointing it with
<>oil or ghee is good. For skin diseases the ghee may be
<>combined with Man5jal (Turmeric), Maraman5jal or
<>gomu1tra (cow urine). If it suffers from enlargement
<>of the belly, giving it a bath with sesame oil is good.
<>It can be given Pan5calavan2as and Va1run2i1madya to
<>drink. If there is fainting it must be given rice mixed
<>with Vlalari, Triphala, Cukku, Mulaku and Tippali
<>and water mixed with honey to drink. If there is head-
<>ache anointing the head with sesame oil and inhala-
<>tion of the same is good.
<NI>For diseases of the foot, treatment with Snehaput2as is
<>prescribed. To get motion of the bowels Kalkan2t2a
<>Kas2a1ya (infusion of sugar candy) is good. To those who
<>have shivers should be given the flesh of peacock,
<>Tittiri bird and La1va bird mixed with Tippali and pep-
<>per. For dysentery the tender fruit of Ku1vala, skin of
<>Pa1ccotti, flower of Ta1tiri should be dried and powder-
<>ed and be given mixed with sugar along with rice. For
<>Karagraha (pain inside the trunk) Nasyam of ghee with
<>I1ntappu1 mixed in it should be done. It must be given
<>“Muttan3ga Kan5ci with tippali, Cukku and Ji1raka in
<>it. For Utkarn2aka (pain in the ear) flesh of pigs should
<>be given. For Galagraha (pain in the neck) a liniment
<>made of Das4amu1la, Mutirappuli and Ka1kkappancci in
<>oil should be rubbed at the site of pain and the elephant
<>kept under chains. If there is difficulty in passing urine
<>light liquor containing powdered As2t2alavan2as should
<>be given. For all skin diseases use Vep oil as an oint-
<>ment and give the infusion of A1t2alot2aka to drink. For
<>worms (inside the stomach) give cow's urine with pow-
<>dered Vla1lari in it. If the elephant is getting reduced
<>and weak it should be given milk or meat soup with Cuk-
<>ku, Tippali and grapes well mixed in it. If there is lack
<>of appetite it is to be given Mulgaudana (rice boiled [Page088-b+ 79]
<>along with Cerupayar) to which is added Cukku, Mulaku
<>and Tippali. If it is Gulma it should be given sesame
<>oil boiled with the following: Trikotpakkonna, Cukku,
<>Mulaku Tippali, Kotuvelikkilan3gu, Na1gadantiveru,
<>Erikkinveru, Na1tkkotpakkonna, Milk and Attittippali.
<>Navara rice with sort of cerupayar can also be given.
<>For swellings on the face, a paste made of tender
<>Ku1vala fruits can be rubbed at the site of the swelling.
<>For all sorts of pains in the stomach rice well mixed
<>with the powder made by grinding together Vla1lari,
<>Kut2akappa1layari, Asafoetida, Carala, Man5jal, Mara-
<>man5jal may be given.
<NI>The best food for elephants is the rice of Navara, Vri1hi
<>and cennellu. Yava and wheat are next to the above.
<>Any other food is inferior to these. Yava and sugarcane
<>will give strength to elephants. Dry yava rice is not
<>good. Milk and meat cooked with carminative ingre-
<>dients are good for elephants who have gone lean.
<NI>If the elephants receive great injuries in a battle the
<>meat of birds like crow, fowl, cuckoo and Hari mixed
<>with honey is good. Fumigation by the burning of
<>chilli, fish, Vla1lari, caustic soda, Puttal, Pi1ram and
<>maraman5jal mixed together is effective. Dropping
<>honey medicated with tippali tandula, sesame oil, and
<>fruit honey in the eyes is not only good for the eyes but
<>is also inducive of digestion. Make an ointment with
<>the faces of the birds ca1taka and Pa1ra1vata mixed with
<>the burnt skin of Na1tpa1mara dissolved in light spirit.
<>If this ointment is applied, the elephant would defeat
<>all enemies in a battle. Powder Ni1lotpala, Muttan3ga
<>and Takara and make an ointment using rice gruel.
<>Applying this ointment in the eye is excellent.
<NI>If the nails grow they should be cut at least once a
<>month. Once in a month an oil bath is good for the
<>elephants. Elephant sheds should be spread with cow-
<>dung discs and dust. Doing Seka with ghee during
<>autumn and summer is advisable. (Chapter 287, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).

<HI>A1NAKADUNDUBHI. An epithet of Vasudeva, father
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<HI>A1NANDA. A forest on the top of the mountain Maha1-
<>meru. It was inhabited by celestial damsels, devas,
<>gandharvas and Mahars2is. (Chapter 93, Bhu1mi
<>Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1NANDA (CA1KS2US2A). Son of Mahars2i Anamitra. It
<>was he who was born as Ca1ks2us2a, the sixth Manu.
<>There is a story behind his birth. One day, while his
<>mother was keeping him in her lap and caressing him
<>the baby laughed and questioned “Oh mother why are
<>you caressing me, but look at those two cats. They
<>consider me as their food”. After some time one of the
<>cats took the child away and put it in the cradle of the
<>child of King Vikra1nta. Vikra1nta took the child as his
<>for granted and reared him. At the time of Upanayana
<>the King asked the boy to prostrate before his mother at
<>which the boy exclaimed “Oh King, I am not your son.
<>Your son is at some other place. By births and rebirths
<>all of us have many mothers and so it is better to be
<>above rebirths”. After having said so much A1nanda
<>went to the forest and started doing penance. Brahma1
<>appeared before him and blessing him said that he
<>would become the sixth Manu and lead the world to
<>righteousness. By the blessing of Brahma1 A1nanda was
<>reborn as Ca1ks2us2amanu. (See under Ca1ks2us2a). (Ma1r-
<>kan2d2eya Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1NANDAVARDHANA. A great critic of Sanskrit litera-
<>ture. He lived in the 9th century A.D. He expounded
<>his theory of Dhvaniva1da by 120 Ka1rika1s. His own
<>commentary of the Ka1rika1s is the book called Dhvanya1-
<>loka. There are four parts for Dhvanya1loka and each
<>part is called an Udyota.
<NI>There is a belief among a few that the Ka1rika1s were
<>written by another scholar, Sahr2daya, and that A1nanda-
<>vardhana had written only a commentary on it. He
<>was a member of the royal council of Avantivarma1
<>who ruled Kashmi1r during the period 854-884 A.D.
<>It is believed that he wrote Dhvanya1loka in 850 A.D.
<>Many commentaries have been written of Dhvanya1loka
<>of which the one written by Abhinavagupta is consider-
<>ed to be the best.
<HI>A1NARTTA. Grandson of Vaivasvatamanu. He was a
<>king, son of S4arya1ti.
<NI>1. {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u-Brahma1-
<>Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Vivasva1n-Vaivasvatamanu-S4arya1ti-
<>A1nartta.
<NI>Sixteen sons were born to Vaivasvatamanu: Manu,
<>Yama, Yami1, As4vini1kuma1ra, Revanta, Sudyumna, Iks2-
<>va1ku, Nr2ga, S4arya1ti, Dis2t2a, Dhr2s2t2a, Karu1s2a, Naris2yanta,

<>two children, Sukanya1 and Anartta. Sukanya1 became
<>the wife of Cyavana.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%} It was this king who built the fortresses
<>at the town of Kus4asthali1 (Dva1raka1). Varun2a submerg- [Page089-b+ 55]
<>ed in the ocean all the fortresses built by him and the
<>place for some time remained as a forest-land. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata Kilippa1ttu). It was after that that
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a made that land beautiful and called it
<>Dva1raka1. The country ruled over by A1nartta was called
<>A1narttam. During his regime there lived in his land a
<>very great scholar named Vedaratha. (Umes4a1navrata,
<>S4iva Pura1n2a) See under Vedaratha.
<HI>A1NARTTA (M). A place in ancient Bha1rata. Arjuna
<>conquered this place. (S4loka 4, Chapter 26, Sabha1
<>Parva, M.B.).

<>13 and 14, Chapter 123, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1N3GIRASAKALPA. A sam3hita1 division of Atharva-
<>veda. The five sam3hita1 divisions of Atharvaveda
<>written by Mun5jikes4a are the best. They are: The
<>Naks2atra Kalpa dealing with the pu1ja1 rites of the
<>stars; The veda Kalpa dealing with the rites associated
<>with Brahma1, the R2tvik; The Sam3hita1 Kalpa, dealing
<>with the use and practice of Mantras; The A1n3girasa
<>Kalpa dealing with sorcery; and the S4a1nti Kalpa
<>dealing with matters relating to the welfare and
<>control of animals like horses and elephants. (Chapter 6,
<>Am3s4am 3 of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1N3GIRASI1. A very chaste wife of a Brahmin. By the
<>curse of S4akti, son of Vasis2t2ha Kalma1s2apa1da, a king of
<>the Iks2va1ku dynasty became a demon. That demon
<>killed and devoured the husband of A1n3girasi1. Enraged
<>at this the Brahmin lady cursed Kalma1s2apa1da saying
<>that if he touched his wife thereafter he would die.
<>That was why Vasis2t2ha had to beget a son for Kal-
<>ma1s2apa1da of his wife. (S4lokas 16-22, Chapter 181, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1N3GHRIKA. One of the sons of Vis4va1mitra who were
<>Brahmava1dins. (S4loka 54, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana

<>(Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1N5JANA KULA. A division of elephants (in the
<>army). (S4lokas 17 and 18, Chapter 112, Dron2a Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>A1NUS4A1SANIKA PARVA. One of the Parvans of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata’).
<HI>A1PA. One of the As2t2avasus. The As2t2avasus are A1pa,
<>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Agni, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. The sons of A1pa are Vaitan2d2a, S4rama, S4a1nta
<>and S4vani. (See under As2t2avasus). (Chapter 15, Am3s4am
<>1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1PAGA1. A sacred river. It is said that if one gives food
<>to one brahmin on the banks of this river it will be
<>equivalent to giving food to a crore of brahmins else-
<>where. (S4loka 68, Chapter 83, Vana Parva, M.B.). [Page090-a+ 64]
<HI>A1PASTAMBA. An ancient sage. He once consoled
<>King Dyumatsena. (S4loka 18, Chapter 298, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>1) {%How he got his name.%} Once a brahmin did not get
<>a suitable man toofficiate as priest for a s4ra1ddha cere-
<>mony. He then prayed to his ancestors, Vis4vedevas
<>and Maha1vis2n2u for help and then A1pastamba appeared
<>before him. The brahmin gave him food to his heart's
<>content and asked him how he felt. To the surprise of
<>the brahmin A1pastamba replied, he wanted some more
<>and thus made the S4ra1ddha ineffective. The brahmin
<>got angry and cursed him by sprinkling on his face
<>water taken in his palm. But before the water-particles
<>reached his face A1pastamba ordered the water-drops to
<>remain still. Water stopped stiff and still midway by
<>the power of the sage. Because water (A1pa) became
<>stiff (Stamba) the r2s2i was named A1pastamba. (Brahma
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%How A1pastamba ti1rtha came into existence.%} Once he met
<>Agastya Muni and asked him who was superior among
<>the gods Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva. Agastya declared
<>that S4iva stood supreme of the lot and gave him advice
<>as to how to please S4iva. Following his instructions
<>A1pastamba did penance on the banks of the river Gau-
<>tami1 and S4iva appeared before him, blessed him, and
<>made that place a holy one. S4iva declared that those
<>who, bathed at that place would obtain ‘Divyajn5a1na’
<>(Divine knowledge enabling one to know the past,
<>present and future). From then onwards that place
<>was known as A1pastamba ti1rtha.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} A1pastamba had a very chaste and
<>humble wife named Aks2asu1tra1. Their son was Ga1rki.
<>‘Gr2hyasu1trasam3graha’ containing a prayer and two man-
<>tras is a contribution to the holy science by A1pastamba.
<>Many Hindus follow it even now. He had stated
<>that the decrease in the number of great sages was
<>because of the fact that people were not practising the
<>control of the senses as before.
<HI>A1PADDHARMA PARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1PAVAN I. Another name of sage Vasis2t2ha. (S4loka 5,

<HI>A1PAVAN II. An ancient sage. Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna once
<>burnt the a1s4rama of this r2s2i and he cursed Agni and
<>Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna. (S4lokas 42 and 43, Chapter 49, S4a1nti
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1PODADHAUMYA. (See Ayodadhaumya).
<HI>A1PTA. A well-known serpent of the Kas4yapa dynasty.
<>(S4loka 8, Chapter 35, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1PU1RAN2A. A well-known serpent of the Kas4yapa dy-
<>nasty. (S4loka 6, Chapter 35, A1di Parva).
<HI>A1R. The significance of the number six among the an-
<>cients, is given below. (In Malaya1lam A1r means six).
<NI>1) {%Six factors which reduce the span of life.%} Eating dry
<>meat, Drinking curd at night, Sleeping at dawn,
<>Drinking impure water, Exposure to sun's heat in the

<HI>A1RS2A(M). A form of marriage. Bra1hma is the form of
<>marriage in which the bride is given to a man of good
<>ancestry and fine character. Marriage by giving the
<>bride after receiving a pair of cows from the bride-
<>groom is called A1rs2a. Pra1ja1patya is the form of marriage
<>in which the bride is given to the man who asks for
<>her. When the bride is given with dowry, the marriage
<>is known as A1suram. Marriage with the mutual love and
<>consent is Ga1ndharva. Capturing the bride after a fight
<>and marrying her by force is Ra1ks2asa. Marriage after
<>deceiving the bride is called Pais4a1ca. These are the
<>seven types of marriage. According to the author of the
<>Smr2ti another form of marriage known as DAIVA is
<>also mentioned. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 154).
<HI>A1RS2T2IS2EN2A. A Mahars2i. In the Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 159 there is a reference to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visiting this sage during their life in the forest. A1rs2t2i-
<>s2en2a's a1s4rama was midway between Badarya1s4rama and
<>Kubera's capital.
<NI>{%Power of Tapas.%} In Kr2tayuga this sage did rigorous
<>tapas in Pr2thu1dakati1rtha. Owing to the rigour of the
<>tapas he obtained all the chief vedas. He gave three
<>boons to that sacred ti1rtha:--
<NI>1. Those who bathe in this ti1rtha will get the benefit of
<>As4vamedha ya1ga.
<NI>2. There will be no fear of snakes in this ti1rtha.
<NI>3. A slight effort made here, will be rewarded with
<>greater results.
<NI>After giving these three boons to the river Sarasvati1
<>which is Pr2thu1dakati1rtha the sage attained Brahmin-
<>hood and entered Devaloka. (M.B., S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 40, Verses 3-9).
<HI>A1RTTA1YANI. S4alya, son of R2ta1yana. He was noted

<>against Arjuna along with S4akuni. (S4loka 122, Chap-
<>ter 156, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RUN2I V. One of the one hundred and eight Upanis2ads.
<HI>A1RUS2I1. A daughter of Manu. Cyavana Mahars2i married
<>her. They got a son named Aurva. The child was

<>Aurva. Rci1ka was the father of Jamadagni, father of
<>Paras4ura1ma. Even from childhood Aurva was a bold,
<>bright and good boy. (S4lokas 47 and 48, Chapter 66,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAS. The R2gveda gives us most of the information
<>regarding the A1ryas who came to the north of India
<>during the times of the Vedas through the passes on
<>that north-western side of Bha1rata. Sirdar K.M. Panikar
<>writing in his preface to the ‘R2gvedasam3hita1’ by Poet
<>Vallathol summarises the information available in the
<>R2gveda about A1ryan culture and says: “When the
<>A1ryans first entered India they were rich in
<>cattle. They used to breed goats, dogs, donkeys, and
<>horses. The elephant was unknown to them. In the
<>Vedas the vehicle of Ind a is a horse and not an eleph-
<>ant. When hailing Indra they shout ‘come, come on
<>your horse-back’. The Veda does not say anything
<>about how Indra got the elephant, Aira1vata, as his
<>vehicle. Sing to the glory of Indra against whom in
<>his chariot driven by two horses no enemy would dare
<>to face.
<NI>The R2gveda gives great importance to agriculture.
<>Areas under cultivation were called Urvara and
<>‘Ks2etra’. Fields were ploughed by attaching six, eight
<>and even twelve bullocks to the plough. Water was taken
<>from hr2adas and Kulyakas (ponds and tanks) for the
<>purpose of irrigation. Agriculture was a very familiar
<>art to them. They used to cultivate all sorts of grains
<>and grams including yava. They conducted trade by
<>the exchange of goods generally. There is a reference
<>in one place of the use of a coin ‘Nis2ka’
<NI>The A1ryas were clever in the art of leather work, wood-
<>work and metallurgy. They were well versed in medi-
<>cine also. In a su1kta of the ninth man2d2ala it is stated
<>that the father of a r2s2i was a medical practitioner.
<>There are references to many industries also. Weav-
<>ing was a very important industry at that time. Cotton
<>cloth and woollen blankets were made by them on a
<>large scale. Iron was used by them with great skill.
<>The manufacture of armours and the descriptions about
<>them in R2gveda are ample evidence of the proficiency
<>of the A1ryas in ironmongery and blacksmithy. Sea
<>voyage was not familiar to them. References to traders
<>cruising in boats in the Sindhu river do not give much
<>importance to the cruising. In food rice and ghee were
<>important. Meat was also relished. Rs2is wore animal
<>skins but others wore dhotis and shawls.
<NI>During the R2gvedic times their social structure was
<>divided into four stages: Gra1ma was a colony of fami-
<>lies and was the nucleus of the society. A number of
<>gramas formed into a place called Vis2aya. A number
<>of Vis2ayas became what was known as ‘Janam’. The
<>importance of Janas can be understood by the state- [Page091-b+ 65]
<>ments made about Pan5cajanas and the existence of
<>special Janas like Ya1dava Jana and Bha1rata Jana.
<NI>There is no wonder why the A1ryas who had to live among
<>enemies accepted kingship. The R2gveda narrates the
<>difficulties people would have to encounter if they were
<>left to fight their enemies without a proper leader and
<>so advocates Kingship and gives it an exalted position
<>in their social structure. Su1kta 22, Anuva1ka 12 of
<>Man2d2ala 10 describes the coronation of a King thus:
<>“I do hereby crown you as King. Come to our midst.
<>Rule us with courage and an unwavering mind. Let
<>all your subjects love you. Let thy kingdom remain
<>with you for ever”. The next mantra is also of the
<>same idea. A King is above punishment. The veda
<>speaks about many famous kings of which the following
<>are worth mentioning. Divoda1sa, Suda1s, Ambari1s2a,
<>Nahus2a and Puru1ravas.
<NI>The chief priest was always the political advisor also.
<>Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha were two great priests of the
<>Bharata dynasty. There were other priests also. Men-
<>tion is there about a Ra1jasabha1 though nothing is said
<>about their powers or functions. It can be surmised
<>that the Sabha1 was constituted of only men of character
<>and learning.
<NI>It is interesting to note the type of domestic life in
<>vogue then. A father had the right, to sell his children,
<>To cite an example is the story of S4unas4s4epha who was
<>made into a cow and sold to Vis4va1mitra who looked
<>after him well. The father had the right to make his
<>children lose all rights over his properties. Vis4va1mitra
<>sent out from his family fifty sons who refused to obey
<>him. Dowry was current then. Su1kta 11, Anuva1ka 3,
<>Man2d2alam 10 ordains that the bride should go to the
<>house of her husband after the marriage. Polygamy was
<>not objected to. There is a mantra to harass the co-wife
<>and its purpose is to make the husband more attached
<>to her who hates the co-wife. The originator of this
<>mantra was Indra1n2i1, the queen of Indra. Indra had
<>many wives. Marriage was considered as a necessary
<>duty. Widow marriage was allowed.
<NI>The R2gveda gives the picture of a society of people
<>who were always at war with each other. “We are
<>surrounded by mighty enemies. Help us”. This is the
<>slogan that rings out from the R2gveda.
<NI>The R2gveda is a history of the A1ryas. The march from
<>Kubha1tat2a (Kubul) to the banks of Yamuna1 is depict-
<>ed there. It was at Kubha1tat2a that the mantras were
<>first made. When they reach the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>the period of R2gveda ends. The crossing of each of
<>the five rivers of Pan5canada is treated as a big event
<>by the r2s2is. When they saw the huge and deep river,
<>Sindhu, they were amazed. The wonder is reflected in a
<>lovely mantra. It was after crossing Sindhu that they had
<>to oppose the ‘Dasyus’. The R2gveda itself records that
<>the Dasyus were more cultured than the A1ryas. S4am-
<>bara, a Dasyu King, was the ruler of a hundred cities.
<>Their fortresses were strong. They have been described
<>in the R2gveda as As4vamayi1, A1yasi1 and S4atabhuji1.
<NI>The chief opponents of the A1ryas were a tribe of people
<>called Pan2is. From the Nirukta of Ya1ska we are given
<>to understand that the Pan2is were mainly engaged in
<>trade. The R2gveda names many Dasyu kings of which
<>the following few were more daring and brave and the
<>A1ryas acknowledged their superior strength and courage:
<>Dhuni, Cumuri, Vipru, Varcis and S4ambara. Among [Page092-a+ 65]
<>the several divisions of the Dasyus, the S4imyus, Ki1kat2as,
<>S4igrus and Yaks2us ranked foremost in power. They are
<>described as having black colour and flat noses and
<>speaking a language different from that of the A1ryas.
<>We may surmise from these facts that they belonged
<>to the Dra1vid2a class of people. They never conducted
<>ya1ga nor did they worship gods like Indra. They were
<>idol worshippers for they have been abused as ‘S4is4na-
<>devas’. Later the A1ryas learnt from the Dasyus the
<>worship of S4iva, Devi1 and Lin3ga.
<NI>Conquering these daring and cultured enemies the
<>A1ryas reached the banks of the Yamuna1 to find to their
<>pleasant surprise a radical change in themselves. The
<>Bharatas settled themselves in the land between the
<>Yamuna1 and Gan3ga1 and remained friendly with the
<>Dasyus living to the east of Gan3ga1. The A1ryas who
<>settled down in Pan5canada were strong and to prevent
<>them from coming and conquering them Bharata tried
<>to keep them remain on the other side of S4utudri
<>(Sutlej). This led to a war called Da1s4ara1jn5a.
<NI>This war is to be considered as one of the most impor-
<>tant of wars in the world. Those who opposed Suda1s
<>were A1ryas though among the supporters of Suda1s were
<>also A1ryas. It was the people under Suda1s who came
<>out victorious in that war and put a stop to further
<>conquests by the A1ryas. From thereafter the A1ryas
<>joined hands with the aborigines and laid the foundation
<>for the great Hindu civilization. Thereafter the R2gveda
<>states about prayers for help to combat ‘our enemies
<>of A1ryas and Dasyus’. The gods who were recognised
<>later were those who were not found in the vedas of
<>the A1ryas. The worship of Maha1yogi1 and Devi1 found
<>in Mohenjodaro is an evidence of this change.
<HI>A1RYA1. One of the seven mothers who were present at
<>the birth of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 13, Chapter 228,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAKA. A famous serpent. (S4loka 7, Chapter 35,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.) A1ryaka is associated with Bhi1masena
<>in the following story. Once Duryodhana gave snake
<>poison in his food to Bhi1masena. Unaware Bhi1ma took
<>his food as usual and went to bathe in the river. After
<>some time Bhi1ma became unconscious due to the effect
<>of the poison and fell flat in the river.
<NI>Immediately Duryodhana bound him by ropes and put
<>him in more deep waters. Bhi1ma reaching the bottom
<>was bitten by all the snakes there. This fortunately
<>served as an antidote and the poison in Bhi1ma's body
<>was neutralized and Bhi1ma became his old self again
<>and killed all the serpents. Those serpents who escaped
<>went and brought their chief, Va1suki. At that time it was
<>A1ryaka who advised Va1suki to give him ‘rasapa1na’.
<>(S4lokas 64-68, Chapter 127, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAKU. Another name for Durga1devi1. (Chapter 12,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1RYA1VARTA. Another name for Bha1rata. There is
<>also a place of that name. According to Smr2ti the land
<>lying between the Hima1layas and the Vindhyas is called
<>A1rya1varta. (S4loka 15, Chapter 325, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYA1VARTA. A king of the dynasty of Vis4vakarma1.
<>{%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u are Brahma1,
<>Dharma, Prabha1sa, Vis4vakarma1, Priyavrata, Agni1dhra,
<>Na1bhi, R2s2abha and A1rya1varta.
<NI>Of these R2s2abha got of his wife Jayanti1 twenty sons:
<>Bharata, Kus4a1varta, Ila1varta, Brahma1varta, Arya1varta
<>Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspr2k, Vidarbha, [Page092-b+ 65]
<>Ki1kat2a, Kavi, Hari, Antari1ks2a, Prabuddha, Pippala1yana,
<>A1virhotra, Dramid2a, Camasa and Karabha1jana. Of these
<>Bharata ruled over this land and gave it the name
<>Bha1rata. Brothers of Bharata ruled different parts of this
<>land. Dramid2a's land became known later as Dra1vid2a
<>(Daks2in2abha1rata).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA I. A Ks2atriya King. He was the incarnation
<>of a Ra1ks2asa called Krodhavas4a. Kas4yapa was the son
<>of Mari1ci, Brahma1's son. Kas4yapa married Krodha-
<>vas4a1, daughter of Daks2a. The Ra1ks2asa group called
<>Krodhavas4as were the children of Krodhavas4a1. Many
<>Ks2atriya kings trace their descent from this group of
<>Ra1ks2asas. The names of such Ks2atriya Kings are given
<>below: Madraka, Karn2aves2t2ha, Siddha1rtha, Ki1t2a-

<>Ci1rava1sas, Kauravya, Dantavaktra, Durjaya, Rukmi,
<>Janamejaya, A1s2a1d2ha, Va1yuvega, Bhu1ritejas, Ekalavya,
<>Sumitra, Gomukha, Va1tadha1na, and Ks2emadhu1rti.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 6, Verses 59-64).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA II. S4iva. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>17, Verse 121).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HABHU1TI. See under Pan5catantra.
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA. Name of a month. By feasting in this month,
<>one will have many sons and much wealth. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 106, Verse 26).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA. Name of a star. After observing a fast on the
<>day of this star, if curd is given to a Brahmin of noble
<>birth, one can take rebirth in a family having many
<>cows. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 64, Verses
<>25-26).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HAKA. A mahout in the Udayana story. In
<>Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka, 5th Taran3ga, we
<>find a reference to an elephant called Bhadravati1 and a
<>mahout named A1s2a1d2haka in the palace of the heroine,
<>Va1savadatta1.
<HI>A1SAM3GA. See under ANAS4A.
<HI>A1SAM3GAPLA1YOGI. A King, who was generous by
<>nature. In the R2gveda, there is a reference to this King
<>who once lost his masculinity and was transformed into
<>a woman but was restored to manhood by a Muni
<>named Medhya1tithi.
<HI>A1SANA. Posture in Yoga1bhya1sa. There are different
<>types of a1sanas. The chief of them are given below:
<NI>1) {%Bhujan3ga1sana.%} Lying flat, face downwards on a
<>sheet with hands placed close to the body on either
<>side. After relaxing all the muscles of the body, concen-
<>trate the mind on health. Keeping the feet close to-
<>gether and pressing the knees against the ground, raise
<>the soles upwards to the sky. Place both palms, pressing
<>against the ground, touching the shoulders on both
<>sides. Then raise the head and bend the neck back-
<>wards as far as possible. At this time, the trunk and
<>legs should be in close contact with the ground. Gra-
<>dually raise the chest, supported by the hands on the
<>ground. Bring the head down in the same way as it was
<>raised and restore the body to its former position. This
<>a1sana strengthens the backbone.
<NI>2) {%S4alabha1sana.%} Lie flat on the sheet, face downwards.
<>Keep the legs close together and raise the feet up with
<>the heels touching each other. Place the hands close
<>to the body on either side and close the fists upwards.
<>Place the fists and shoulders close to the ground and
<>make the whole body stiff after inhaling the breath.
<>Then try to raise the legs. Support the weight of the
<>body with the breast and hands. This is possible by [Page093-a+ 65]
<>pressing the fists, firmly against the ground. Until the
<>a1sana is completed, do not send out the breath. Keep
<>the legs straight and stiff. The lower abdomen and legs
<>may be raised slightly. This makes the a1sana complete.
<>On feeling suffocation, the legs must be brought down
<>slowly.
<NI>Besides these, there are many other a1sanas like Dhanur-
<>a1sana, Pas4cima1ta1na1sana, Hala1sana, Mayu1ra1sana,
<>Sarva1n3ga1sana, Matsya1sana, S4i1rs2a1sana, Arddhamatsy-
<>endra1sana, Pa1dahasta1sana, Trikon2a1sana, Ud2d2i1ya1sana,
<>Nauli, Vipari1takaran2i, Yogamudra1, S4ava1sana, etc. (See
<>under Yoga).
<HI>A1S4A1VAHA I. A son of Kas4yapa and Aditi. From Vis2n2u
<>Brahma1, from Brahma1 Mari1ci and from Mari1ci Kas4yapa
<>were born. Kas4yapa married Aditi, daughter of Daks2a.
<>Aditi gave birth to ten sons: Br2hadbha1nu, Caks2ur-
<>a1tma1, Vibha1vasu, R2ci1ka, Savita1, Arka, Bha1nu, A1s4a1vaha,
<>Ravi and Vivasva1n. Vaivasvata Manu was the son of
<>Vivasva1n. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 42).
<HI>A1S4A1VAHA II. A prince of the Vr2s2n2i dynasty. He was
<>present at the Svayam3vara of Draupadi1. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 19).
<HI>A1S4RAMA. Asramites (Inmates of an A1s4rama) have to pass
<>through four stages. The four stages of Brahmacarya,
<>Ga1rhasthya, Va1naprastha and Sannya1sa are known as
<>the four A1s4ramas. Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part III, Chapter 9
<>describes each of the A1s4ramas as follows:
<NI>1. {%Brahmacarya.%} “After Upanayana a boy should
<>maintain a Brahmaca1ri1's vrata, engage himself in the
<>study of the Vedas, suppress his indriyas (the five
<>senses) and live in the house of the preceptor. Living
<>there with proper observance of s4auca, customs and
<>vratas he should serve and attend on the Guru. The
<>study of Vedas should be with proper observance of
<>Vratas and steady attention. A Brahmaca1ri1 should
<>worship with concentration, the Sun and Agni at the
<>time of the two sandhya1s (dawn and dusk) and after
<>that he should do obeisance to the Guru. When the Guru
<>stands, he should also be standing. When the guru walks,
<>he should walk behind him and when he sits, he should
<>sit in a lower position. The S4is2ya (disciple-pupil) should
<>not do anything against the guru. When the guru him-
<>self asks, the S4is2ya should sit in front of him and recite
<>Vedas without attending to anything else. After that,
<>with his permission he may eat food which has been
<>got by begging. The S4is2ya may take his bath in the
<>water only after the A1ca1rya (guru) has taken his bath
<>in it. Everyday the Camata, darbha, water and flowers
<>which the guru needs, must be brought and supplied
<>(by the S4is2ya).
<NI>2. {%Ga1rhasthya.%} After the study of the Vedas the intelli-
<>gent s4is2ya gives Gurudaks2in2a1 (Payment to the precep-
<>tor) and with the consent of the Guru, enters into
<>Gr2hastha1s4rama. Then he is to marry and by earning
<>money from a suitable occupation, should fulfil all
<>obligations of a Gr2hastha according to his capacity.
<>The Gr2hastha who worships the Pitr2s with Pin2d2ada1na
<>(offerings of rice balls), Devas with Ya1gas (sacrifices),
<>R2s2is with Sva1dhya1ya (self discipline), Praja1patis with
<>begetting of children, spirits with bali (offering of food
<>etc.) and the whole world with love, attains the holy
<>world by his own virtuous deeds. Gr2hastha1s4rama is the
<>only source of support for sannya1si1s and brahmaca1ri1s
<>who beg their food. Therefore feeding them is an act
<>of nobility. Bra1hman2as travel from country to country [Page093-b+ 65]
<>to study Vedas, for pilgrimage and for seeing the places.
<>The Gr2hastha is the only refuge and support of those
<>who are homeless, who do not carry their food with
<>them and those who spend the night wherever they
<>reach. If such people come to his house, the Gr2hastha
<>should welcome them with kind and loving words, and
<>give them bed, seat and food. The guest who leaves a
<>house disappointed, is really departing after transfer-
<>ring his own sins to that householder and taking away
<>all the virtuous deeds of the householder. It is not
<>proper for the Gr2hastha to treat a guest with disrespect,
<>to behave rudely or treacherously towards him, to regret
<>what has been given to the guest, or to obstruct or
<>rebuke him. The Gr2hastha who performs the supreme
<>duty of Gr2hastha1s4rama in this way properly, is liberated
<>from all secular bonds and reaches the noblest worlds.
<NI>3. {%Va1naprastha.%} After having finished all his duties in
<>this way, to his satisfaction, the Gr2hastha, with the
<>commencement of old age, should go to the forest, either
<>after entrusting his wife to his sons or taking her also
<>with him. There, he should use leaves, roots and fruits
<>for his food, grow hair and beard, sleep on the bare
<>ground, lead the life of a ta1pasa and receive and honour
<>all classes of guests. His clothes, sheets and blankets
<>should be of deer-skin and darbha grass. The rule is
<>that he should bathe three times a day. Worship of gods,
<>performing homas, hospitality to all guests, mendicancy
<>-all these are the laudable features of Va1naprastha.
<>Any oil that is available in the forest is to be used for
<>his oil bath. Enduring heat and cold, performing tapas,
<>are also his duties. The Muni who observes this rule in
<>Va1naprastha with due austerity, burns up all his evils as
<>with fire and attains the eternal worlds.
<NI>4. {%Sannya1sa.%} The fourth A1s4rama is that of the Sannya1si1.
<>Before entering upon the fourth A1s4rama one has to
<>renounce the love of travel, wealth and wife and also
<>give up all spirit of rivalry. One who embraces sann-
<>ya1sa should abandon completely the efforts for the
<>three Purus2a1rthas of Dharma, Artha and Ka1ma, treat
<>friends and foes alike and continue to love all living
<>beings. Not even a single creature should be offended
<>by thought, word or deed. Conquering all passions,
<>the Sannya1si1 should renounce all bonds and attach-
<>ments. He should not stay in a village more than one
<>night and in a town more than five nights. Even that
<>should be in such a way that no one feels any love or
<>hatred towards him. For sustaining life, he should go
<>about begging food from the houses of the people of
<>the three castes--Brahmins, Ks2atriyas and Vais4yas. It
<>should be after all people have taken their food and
<>put out the cooking fire. The Sannya1si1 should cast
<>away all vices like Ka1ma, Krodha, Garva, Lobha, and
<>Moha and should not have any thought of self in any-
<>thing. The Muni who goes about giving shelter to all
<>creatures will not have to fear any creature. The
<>Bra1hman2a who follows the Sannya1sa1s4rama as described
<>above with a pure heart and without difficulty will
<>shine like fire without fuel and attain Brahmaloka in
<>peace.
<HI>A1S4RAMAVA1SA PARVA. One of the Parvas in the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1S4RAMAVA1SIKA PARVA. One of the Parvas in the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1S4RA1VYA. A muni (sage) in Indra's assembly. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 18). [Page094-a+ 65]
<HI>A1STI1KA. The son of the Mahars2i Jaratka1ru and his wife,
<>also named Jaratka1ru. He stopped King Janamejaya's
<>Sarpasatra and saved the na1gas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about A1sti1ka's birth in the
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata. Long ago the people of the world were
<>so much troubled by the serpents, that they sought pro-
<>tection from Kas4yapa Praja1pati. To find a remedy for
<>this, Kas4yapa discussed the matter with Brahma1. To
<>put an end to the troubles from the serpents, Brahma1
<>suggested that a number of mantras and a deity as the
<>basis of those mantras should be created. Accordingly
<>Kas4yapa created many mantras and Manasa1 Devi1 as the
<>basic deity of those mantras. She is named “Manasa1-
<>devi1” because Kas4yapa created her by his mental
<>power. Manasa1devi1 has eleven other names also, name-
<>ly Jaratka1ru, Jagatgauri1, Siddhayogini1, Vais2n2avi1, Na1ga-
<>bhagini1, S4aivi1, Na1ges4vari1, Jaratka1rupriya1, A1sti1kama1ta1,
<>Vis2ahara1 and Maha1jn5a1nayuta1.
<NI>Manasa1devi1 (Jaratka1ru) when quite young, went to
<>Kaila1sa for doing tapas (penance). There she did tapas
<>to S4iva for a thousand years. At last S4iva appeared and
<>blessed her with divine wisdom. She returned with
<>great learning and devotion. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<NI>At that time, a Muni (sage) named Jaratka1ru, when
<>travelling through the forest happened to see his pitr2s
<>(souls of forefathers) hanging over a precipice at
<>the end of a blade of grass. They were hanging preca-
<>riously at the end of a reed grass, head downwards,
<>about to fall into the abyss. Jaratka1ru enquired why
<>they were lying in that condition. They explained that
<>they were in that plight because their descendant
<>Jaratka1ru had no children. As he is a bachelor there
<>is no hope either, of his having any issue. Since he
<>has no children, we will not get to heaven, they added.
<>To save the Pitr2s from their predicament, Jaratka1ru
<>decided to marry. But he wished to marry a woman
<>who had the same name as his. Once Va1suki met
<>Jaratka1ru and told him that he had a sister named
<>Jaratka1ru and that he would be very happy if Jaratka1ru
<>married her. Jaratka1ru accepted the offer readily and
<>married Jaratka1ru.
<NI>After their marriage, while they were living together
<>in a place called Pus2kara ti1rtha, an unexpected event
<>happened which interrupted the happy course of their
<>life. One evening, the husband was sleeping with his
<>head in the wife's lap, under a tree. The sun was about
<>to set. As the Mahars2i did not wake up before sunset, the
<>wife became anxious. It is believed that he who does not
<>wake up before sunrise and he who does not offer pray-
<>ers at dusk will be guilty of the sin of Brahmahatya1 (kill-
<>ing a Brahmin). Nor was it proper to wake him up from
<>a sound sleep. But in the end, she did wake him up.
<>The husband sprang up in great fury. He renounced
<>the wife then and there. Weeping bitterly, she begged
<>for his forgiveness. At last Jaratka1ru relented and
<>told her: “You will have a very noble, brilliant, re-
<>nowned, virtuous, scholarly and devout son who will be
<>a devotee of Vis2n2u and a preserver of the family”.
<>After this Manasa1devi1 set out to Kaila1sa. When she
<>reached there Parama-S4iva and Pa1rvati1 comforted her.
<NI>Manasa1devi1 was pregnant. The precepts and spiritual
<>advice given by Jaratka1ru, Parama-S4iva and Pa1rvati1
<>were heard by the child in the womb and so even before
<>his birth he became a Jn5a1ni1 and a yogi1. In due course [Page094-b+ 65]
<>Manasa1devi1 gave birth to a son who was a part of
<>Na1ra1yan2a (Vis2n2u). Since he was the son of Manasa1-
<>devi1 who had deep devotion to the Guru and to the
<>Gods, the boy was named A1sti1ka.
<NI>The Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, gives another reason for
<>giving this name to the boy. When the sage Jaratka1ru
<>abandoned his wife, he had blessed her saying that the
<>child in her womb would be a brilliant and devoted
<>son. That is why this boy came to be called A1sti1ka.
<NI>2) {%Boyhood%} A1sti1ka was taught Veda, Veda1m3gas etc.
<>by Parama-S4iva himself. After receiving the blessings
<>of Parama-S4iva, A1sti1ka went to Pus2kara ti1rtha and did
<>tapas to Vis2n2u for many years. Having received Vis2n2u's
<>blessings also, he returned to Kaila1sa. After living there
<>happily with his mother for some time, one day they
<>started to the A1s4rama of Kas4yapa Praja1pati, the
<>father of Manasa1devi1. Kas4yapa was very much pleased
<>to see his noble-hearted daughter and her brilliant
<>son. To enhance the fame and accomplishments of
<>the boy Kas4yapa gave a sumptuous feast to ten crores
<>of Brahmins. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>Va1suki was Manasa1devi1's brother. A1sti1ka grew up
<>there under the care of Va1suki. It was Cyavana Muni
<>who taught Sa1m3gavedas to A1sti1ka, at this time. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 18).
<NI>3) {%A1sti1ka at the Sarpasatra.%} Once King Pari1ks2it, the
<>son of Abhimanyu was travelling through the forest for
<>hunting animals. He picked up a dead snake with the
<>tip of his bow and put it on the shoulder of a sage
<>named “S4ami1ka”. S4ami1ka's son, S4r2m3gi1 came to know
<>of this. In his anger, S4r2m3gi1 pronounced a curse that
<>King Pari1ks2it should die within seven days by the bite
<>of Taks2aka. When Pari1ks2it heard of this, he had a
<>palace built on a single pillar in the middle of the
<>ocean, quite inaccessible to Taks2aka and took shelter
<>there. The most famous physicians and wizards were
<>engaged to ward off the approach of Taks2aka to that
<>place. Six days passed like this. On the seventh day,
<>determined to make a final attempt, Taks2aka disguised
<>himself as an old Bra1hman2a and set out to the King's
<>place of shelter. On his way he met Dhanvantari who
<>was proceeding to Pari1ks2it to protect him. They be-
<>came friends and as a result of it, Dhanvantari returned
<>after receiving a large number of rare precious stones
<>given to him by Taks2aka. Assuming the form of a small
<>worm, Taks2aka secretly entered into a fruit which was
<>to be presented to the King. As soon as the King took
<>that fruit in his hand, Taks2aka took his own shape
<>and size and bit the King who died immediately.
<>Janamejaya was the son of this King Pari1ks2it.
<NI>Janamejaya performed all the obsequies of his father.
<>After that, in a spirit of revenge, with the object of
<>annihilating the whole race of serpents, he summoned
<>Bra1hman2as to conduct a sarpa satra (snake sacrifice).
<NI>In the sacrificial fire specially prepared at that ya1ga,
<>many serpents were being burnt up. It seemed that the
<>whole race of serpents would shortly be wiped out.
<>But Taks2aka alone was not to be seen. The officiating
<>priests were beginning to get angry. Impatient cries
<>of Where is Taks2aka rent the air. The frightened
<>Taks2aka fled for life to the palace of his friend Indra
<>and there lay down, curling round Indra's cot. When
<>the priests understood this they decided to use their
<>charms and mantras which would bring Indra, his bed,
<>cot and all, along with Taks2aka to the sacrificial fire. [Page095-a+ 65]
<>At this stage, all the gods rushed to Manasa1devi1 and
<>fell at her feet and begged her to save the situation.
<>The kindhearted Devi1 called her son A1sti1ka and advis-
<>ed him to persuade Janamejaya to stop the sarpa-
<>satra. A1sti1ka went to Janamejaya and requested him
<>to give him the lives of Taks2aka and Indra as a gift.
<>Janamejaya, after consulting the munis and priests
<>and at their advice, agreed to do so. In this way, the
<>Sarpasatra was stopped and the remaining serpents
<>escaped with their lives. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama

<>Parva, M.B.).

<>he was killed with a mace thrown at him. (Chapter 5,
<>Mausala Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BABHRUMA1LI. A sage. He was a lively member of the

<HI>BABHRUVA1HANA. A son of Arjuna.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} When the Pa1n2d2avas were residing in Indra-
<>prastha after marrying Pa1n5ca1li1, Na1rada went to see
<>them once. With a view to avoiding any quarrel bet-
<>ween the Pa1n2d2avas over the one wife they jointly possess-
<>ed, Na1rada suggested that each should take Pa1n5ca1li1
<>for a year in turn and he who violated the arrange-
<>ment should go to the forest for a year. Once Arjuna
<>went to the house of Yudhis2t2hira who was with Pa1n5ca1li
<>and for thus violating the arrangement Arjuna had to
<>go to the forest for a year. During this exile while he
<>was staying at Gan3ga1dva1ra he married the serpent girl,
<>Ulu1pi and got a son called Ira1va1n of her.
<NI>After that he went to a country called Man2alu1r. At
<>that time that country was being ruled by a king called
<>Citra1n3gada. Prabhan5jana one of the forefathers of
<>Citra1n3gada had, by hard penance for a progeny, acquir-
<>ed from S4iva a boon and each of his successors got a
<>son each to maintain the line. But when it came to
<>Citra1n3gada to his surprise he got a girl instead of a son.
<>But he got her up as a son and named her Citra1n3gada.
<>It was when she was ready for marriage that Arjuna
<>went there. The king received Arjuna with respect and
<>after enquiring about his welfare requested him to marry
<>his daughter. Arjuna married her and stayed there for
<>three months. Leaving that place Arjuna went to
<>Pan5cati1rtha and there he gave salvation to the celestial
<>maidens who were lying in the ti1rthas as crocodiles.
<>When he went back to Man2alu1r Citra1n3gada1 had deli-
<>vered a son whom he named Babhruva1hana. Promising [Page097-a+ 65]
<>them that he would take them later to Hastina1pura, he
<>left the place.
<NI>2) {%His fate to kill his own father.%} It was by a ruse that
<>Arjuna made Bhi1s2ma fall. Arjuna put S4ikhan2d2i1 before
<>his chariot and Bhi1s2ma refused to take arms against a
<>eunuch and accepted defeat. But Gan3ga1devi1 witnessing
<>the battle between Bhi1s2ma, her son, and Arjuna from
<>above could not bear this foul play and so cursed that
<>Arjuna would die at the hands of his son. Ulu1pi the
<>serpent wife of Arjuna heard this curse and went to her
<>father Kauravya who in turn went to Gan3ga1 and begged
<>for a relief from the curse. Gan3ga1devi1 then said that
<>Arjuna would be killed by Babhruva1hana but would be
<>brought to life by Ulu1pi by placing the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1
<>stone on the dead man's breast.
<NI>3) {%The killing of Arjuna.%} The Maha1bha1rata battle was
<>over. When Yudhis2t2hira was performing the As4vamedha
<>ya1ga Arjuna conducted a victory march with the ya1ga
<>horse. On his way he reached Man2alu1r. At once Ulu1pi
<>called Babhruva1hana and asked him to challenge Arjuna.
<>Babhruva1hana with his bow and arrows attacked Arjuna
<>and in the grim battle that followed Arjuna fell dead.
<>Seeing this Citra1n3gada1 came to the place of battle
<>weeping and abused Ulu1pi for persuading Babhruva1hana
<>to kill his own father. Ulu1pi immediately went to the
<>serpent world and brought the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 stone and
<>as she placed it on Arjuna's breast he came to life as if
<>waking up from a sleep. When he saw Citra1n3gada1,
<>Babhruva1hana and Ulu1pi1 he smiled and asked them
<>why they had all come there. Ulu1pi1 then explained to
<>him the story of the curse and extremely pleased over
<>the end of the curse Arjuna took them all to Hastina1-
<>pura. (Chapters 218 to 210 of A1di Parva and Chapters
<>79 to 82 of As4vamedha Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%} (1) On reaching Hastina1pura S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>gave Babhruva1hana as a present a chariot drawn by
<>divine horses. (S4loka 6, Chapter 88, As4vamedha
<>Parva, M.B.).

<>suta and Man2ipures4vara.

<HI>BADARI1PA1CANA TI1RTHA. (BADARAPA1CANA). A
<>sacred place in Kuruks2etra. If one lives here fasting for

<HI>BA1HU I. A king of the Su1rya-vam3s4a (solar dynasty). He
<>was the father of Sagara. He is known by the name
<>Suba1hu also. This king was once defeated in a battle and
<>being weary and sad he entered the hermitage of Aurva.
<>His queen was given poison by another wife of the
<>King. But the child in her womb did not die. The queen
<>wanted to jump into the fire in which the body of her
<>husband was to be burned. But Aurva told her that her
<>son would become a famous king and that she should
<>not commit suicide. Thus she desisted from committing
<>suicide. A son was born to her. As she had been poison-
<>ed when the child was in her womb the son was given
<>the name Sagara (with poison). It is said in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva that this prince became a famous

<>made about this king in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva,

<HI>BAHUBHA1RYA1TVA. (Polygamy). Polygamy was a
<>custom in vogue in ancient India. It was not prohibit-
<>ed for a man to have more than one wife. It was
<>customary to give dowry also. It is said in the R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 10, Anuva1ka 3, Su1kta 11 that the bride should
<>proceed to the house of the husband, after the marriage.
<>A spell (mantra) meant for keeping down one's co-wife,
<>is seen in the R2gveda, Man2d2ala 10, Anuva1ka 11, Su1kta
<>17. It is a prayer to destroy the love of husband for a
<>co-wife and to direct that love towards oneself. The
<>deity of this spell is Indra1n2i1 the wife of Indra who was
<>a polygamist. In those days marriage was an essential
<>duty. Widow marriage was not forbidden.
<HI>BA1HUDA1. A holy bath. If one stays in this place for a
<>night in celibacy and fast, one will get the fruits of
<>performing a sacrifice to devas (gods). The modern

<HI>BAKA I. A demon. The Pa1n2d2avas escaping from the
<>trap of Arakkilla (lac-house) through a secret tunnel
<>went to the village Ekacakra1 on the banks of the
<>river Gan3ga1 and stayed there in the house of a brahmin.
<>Baka was a demon who was terrorising the villagers
<>there. He used to come to the village freely and carry
<>away people for his food. Because of this nobody lived
<>in peace and so they all joined together and decided
<>to send one man daily with plenty of other eatables to
<>the demon in this cave. Days went by like that and
<>one day the turn came to the brahmin who was shelter-
<>ing the Pa1n2d2avas. That brahmin had besides his wife
<>one son and a daughter. The problem arose as to who
<>should go to the demon. The father was willing but
<>the wife did not want him to go and vice versa. The
<>children began to cry and hearing the noise Kunti1,
<>mother of the Pa1n2d2avas, went there to enquire and
<>learned the tragic story of the family. She immediately
<>went to Bhi1ma and acquainted him with the problem
<>before the brahmin. Bhi1ma at once volunteered to go
<>to the demon deciding to kill the man-eater and thus
<>putting an end to his depredations.
<NI>Bhi1ma started on his journey to the demon carrying a
<>cartload of rice and curry. Deliberately Bhi1ma arrived
<>at the place of the demon very late. Baka rolled his
<>eyes in anger at the sight of the late-comer. But
<>Bhi1ma without heeding him sat in front of the demon
<>and started eating the rice and curry. Baka charged
<>at Bhi1ma with fury but Bhi1ma defended and a battle
<>ensued in which Baka was killed and he fell dead
<>like a mountain-head dropping down.
<F>*) Kirmi1ra, a demon, was the brother of Baka. (S4loka 23, Chapter 11, Aran2ya Parva, M.B.).
<>{%f%} It is in the 10th Skandha of Bha1gavata that the story of this Baka occurs. But in the vernacular translation of the same the story is
<>not so clear. Hence the original in Sanskrit is quoted below:

<>la) on the banks of the river Yamuna1 when the
<>demon, Baka, despatched by Kam3sa, went to them in

<>one of the pa1rs2adas who then came to the scene to
<>quell the trouble. (As2t2ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>BALA IX. A son of Ma1ya1sura. He lived in a place in
<>the netherlands called Atala. He created ninetysix
<>different kinds of magic and gave them to the asura
<>magicians who by the use of them gave the devas
<>immense trouble.
<NI>Once when Bala1sura yawned three bad women, Svairin2i1,
<>Ka1mini1 and Pum3s4cali1 were born. They had with them
<>a potable substance called Ha1t2aka which they gave to
<>men whom they liked and after enlivening the sex
<>impulse in them enjoyed a sexual life with them to
<>their heart's content. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<>Once during a fight between Indra and Jalandhara
<>Bala defeated Indra in a pathetic way. Indra then sought
<>refuge in him and praised him with songs. Flattered
<>by this Bala asked Indra to ask of him whatever he
<>wanted and the sly Indra requested for the physical
<>body of Bala. Without the least hesitation Bala cut his
<>body into pieces and gave him. Indra threw away the
<>cut pieces to different sides and all the places where
<>these pieces fell were at once transformed into Diamond

<HI>BALABHADRA. (Balabhadrara1ma, Balara1ma, Baladeva).
<>The elder brother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the eighth incarna-
<>tion of Maha1vis2n2u.
<F>*) Since the life of Balabhadra is so mixed with that of Kr2s2n2a a complete life story of Balara1ma could be had only if it is read along
<>with that of Kr2s2n2a.</F>
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} When the number of wicked kings increased
<>Bhu1mi1devi1 (goddess of Earth) turned herself into a cow
<>and took refuge in Maha1vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u then pro-
<>mised to be born as the sons of Vasudeva named Bala-
<>bhadrara1ma and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and destroy the wicked.
<>Vasudeva was the son of the Ya1dava, S4u1rasena, King
<>of Madhura1. To Devaka the brother of another Ya1dava
<>King, Ugrasena, was born a daughter Devaki1. The
<>marriage of Devaki1 with Vasudeva was celebrated but
<>on the same day an As4ari1rin2i1 (a heavenly voice from
<>above) said that the eighth child of Devaki1 would
<>kill Kam3sa. Instantly Kam3sa put both Vasudeva and
<>Devaki1 in jail. The first six sons born to Devaki1 were
<>killed the moment they were born by striking them
<>against the ground. Devaki1 became pregnant for the
<>seventh time. The babe in the womb was Ananta in-
<>carnate by Vis2n2u's directive to be of help to him when
<>he would also be born soon as Kr2s2n2a. Therefore it
<>was necessary to save the child from the cruel hands
<>of Kam3sa as it was certain he would kill the babe the
<>same way he had killed all the others before. So he
<>ordered Ma1ya1devi1 to take the child from the womb of
<>Devaki1 and place it in that of Rohin2i1, another wife of
<>Vasudeva. Ma1ya1devi1 did so and the boy got the name
<>Sam3ghars2an2a, also because of this. The news spread
<>that Devaki1 aborted. Rohin2i1 delivered a boy and was
<>named Sam3ghars2an2a alias Balabhadrara1ma. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) {%The colour of Balara1ma and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is
<>the eighth child of Devaki1. The elder brother Balara1ma
<>is white in complexion while the younger, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is
<>black in complexion. There is a story behind this. The
<>devas decided to be born as Gopa1las (shepherds) in the
<>earth to be of help to Kr2s2n2a in his duty of killing the
<>wicked. They informed Maha1vis2n2u of their decision
<>and the Lord was immensely pleased. He then took
<>one white hair from his head and said that it would go
<>to Rohin2i1's womb and change into Balara1ma and [Page100-a+ 64]
<>taking a black hair said that it would go into Devaki1's
<>womb and change into S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. It was thus that
<>Balabhadra became white and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a black. (Chap-
<>ter 199, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Brothers.%} Balabhadrara1ma had six brothers born of
<>his mother Rohin2i1. They were: Gada, Sa1ran2a, Durd-
<>dama, Vipula, Dhruva, and Kr2ta. (Navama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) Till their marriage S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a spent his childhood
<>in Am3ba1d2i and Balara1ma, in Madhura1. Once the sage
<>Garga went to the house of Vasudeva and it was he
<>who then told the story behind the births of Balara1ma
<>and Kr2s2n2a. Hearing this Vasudeva went to Madhura1
<>and brought Balabhadrara1ma also to Am3ba1d2i. Garga-
<>muni then performed all those sacred rites which were
<>usually done to boys of that age and both of them then
<>remained in Am3ba1d2i. Several important events happen-
<>ed during their stay here, notable among which are:
<>Pu1tana1moks2am (killing of the demoness Pu1tana1 and
<>giving her salvation). S4akat2a1suravadha (killing the
<>asura, S4akat2a), Tr2n2a1varttavadha (killing the asura,
<>Tr2n2a1vartta), Vatsa1suravadha (killing the asura,
<>Vatsa), Bakavadha (killing the demon bird, Baka),
<>Agha1suravadha (killing the asura, Agha), Dhenuka1-
<>suravadha (killing the asura, Dhenuka), Ka1liamardana
<>(beating the snake, Ka1lia) and Pralambavadha (killing
<>Pralamba). (See under Kr2s2n2a for more details).
<NI>Kam3sa conducted a Ca1papu1ja1 (worship of the bow) to
<>kill Kr2s2n2a. It was on a festive scale and both Kr2s2n2a and
<>Balara1ma went to Madhura1 to attend the same. There
<>they killed Kam3sa and after that went to the a1s4rama
<>of Sa1ndi1pani Mahars2i for education. When they complet-
<>ed their education they at the request of the preceptor
<>gave as Gurudaks2in2a1 (The fee you pay in the end for
<>the instructions given) the lost child of the guru. Then
<>they went to Madhura1 and there several events took
<>place, important among which was the fight between
<>Kr2s2n2a and Jara1sandha. By this time the Ya1davas
<>were becoming lean financially and so to make some
<>money Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma went to the diamond-infested
<>mountain of Gomantaka. On their way they met
<>Paras4ura1ma doing penance under a Banyan tree. On
<>the advice of Paras4ura1ma they killed Sr2ga1lavasudeva
<>and got immense wealth. On their return Ra1ma and
<>Kr2s2n2a along with many Ya1davas went and settled down
<>in the island, Dva1raka1, in the western ocean. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Marriage.%} Before the advent of Balara1ma and Kr2s2n2a
<>the island Dva1raka1 was known as Kus4asthali1. It was
<>ruled over by a famous Ra1jars2i, Revata. This king was
<>the son of King A1nartta and grandson of emperor
<>S4arya1ti. Revata got a hundred sons, Kukudmin being
<>the first and a daughter named Revati1. When the time
<>for marriage of his daughter came the King was anxious
<>to find out a fitting husband for her and he went to
<>Brahmaloka to take the advice of Brahma1. Revati1 also
<>accompanied him. There stupefied he saw Vedas, Yajn5as,
<>mountains, rivers, oceans, R2tus, all in divine figures
<>standing before Brahma1, worshipping him. The sweet
<>celestial songs gave them both untold happiness. He
<>then told Brahma1 the purpose of his visit and Brahma1
<>meditating for some time told him that Balabhadrara1ma,
<>son of Vasudeva, was the only one person suited for
<>her. The king returned to Dva1raka1 and gave his [Page100-b+ 65]
<>daughter in marriage to Balara1ma. (Saptama Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>6) {%A pilgrimage.%} When the great Pa1n2d2ava-Kaurava
<>battle started Kr2s2n2a became the charioteer of Arjuna
<>and Balara1ma went to the forest, Naimis4a. He was not
<>much interested in the battle. At the forest of Naimis2a
<>he saw Su1ta telling Pura1n2ic stories to the several sages
<>assembled there before him. Su1ta did not rise up when
<>he saw Balara1ma and the latter moved to anger very
<>soon cut off the head of Su1ta. The sages assembled there
<>decried the act of Balara1ma and lamented deeply over
<>the incident. At this Balara1ma promised that he would
<>give birth, from the dead body of Su1ta, to one who will
<>be well versed in all the Vedas, s4a1stras and sciences. The
<>sages then blessed Balara1ma.
<NI>During that time there lived in the vicinity of Naimis2a
<>forest a demon called Balvala (Vatkala). He used to
<>annoy the sages there and the sages requested Bala-
<>ra1ma to put a stop to the atrocities of that demon. He
<>immediately killed the demon by his weapon, Hala,
<>and then raised from the dead body of Su1ta a pan2d2ita
<>of great erudition. Later, to remedy the sin of killing
<>Su1ta, Balara1ma, repentant, visited all the sacred places
<>in Bha1rata. Once when he heard about the grim battle
<>between Duryodhana and Bhi1masena, he went to the
<>battle-field and tried his best to stop the war. Dis-
<>appointed he returned to Dva1raka1. (Das4ama Skandha,
<>Chapter 79, Bha1gavata).
<NI>7) {%Death.%} Once the r2s2is Na1rada, Kan2va and Vis4va1-
<>mitra came to Dva1raka1. To make fun of them some of
<>the Ya1davas dressed a Ya1dava like a pregnant woman
<>and producing her before the sages asked them what
<>child she would deliver. Enraged at this the munis
<>said in one voice that she would deliver a mace and that
<>iron mace would be the cause of the end of all
<>Ya1davas.
<NI>After the Maha1bha1rata battle the Ya1dava dynasty re-
<>mained alive only for thirtysix years. After that by
<>the curse of the brahmin the Ya1davas were all killed in
<>a drunken brawl between themselves in the very pre-
<>sence of Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra. This happened on the
<>shore of Prabha1sa ti1rtha and Balara1ma was sitting
<>there then in deep meditation. Suddenly the soul of
<>Balara1ma went out from his mouth in the shape of a
<>white serpent and the serpent entering the nether world
<>was given a warm welcome by the prominent serpents
<>there. (Mausala Parva, M.B.).

<>vision of him in the shape of a cow-calf. After that in
<>the place where S4iva appeared as calf a S4ivalin3ga
<>arose. It began to grow to the extent of an atom daily.
<>But the growth ceased, when an outcaste who became
<>so by Karma (action) visited it. (Skandha Pura1n2a
<>3-2-27).
<HI>BALA1KA (VALA1KA). A forester. This forester used to
<>go for hunting and he gave everything he got to his old
<>parents without reserving anything for himself. One
<>day he did not find any animal even though he had
<>made a thorough search in the forest. He was much
<>worried. At last he reached the bank of a river. He
<>saw an extraordinary animal drinking water. He had
<>never seen such an animal before. [Page101-b+ 63]
<NI>It was a peculiar creature. That creature had done
<>penance before Brahma1, from its young age with the view
<>of destroying everything. Brahma1 appeared before the
<>creature and granted it the boon that it would have the
<>power to make anything blind. Brahma1 also said that
<>anybody who killed the creature would be given a place
<>in the realm of Gods. The creature had been wandering
<>in the forest making blind every creature it met, and
<>one day it was drinking water and it was then that
<>Vala1ka shot it down. As soon as the creature fell down
<>the gods showered flowers, and took him to the realm
<>of Gods in a divine chariot. (M.B., Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 69).
<HI>BALA1KA1TI1RTHA. (VALA1KA1TI1RTHA). A holy place
<>near the mountain of Gandhama1dana. Those who bathe
<>in this holy bath would become as bright and famous as
<>devas (gods) It is mentioned so in the Maha1bha1rata,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 19.
<HI>BALA1KA1S4VA. (VALA1KA1S4VA). He is the grandson of
<>the hermit Jahnu and the son of Aja otherwise called
<>Sindhudvi1pa. Bala1ka1s4va had a son called Kus4ika. (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 49, Stanza 3).
<HI>BA1LAKHILYA(S). (VA1LAKHILYAS). A group of
<>hermits.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Sixty thousand hermits were born to Kratu,
<>one of the Saptars2is (seven hermits), by his wife,
<>Santati.
<F>*) In some other Pura1n2as the mother of Ba1lakhilyas is given the name ‘Sannati’. This may be a mistake in the manuscript.</F> They are called Ba1lakhilyas. Everyone of
<>them was only the size of half a thumb, but they were
<>as bright as the blazing sun and had attained control
<>over their senses. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 10).
<NI>2) {%Garud2a (Eagle) and Ba1lakhilya(s).%} A story connect-
<>ing the birth of Garud2a with Ba1lakhilyas occurs in
<>the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Once Kas4yapa Praja1pati performed a sacrifice to
<>obtain children. The work of bringing firewood for
<>the sacrifice was entrusted to Indra and the other
<>devas (Gods) and the Ba1lakhilyas. When Indra was
<>heaping up on heaps pieces of big logs the Ba1lakhilyas
<>who were very small were bringing in chips of
<>wood. Seeing this Indra laughed. The Ba1lakhilyas
<>got angry and stopping the work entrusted to them
<>began to do penance with a view to create an-
<>other Indra. Knowing this Indra was much flurried.
<>He went to Kas4yapa and told him everything. Kas4yapa
<>went to the Ba1lakhilyas and pacified them. At this time
<>Vinata1, a wife of Kas4yapa, was doing penance to
<>obtain a son. Kas4yapa said that the penance of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas would not be fruitless and that as a result
<>of their penance a son who would overpower Indra
<>would be born to Vinata1. Accordingly a son was born
<>to her. Garud2a was that son. The fact that Garud2a
<>overthrew Indra when he went to heaven for ambrosia,
<>is well known. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 31).
<NI>3) {%Routine of life.%} The Ba1lakhilyas live in the man2d2ala
<>of Su1rya (solar region). They travel in front of the sun
<>in the shape of birds. They wear hides of animals. They
<>are righteous and are only as big as a thumb. They are
<>very ardent in doing the works of devas (Gods). They
<>are sinless. There are Ba1lakhilyas living in the lunar
<>region also. They worship the Sun daily. All the world
<>stand firm in truth because of the penance of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 141.). [Page102-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Garud2a (Eagle) who went
<>to the realm of devas (gods) for Amrta (amb-
<>rosia) took rest on the branch of a banyan tree, and
<>that branch was broken from the tree. Sixty thousand
<>Ba1lakhilyas were doing penance hanging head down-
<>wards on that branch. Garud2a knew this only after the
<>branch was broken. Fearing the curse form them he took
<>the branch in his beak and flew about here and there.
<>At last, according to the advice of Kas4yapa, he took the
<>branch to the mount Gandhama1dana and without caus-
<>ing any harm to the small hermits placed it there.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>(2) When Dus2yanta entered the hermitage of Kan2va
<>he saw the Ba1lakhilyas doing panance, hanging down
<>on the trees in the vicinity. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 7).
<NI>(3) In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 51, it
<>is mentioned that the Ba1lakhilyas were engaged in
<>prayer and meditations and offering oblations to fire
<>in the hermitage of Vasis2t2ha.
<NI>(4) It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 51, that in the period of the Ra1ma1yan2a, in
<>South India, when Ra1van2a was going to the house of
<>Ma1ri1ca, he saw the Ba1lakhilyas doing penance.
<NI>(5) The Ba1lakhilyas learned the Vedas and S4a1stras
<>(scriptures) sitting in the chariot of the sun. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<HI>BA1LAKHILYA SAM3HITA1. See the word Guruparam-

<HI>BALA1KI. (VALA1KI). One of the hundred sons of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra. Mention is made in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 2, that Vala1ki had been
<>present on the occasion of the svayam3vara (wedding)
<>of Draupadi1.
<HI>BA1LA1KI. A hermit. He is called Ga1rgya also as he is
<>a son of Garga. He acquired much knowledge and so
<>he became arrogant. Because of this some called him
<>Dr2ptaba1la1ki.
<NI>Once the hermit went to the King of Ka1s4i1 and told him
<>that he would impart to him the knowledge of Brahma.
<>The king replied that he would give thousand cows in
<>return. Ba1la1ki declared that the sun-god was Brahma1.
<>The king said that he had known it. Everything that
<>Ba1la1ki said had been known to the king earlier.
<>So, in the end Ba1la1ki had to become the disciple of the
<>King. Then the King took him to a man who was sleep-
<>ing. The King called the sleeping man. But he did not
<>wake up. The King woke him up and then asked the
<>hermit, where he had gone when he was sleeping. Ba1la1ki
<>could not say where men go when they are sleeping
<>and where they return from when they wake up. The
<>king said “In our sleep we attain ‘Sa1ru1pya’ (assimila-
<>tion to god). But we are not aware of it. Though
<>we get eternal bliss we do not know it. If we can get
<>eternal bliss when we keep awake that is ‘A1tmajn5a1na’
<>(knowledge of Supreme Soul). As the flames emanate
<>from fire, and as the spider weaves its net and sits in its
<>centre, the soul creates everything, controls everything
<>and pervades everything.” (Br2hada1ran2yakopanis2ad).
<HI>BALA1KS2A. An ancient king of Bha1rata. While the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were living incognito in the kingdom of Vira1t2a,
<>Duryodhana and his brothers stole the cows of Vira1t2a,
<>in consequence of which there was a battle. The devas
<>(gods) came in planes to see the fight between Arjuna
<>and the teacher Kr2pa. It is mentioned in the Maha1- [Page102-b+ 64]
<>bha1rata, Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56, that the King Bala1ks2a
<>was there with the gods when they came to see the fight.
<HI>BALAMITRA. A king. S4atrughna who led the ya1ga
<>horse of S4ri1 Ra1ma fought with Vi1raman2i and at that
<>time Balamitra fought on the side of Vi1raman2i. (Chapter
<>40, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BALAMODAKA. The son of Suratha, the King of
<>Kun2d2alanagari1. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 40).
<HI>BALA1NI1KA (VALA1NI1KA) I. A son of the King
<>Drupada. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 156, that As4vattha1ma1 killed him in the
<>battle of Kuruks2etra.
<HI>BALA1NI1KA (VALA1NI1KA) II. A brother of Matsya,
<>the King of Vira1t2a. During the battle of Kuruks2etra
<>he had taken the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and had fought
<>against the Kauravas. (M.B., Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>158).
<HI>BA1LASVA1MI1. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.B., S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 74).
<HI>BA1LA1VATI1. The daughter of hermit Kan2va. She did
<>penance to please the Sun to obtain a husband of a
<>very good nature. The Sun appeared before her and gave
<>her some dates and asked her to prepare food with them
<>and bring them back. Ba1la1vati1 began to cook the dates.
<>Though all the faggots she had gathered were consumed
<>it was not properly boiled. As there was no more fire-
<>wood she put her leg into the oven. Seeing this the Sun-
<>God was pleased and said “All your wishes will be
<>realized”. From that day onwards that place was called
<>by the name ‘Ba1la1pa’. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 152).
<HI>BA1LAVINAS2T2AKA. The hero of a story, given in Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka, Taran3ga six, to show
<>that it is not good to make others angry. The story is
<>as follows:--
<NI>Long ago there was a Brahmin named Rudra S4arma1.
<>He had two wives. Both gave birth to a son each. The
<>elder wife died and her son also was brought up by the
<>younger wife. Being jealous she fed the child with food
<>too hard for the child and it became lean with stomach
<>swollen and the bones projecting. It looked an uncouth
<>figure. Seeing him like this Rudra S4arma1 called him Ba1la-
<>vinas2t2aka (one who is lost when he is a boy). He
<>gradually grew up. When he was only five years old he
<>showed extraordinary intelligence. One day he decided
<>to teach his foster-mother a lesson. On that day he was
<>sitting alone on the lap of his father. He said to his
<>father, “Father, I have two fathers”. Thenceforward the
<>father began to doubt his wife, that she was having a
<>lover. He grew jealous. He would not talk to her. The foster-
<>mother thought Ba1lavinas2t2aka was the cause for this
<>change in her husband's behaviour. One day she called
<>the boy to her mildly and asked him for the reason for
<>the change in the behaviour of his father towards her.
<>He said that he would bring about a change in the beha-
<>viour of his father if he would be cared for properly.
<>She agreed. Then he took a mirror and held it before
<>his father and when the reflection of his father fell in
<>the mirror he said, “Father, I have two fathers”. Imme-
<>diately the doubt of his father was removed. It is not
<>right to make even a boy angry.
<HI>BA1LA1YANI. An a1ca1rya (Teacher). In Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10, it is seen that Ba1la1yani was taught Ba1la-
<>khilya sam3hita1 by Ba1s2kala. [Page103-a+ 65]
<HI>BA1LAYOGI1. A king of the An3ga dynasty. He was the
<>son of Bali, who had six sons named An3ga, Van3ga,
<>Kalin3ga, Pun2d2ra, Ba1leya and Ba1layogi1. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 277).
<HI>BALA1YUS. One of the eight sons born to Puru1ravas by
<>Urvas4i1. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i, Chapter 12).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA. (BA1LHIKA) I. A powerful king born in
<>the family of Ahara. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 67,
<>Stanza 25).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA II. A king who in his previous life was the
<>asura called Krodhavas4a. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter 96, Stanza 12, that
<>this King helped the Kauravas in the battle of Kuruk-
<>s2etra.
<HI>BA1LHI1KA III. A king who was the third son of Janame-
<>jaya and the grandson of King Kuru. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Stanza 56).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA IV. A son of Prati1pa, a King of the Kuru
<>dynasty. He had two brothers, Deva1pi and S4antanu. It
<>is said in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 94 that
<>Sunanda1, the princess of the country of S4ibi was their
<>mother. Mention is made in Bha1gavata, Skandha 9,
<>Chapter 22, Stanza 18 that this king Ba1lhi1ka had a son
<>named Somadatta. Ba1lhi1ka was a friend of the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. Ba1lhi1ka exhorted them strongly, not
<>to engage in a battle. Still, when the battle was begun,
<>Ba1lhi1ka sided with the Kauravas. Ba1lhi1ka was once
<>elected as the general of eleven divisions of the army
<>of Dury odhana.
<NI>The achievements of Ba1lhi1ka in the battle of Kuruks2etra
<>are given below:--
<NI>1) There was a combat on the first day of the battle
<>between Ba1lhi1ka and Dhr2s2taketu. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Stanza 38).
<NI>2) Bhi1masena defeated Ba1lhi1ka. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 104, Stanza 26).
<NI>3) Fought with Drupada. (Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Stanza 18).
<NI>4) Ba1lhi1ka fought with S4ikhan2d2i1. (Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 96, Stanza 7).
<NI>5) Bhi1masena killed Ba1lhi1ka. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>157, Stanza 15).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA V. The charioteer of Dharmaputra. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 58, Stanza 20).
<HI>BA1LHI1KADES4A. A country in ancient Bha1rata. Mention
<>is made about this country in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9.
<HI>BALI (MAHA1BALI) I. An emperor of the Asuras. He
<>was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahla1da.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} The Asuras or the Daityas are
<>the sons born, of his wife Diti, to Kas4yapa Praja1pati, son
<>of Mari1ci and grandson of Brahma1. There were so
<>many Asuras born as the sons of Diti. But among them
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a, Hiran2yakas4ipu, S4u1rapadma1, Sim3havaktra,
<>Ta1raka1sura and Gomukha were notorious. Of their
<>sisters Sim3hika1 and Ajamukhi1 were famous.
<NI>Four sons called Prahla1da, Sam3hra1da, Hra1da and
<>Anuhra1da were born to Hiran2yakas4ipu. Virocana was
<>the son of Prahla1da and Maha1bali was the son of Viro-
<>cana. Ba1n2a was born from Maha1bali and four crores of
<>Asuras called Niva1takavacas were born from Ba1n2a.
<NI>2) {%The churning of the ocean.%} Once Maha1bali had stolen
<>the wealth of Devendra. While he was carrying it to
<>his house, it all fell in the ocean. Maha1vis2n2u ordered
<>the devas (gods) to recover the lost wealth from the [Page103-b+ 65]
<>ocean. It was impossible to churn the ocean without
<>the help of Maha1bali. So the devas went to Maha1bali
<>and sought his help. Maha1bali agreed to help them.
<NI>The real aim of the devas was not to regain the lost
<>wealth but to obtain the celestial nectar known as Nectar
<>of Immortality (Amr2ta) and to defeat the Asuras in
<>battle. On the side of the Asuras there was the know-
<>ledge of the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 (life-restoring remedy). So
<>the dead were being brought to life. But it was not
<>possible for devas to do so. It was to make up this
<>deficiency, by obtaining Ambrosia from the sea, that
<>the devas tried to churn the sea, under the pretence of
<>recovering the lost wealth. Mention is made in the
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 9 and Matsya Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 250 and 251 that these events took place
<>during the regime of the Indra named Mantradruma in
<>the Ca1ks2us2amanvantara (the period of the manu named
<>Ca1ks2us2a).
<NI>3) {%War with Indra.%} The great teacher S4ukra again
<>anointed Bali, who was brought to life again, as Indra.
<>After that he performed the sacrifice of Vis4vajit (con-
<>queror of the world) on behalf of Bali. Assuming the
<>responsibilities of government, Bali performed one
<>hundred As4vamedha ya1gas (Horse sacrifices) (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 8).
<NI>After the Vis4vajit sacrifice, Yajn5adeva (god of sacrifice)
<>who was greatly pleased at the sacrifice, presented Bali
<>with a divine chariot, equal in all aspects to that of
<>Indra, a golden bow, two quivers, which would never
<>become empty and a divine armour, and his grand-
<>father gave him a garland that would never fade, and
<>the teacher S4ukra gave him a divine conch, and Brahma1
<>presented a garland. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 216).
<NI>4) {%Attainment of the Position of Indra.%} Maha1vis2n2u had
<>not been on good terms with the devas, for a time.
<>Taking this opportunity, S4ukra1ca1rya the teacher of the
<>Asuras, persuaded Bali to engage the devas in a battle.
<>Bali defeated the devas completely in a pitched battle.
<>Thus the realm of the gods came under the sway of
<>Maha1bali. Once, during that period Bali invited his
<>grandfather Prahla1da to heaven and requested him to
<>accept the most honourable seat there. Prahla1da
<>accepted his invitation and anointed Bali as Indra. Bali
<>enquired of Prahla1da as to the method of carrying on
<>the government of heaven. Prahla1da said thus in reply:
<>“Only virtue will always win. Rule the kingdom without
<>deviating from virtue.” (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 74).
<>Because Bali had ruled his kingdom according to the
<>advice of Prahla1da, he became famous in the three
<>worlds. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 75).
<NI>According to the version of Bha1gavata, Prahla1da when
<>he grew old, left his kingdom in the hands of his son
<>Virocana and went to the forest for penance. Virocana
<>was not as famous as Prahla1da. After the period of
<>Virocana, Maha1bali came to the throne. He was a
<>mighty king. Within a short time he became the emperor
<>of the Asuras. It was during this period that the churn-
<>ing of the Milk Sea took place. The Asuras and the
<>Devas (gods) sat on either side and using the mount
<>Mandara as churn-drill, churned the Milk Sea and
<>obtained Amr2ta (the celestial nectar of immortality).
<>A battle took place between the Asuras and the Devas
<>for the possession of Amr2takalas4a (the Ambrosia and
<>the container) and the emperor Maha1bali was killed in
<>the battle. The Asuras carried the dead body of Maha1. [Page104-a+ 65]
<>bali to his capital, where S4ukra1ca1rya (their teacher-pri-
<>est S4ukra) brought him to life again by the help of sacred
<>herbs. Maha1bali instantly waged another war, fiercer
<>than the previous ones, with the devas, and having
<>defeated them, he drove them out of their realm and
<>brought it under control. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>5) {%The curse of Prahla1da.%} As the whole of heaven came
<>under the sway of Bali, the devas began to leave the
<>country one by one. Everybody was happy and comfort-
<>able under the rule of Bali. But the devas and Bra1h-
<>man2as were denied the privileges they deserved. They
<>approached Vis2n2u and represented their grievances.
<>Vis2n2u told them thus: “Bali is devoted to me. Still, to
<>redress your grievances I shall take the incarnation of
<>Va1mana shortly.”
<NI>In course of time the Asuras and their countries began
<>to be weakened. Seeing the approach of destruction
<>emperor Bali became thoughtful. He approached
<>Prahla1da to learn the reason. Prahla1da told Bali thus:
<>“Lord Vis2n2u is now staying in the womb of Aditi for his
<>incarnation as Va1mana. That is why the country and
<>the Asuras are subjected to destruction. Hearing this
<>Maha1bali said: “Our Ra1ks2asas are more powerful
<>than that Vis2n2u.” Hearing these haughty words of
<>Bali, Prahla1da got angry and cursed Bali “Let your
<>country be destroyed.” Bali requested Prahla1da to
<>pardon him. Prahla1da advised Bali “You will get sal-
<>vation only by relying on Vis2n2u”. (Va1mana Pura1n2a 77).
<NI>6) {%Defeated by Va1mana.%} The defeated devas had taken
<>refuge in forests. Aditi the mother of the devas was
<>very sorry at this. She shed tears before her husband
<>Kas4yapa Praja1pati, who advised his wife to take a fast
<>of twelve days, and taught her the rules and rituals of
<>the fast. Accordingly she took the fast, Vis2n2u appeared
<>before her and asked her what boon she wanted. She
<>requested Vis2n2u to take birth as her son, to drive away
<>Bali and to restore her sons, the devas (gods), to their
<>kingdom of heaven. Maha1vis2n2u agreed.
<NI>Aditi became pregnant and gave birth to the son
<>Va1mana. He was an incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. [The
<>5th incarnation (avata1ra) of Vis2n2u].
<NI>At this time Maha1bali was performing a sacrifice on the
<>bank of the river Narmada1. Va1mana came to the place of
<>sacrifice in the dress of a hermit boy and told Maha1bali
<>that he was a helpless hermit boy and requested that
<>he might be given three steps of ground. Maha1bali
<>was pleased with the boy and told him that he was
<>willing to give the boy even the country called Bhr2n3ga1-
<>raka and that he was prepared to forego the kingly
<>pleasures for the boy. The hermit boy did not show any
<>desire for them. So many gathered round them to
<>witness this sight. The teacher S4ukra1ca1rya called Maha1-
<>bali and said that the boy was a cheat and that his
<>request should not be granted. But Maha1bali decided
<>to grant the wish of the boy and as a token of his gift
<>he began to offer the boy water from a waterpot. Then
<>the teacher got into the mouth of the pot in the shape
<>of a mote and water would not flow freely out of the
<>mouth of the pot. Knowing this Va1mana took a grass
<>of Darbha and pushed it at the mouth of the pot. The
<>grass pierced one eye of S4ukra1ca1rya. From that time
<>onwards S4ukra1ca1rya had only one eye. Water flowed
<>freely into the hands of Va1mana. S4ukra got angry and
<>cursed Bali. Va1mana began to measure the ground
<>and simultaneously began to grow. The asuras who were [Page104-b+ 65]
<>horrified at this, began to attack Va1mana with anything
<>they could lay hands on. Still Va1mana was growing.
<>Finally he became an immensely large being. With
<>one step he measured the whole of earth and with the
<>second step he took the whole of heaven. Then he
<>asked Bali, where to place the third step. Maha1bali
<>said that he had only his body left, as his own, and
<>that Va1mana might take it and complete three steps.
<>Va1mana placed his foot on the head of Bali and pushed
<>him down to Pa1ta1la (the Netherworld). Thencefor-
<>ward the asuras became the inhabitants of Pa1ta1la.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>7) {%Bali and Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a visited Bali who
<>was under custody in Pa1ta1la, and said to him, “I have
<>come to save you from here. So get yourself free from
<>the custody of Maha1vis2n2u, with my help.” Hearing
<>this, Bali asked Ra1van2a to fetch the two earrings of
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu, which were shining like blazing fire
<>a little away from them. Ra1van2a moved forward to
<>take them. But he fell unconscious. Bali caused him to
<>recover and said: “These earrings were worn by my
<>great grandfather Hiran2yakas4ipu. How could you,
<>who are not even capable of taking his earrings, save
<>me from his slayer, Vis2n2u? Vis2n2u is Almighty and
<>All-powerful and Supreme Lord of everything.” Hear-
<>ing this, Ra1van2a was filled with shame and he returned.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Uttara Ka1n2d2a, Praks2ipta Sarga).
<NI>8) {%Bali born as a Gardabha (Ass).%} Bali, who was fallen
<>from power took birth in the womb of an ass and
<>roamed about. Brahma1 instructed Indra to find out
<>Bali. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 216-218).
<NI>9) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) Maha1bali shines in the durbar of Varun2a. (M.B.,

<NI>(2) Once Maha1bali went to Prahla1da and repented of
<>his sins and begged for pardon. Then he began to make
<>enquiries on spiritual matters. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 28, Stanza 3).
<NI>(3) From his childhood Maha1bali was a hater of the
<>Bra1hmanas. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 90, Stanza
<>24).
<NI>(4) Once Maha1bali was engaged in a serious contest
<>with Indra. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 223).
<NI>(5) After having lost his kingdom Maha1bali ridiculed
<>Indra in various ways. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter

<NI>(6) Once Maha1bali talked with S4ukra1ca1rya about
<>giving gifts of flower, smoke and light. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 98, Stanza 15).
<NI>(7) Laks2mi1 Devi1 had forsaken Maha1bali because he

<HI>BALI II. A hermit. It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 10, that this hermit
<>lived in Hastina1pura.
<HI>BALI III. An incarnation of S4iva. S4iva incarnated in
<>the hermitage of the Ba1lakhilyas in the mount of
<>Gandhama1dana during the period of Vara1ha Kalpa
<>(Kalpa--one day of Brahma1 or the period of 14
<>manus). It is seen in S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a
<>that Bali had four sons, called Sudha1ma1, Kas4yapa,
<>Vasis2t2ha and Virajas. [Page105-a+ 65]
<HI>BALI IV. A king of the Ya1davas. He was the son of
<>Kr2tavarman. Bali married Ca1rumati1, the daughter of
<>Rukmin2i1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<HI>BALI V. A famous monkey-king of the country of A1nava.
<>This King who was the son of Sutapas was a contem-
<>porary of the great King Sagara.
<NI>Bali did penance and Brahma1 appeared before him,
<>and blessed him and said, “You will become a great
<>sage and will live till the end of the Kalpa (a period
<>of world age). Your power will be inimitable. Nobody
<>will overthrow you in battle. You will be loved by
<>your subjects and they will obey you. You will be well-
<>versed in the knowledge of law and its observance and
<>the learned will recognize your knowledge. You will
<>re-establish caste system in your kingdom.” (Harivam3s4a,
<>1. 31.35.39).
<NI>Sudes2n2a1 was the wife of Bali. The couple had no children.
<>At last they appealed to Di1rghatamas a hermit, from
<>whom they got five sons called An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Pa1n2d2u and Suhma (Brahma Pura1n2a). In Bha1gavata
<>it is mentioned that he had one more son called
<>Andhra.
<NI>Bali left his body at the end of the Kalpa and entered
<>heaven. Before his death he had divided his kingdom
<>equally among his sons. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 92).
<HI>BA1LI. A mighty monkey-king.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Ba1li is the son of Indra. There is a story
<>about the birth of Ba1li as follows:--
<NI>S4i1lavati1 who was devoted to her husband once carried
<>her husband Ugratapas who was a leper, on her shoul-
<>der to the house of a harlot one night. On the way
<>they saw the hermit An2ima1n2d2avya, who had been
<>placed on a trident by the order of the King, beating
<>his limbs with agony. Lying on the trident he saw
<>Ugratapas. Seeing the amorous nature of Ugratapas
<>An2ima1n2d2avya cursed him that before sunrise he would
<>die. S4i1lavati1 who was a woman of great purity and
<>loyalty hearing the curse said, “Let the Sun not rise
<>tomorrow.”
<NI>Next day, though it was time the sun did not rise. The
<>night prolonged. Arun2a the charioteer was ready at the
<>usual time but saw the Sun sitting motionless. Wast-
<>ing time was intolerable to the charioteer. So he decid-
<>ed to make the best use of the time at his disposal by
<>witnessing a little of the dance of the celestial beauties
<>in the realm of the devas. But males had no admittance
<>there. So Arun2a took the shape of a beautiful woman
<>and got in. Seeing a new person, very beautiful to
<>look at, sitting in the midst of the celestial maids Indra
<>grew amorous. He secretly took her to a dark place
<>and a son was born out of that coition. That son is Ba1li.
<>When Arun2a returned the Sun was standing full of
<>anger. Being afraid of him Arun2a confessed everything
<>to the Sun. When he heard the whole story the Sun
<>expressed his desire to see that figure which Arun2a had
<>adopted. Accordingly Arun2a again became a woman.
<>The Sun also had coition with her and Sugri1va was
<>the son born out of this coition. Ba1li and Sugri1va
<>were brought up by Ahalya1devi1 in the hermitage of
<>Gautama.
<NI>At that time a monkey-king named R2ks2ara1ja had been
<>ruling over the forest with Kis2kindha as his capital.
<>He had no sons and so he approached Indra and placed
<>before him his grievances. Indra brought Ba1li and [Page105-b+ 65]
<>Sugri1va from the hermitage of Gautama and handed
<>them over to R2ks2arajas. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 107;
<>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 42; Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a
<>and Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Marriage and Kingship.%} Owing to difference of opini-
<>on, Ba1li defeated the asuras who came for the churning
<>of the Sea of Milk. The devas who were pleased at
<>this, gave Ba1li, a woman named Ta1ra1, derived from
<>the Sea of Milk. Thus Ta1ra1 became his wife and he got
<>a son by her, named An3gada who became famous as a
<>mighty warrior-prince. Sugri1va married Ruma1. At that
<>time R2ks2ara1ja died and Ba1li became King. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Enmity with Hanu1ma1n.%} It was during this period
<>that Hanuma1n was born. While S4iva and Pa1rvati1 were
<>living in the forest as monkeys Pa1rvati1 got with child.
<>The child was given to Bhagava1n Va1yu (Wind-God)
<>with the womb. Va1yu placed the womb with the child
<>in An5jana1 Devi1's stomach. Na1rada informed Ba1li all these
<>things. Ba1li thought that his position would be lost, if
<>a being born of S4iva, grew up in the form of a monkey.
<>In accordance with the advice of Na1rada, Ba1li melted
<>Pan5caloha (Five metals) and passed it into the womb
<>of An5jana1. Still the child in the womb was not killed
<>as it was the sperm of S4iva. The molten metals became
<>earrings of the child in the womb. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Sugri1va separated.%} Once, the son of Maya, the car-
<>penter of the asuras, wanted to defeat Ba1li by a
<>combat or cunning sleights as he was an expert wrest-
<>ler and magician. He came to Kis2kindha1 in the mid-
<>night and standing before the palace, challenged Ba1li,
<>who getting angry came out followed by Sugri1va. See-
<>ing the two of them the magician began to run. Ba1li
<>and Sugri1va chased him to a cave. Placing Sugri1va at
<>the mouth of the cave Ba1li followed the magician. Be-
<>fore going, Ba1li said to Sugri1va: “Brother, I will go in
<>and kill the Magician and return. Be brave and stay
<>here. If the asura dies milk will appear at the mouth
<>of the cave and if he kills me blood will be seen. If the
<>latter happens close the mouth of the cave firmly and
<>return to Kis2kindha1 and live happily there.”
<NI>Ba1li did not return even after a year. Finally the asura
<>was killed. But by the cunning sleights of the magician
<>it was blood that appeared at the mouth of the cave.
<>Thinking that his brother was slain by the magician
<>Sugri1va felt sorry. Then he closed the mouth of the cave
<>firmly with stone and returned to Kis2ki1ndha1. Hearing
<>about the death of Ba1li the monkeys anointed Sugri1va
<>as King. After a time Ba1li returned stronger than before
<>and saw the mouth of the cave closed. He thought that
<>Sugri1va had closed the mouth of the cave deliberately
<>to kill him and to usurp his throne. Ba1li reached
<>Kis2kindha1 and drove Sugri1va away. S4ugri1va fled to
<>Mount R2s4yamu1ka1cala which was prohibited area for
<>Ba1li due to a curse. Ma1tan3ga had cursed him that if
<>he entered that mountain his head would be broken.
<>So Sugri1va was safe in that mountain.
<NI>The desire of Ba1li to take revenge on Sugri1va increased
<>everyday. Everyday he used to go to the four sea-
<>shores and conduct bath, prayer, meditation etc. and
<>return to Kis2kindha1 within a short time. With one
<>jump he will reach one place from another, and in
<>each jump he would put one step on the head of
<>Sugri1va in the R2s4yamu1ka1cala. Hanuma1n was the [Page106-a+ 65]
<>minister of Sugri1va. He was much annoyed at this
<>habitual torture of Sugri1va. One day as usual Ba1li
<>was stepping on the head of Sugri1va to jump to another
<>place, when Hanuma1n caught hold of Ba1li by his waist.
<>Hanuma1n thought that if Ba1li was dragged down on
<>the mountain somehow or other, his head would break
<>and there would be an end of his wicked deeds. Ba1li
<>thought that if he could jump into Kis2kindha1 with
<>Hanuma1n it would be easy for him to destroy Sugri1va.
<>But both were of equal strength. So Ba1li1 did not jump
<>with Hanuma1n to Kis2kindha1 and Hanuma1n did not
<>drag Ba1li to the ground. Both did not know how to
<>stop the fight. At last they made a treaty. Ba1li agreed
<>to stop torturing Sugri1va and Hanuma1n agreed not to
<>cause any trouble to Ba1li. Both returned to their own
<>places. After that Sugri1va lived in R2s4yamu1ka1cala with
<>his ministers and Ba1li in Kis2kindha1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 10; Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>5) Ba1li was cursed by Ma1tan3ga the great hermit. See
<>the word Dundubhi para 4.
<NI>6) {%Defeating Ra1van2a.%} Ba1li had got a boon from the
<>Gods that he would get half the strength of his oppo-
<>nent who stood face to face with him in fight. This
<>power enabled Ba1li to defeat all his foes and bring the
<>countries in all directions under his sway. Ra1van2a heard
<>about this and decided to overpower Ba1li somehow or
<>other and approached Kis2kindha1. Ba1li knew this. His
<>minister, Ta1ran, went to Ra1van2a and told him about
<>the power of Ba1li and of the boon by which Ba1li got
<>half the strength of his opponent. When Ra1van2a heard
<>of this peculiar boon he decided to kill Ba1li. His idea
<>was to kill Ba1li by going behind him when he went to
<>the sea-shore to take bath in the morning.
<NI>Next morning Ba1li went to the eastern sea-shore and
<>began his prayer and meditation. Ra1van2a approached
<>Ba1li from behind and sat close to him. Perhaps the
<>idea of Ra1van2a might have been to take Ba1li by his
<>tail and beat him on the ground. Ba1li knew that
<>Ra1van2a was sitting behind him. But pretending that
<>he knew nothing put his long tail on the body of
<>Ra1van2a, and passed it lengthwise and breadthwise
<>through every part of his body and tied him like a
<>bundle of faggots, and made a jump into the air.
<>Within a short time he visited all the usual places and
<>reached Kis2kindha1. Seeing Ra1van2a hanging by the
<>tail of Ba1li, even the women folk laughed. Thus
<>Ra1van2a admitted defeat. Ba1li let him go unhurt.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>7) {%Death.%} After Si1ta1 had been stolen away Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a wandered about in the forest. Then
<>they met with Hanuma1n, who took them to his King
<>Sugri1va. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va entered into a treaty,
<>by which S4ri1 Ra1ma was to kill Ba1li and to restore to
<>Sugri1va his wife who was under the custody of Ba1li, and
<>to make him the King of Kis2kindha1, in return for
<>which Sugri1va and his men had to help S4ri1 Ra1ma to
<>find out and recover Si1ta1. In accordance with the con-
<>ditions of the treaty, S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va reached
<>Kis2kindha1, to confront with Ba1li. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sug-
<>ri1va had hit up on a plan, by which S4ri1 Ra1ma was to
<>shoot Ba1li down, when Sugri1va was engaged in boxing
<>with Ba1li. Sugri1va challenged Ba1li to a single combat.
<>Ba1li came out and a horrible boxing began between the
<>two. But Sri1 Ra1ma could not distinguish one from [Page106-b+ 64]
<>the other. Thier faces were so alike. Sugri1va, being
<>defeated, receded from fight. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va
<>returned to R2s4yamu1ka1cala. Surgi1va spoke ill of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. But S4ri1 Ra1ma revealed the truth, and Sugri1va
<>believed it. Next day morning both of them started for
<>Kis2kindha1 to kill Ba1li. S4ri1 Ra1ma had put a flower
<>garland around the neck of Sugri1va to distinguish him
<>from Ba1li. This time Ta1ra1 tried to the utmost to dis-
<>suade Ba1li from fighting. But without paying any heed
<>to her words Ba1li engaged Sugri1va in fighting. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma, sitting in ambush, instantly sent an arrow to
<>the breast of Ba1li who looked to the side from which
<>the arrow came. Before falling down, looking at S4ri1
<>Ra1ma Ba1li said “It is not right on the part of the King
<>of Ayodhya1 to have shot an arrow from ambush”.
<>Hearing that S4ri1 Ra1ma said, “If you see me face to face
<>you will become devoted to me. It is not right to kill
<>one's devotee. You are a friend of Ra1van2a, who as you
<>know, is my foe. If I let you alone Ra1van2a is likely to
<>get your help. Besides, you have a boon that you will
<>get half the strength of the foe who faces you, and as
<>such you cannot be killed by anybody in direct fight.
<>It is unavoidable for the safety of Sugri1va, for my
<>interest, for the protection of the world at large, and
<>for the preservation of law and order that you should
<>be killed. Was it not a violation of duty on your part
<>to steal the wife of Sugri1va?”
<NI>Ba1li fell down. Immediately Ta1ra1devi1 and An3gada
<>arrived there. Ta1ra1 spoke very harsh words to S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. At last Ba1li entrusted Ta1ra1 and An3gada with
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma and then he died. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Kis2kindha1ka1n2d2a).
<HI>BALI1HAM3. A dynasty of Ks2atriyas. It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74, Stanza 14
<>that there was a king named Arkaja in this dynasty.
<HI>BA1LIS4IKHA. A serpent born to Kas4yapa praja1pati
<>of his wife Kadru. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 35,
<>Stanza 8).
<HI>BALIVA1K. A hermit. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 14 that this hermit
<>had been a member of the durbar of Yudhis2t2hira.
<HI>BALLA1LA. Son of a Vais4ya named Kalya1n2a. From
<>childhood Balla1la was an ardent devotee of Gan2apati.
<>When he was a child he used to gather pebbles and
<>make a heap and then worship it, imagining it to be
<>Gan2es4a (Gan2apati).
<NI>His parents did not like this. They tried their best to
<>dissuade him from this habit. Once they tied him to
<>a tree and gave him severe cuts. But their attempts
<>were futile. One day an image of Gan2apati arose in
<>the place where the child used to worship. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a 1:2).
<HI>BALLAVA (VALLAVA). A country in Bha1rata. Men-
<>tion is made about this country in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9.
<HI>BALLAVA (VALLAVA). This is the pseudo-name
<>assumed by Bhi1masena, while the Pa1n2d2avas were living
<>in pseudonymity in the kingdom of Vira1t2a. In some
<>Pura1n2as this name is shown as ‘Valala’. (M.B., Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 1).
<HI>BALOTKAT2A1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 23).
<HI>BALVALA (VALKALA). An asura. This asura had
<>been tormenting the hermits of the forest of Naimis4a. [Page107-a+ 64]
<>This asura was killed by Balabhadrara1ma.
<F>*) In the original of Bha1gavata this name is given as Balvala. But in the Malayalam translation the name used is “Valkala”.</F> For
<>detailed story see para 6 of the word Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma.
<HI>BA1N2A (BA1N2ABHAT2T2A) I. A Sanskrit poet who lived in
<>the 7th century A.D. He was a member of the assem-
<>bly of emperor Hars2avardhana. ‘Hars2acarita’ (prose)
<>is the most important work of Ba1n2a. Though many of
<>the descriptions in this book contain exaggerations it
<>affords plenty of scope for investigation into the fea-
<>tures of ancient Sanskrit literature. He has mentioned
<>about Vya1sa, Bhat2t2a1ra-haris4candra, Sa1tava1hana,
<>Pravarasena, Bha1sa, Ka1lida1sa and such others.
<NI>Hars2acarita, in a sense, is a Romance. It is divided
<>into eight Ucchva1sas. From the first two or three
<>chapters informations could be had of Ba1n2abhat2t2a.
<>His mother Ra1jyadevi1 died when he was a little boy.
<>At the age of fourteen his father also died. After that
<>he arrived at the palace of Hars2a. The story of Hars2a-
<>carita begins with the death of Prabha1kara-Vardhana,
<>father of Hars2a. The Book ends with the story incom-
<>plete. Hars2acarita is the only historic prose work
<>available in Sanskrit.
<HI>BA1N2A II. A mighty and powerful Asura.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descended from Maha1vis2n2u in
<>the following order: Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu-Pr2ahla1da-Virocana-Maha1bali-Ba1n2a.
<NI>2) {%Getting a boon.%} Ba1n2a began his reign with the city
<>of S4on2itapura as his capital. Then he went to the
<>vicinity of the Hima1layas and began to do penance
<>thinking of S4iva. S4iva made his appearance and asked
<>him what he wanted. He requested that he should be
<>considered as the son of Pa1rvati1 and that he should be
<>given thousand hands so as to destroy all his enemies.
<>S4iva granted him the boon. From that day onwards
<>Pa1rvati1 considered him as the younger brother of
<>Subrahman2ya. He returned to his Kingdom and began
<>to reign.
<NI>3) {%Battle with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his fall.%} (See the word
<>Aniruddha).
<NI>4) {%Other information.%} (1) In the Pura1n2as Ba1n2a1sura is
<>often called by the name Maha1ka1la, which is the name
<>of an attendant of S4iva. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 20).
<NI>(2) S4ukra1ca1rya (the teacher of the Asuras) always
<>worked for the uplift of Ba1n2a. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 38, Stanza 29).
<NI>(3) In the Battle with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Ba1n2a was helped by
<>S4iva, Subrahman2ya, and the Gods like Agni (fire) and
<>others. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<NI>(4) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a cut down the thousand hands of Ba1n2a
<>with his Cakra1yudha (the wheel weapon). (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<NI>(5) Ba1n2a often stood under the cover of the mountain
<>of Kraun5ca and attacked the devas (gods). So once
<>Subrahman2ya had to cut the mountain Kraun5ca with
<>his arrows. (M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza
<>82).
<HI>BA1N2A III. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. Mention is
<>made about this Ba1n2a in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Stanza 67.
<NI>BA1N2A IV. An asura. During the regime of S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>this Asura fought against the King and his brothers. A
<>S4ivalin3ga had been consecrated in the throat of this [Page107-b+ 63]
<>asura. So it was not possible for Laks2man2a to defeat
<>him though he had fought with him for so many days.
<>Laks2man2a heard an etherial voice saying, “Unless and
<>until the image of S4ivalin3ga is removed from his throat
<>Ba1n2a could not be killed.” By the operation of arrows
<>Laks2man2a smashed the image of S4ivalin3ga in his
<>throat. With the same arrow he cut the throat of the
<>asura also and thus Ba1n2a was killed. (Kampa Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Uttara Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>BANDHUDA1YA1DA. A son who can claim to be a heir.
<>The Pura1n2as state about six different kinds of Bandhu-

<NI>2) {%Pran2i1ta.%} A son born to one's wife by the blessing
<>of any holy man.
<NI>3) {%Putrika1putra.%} Son of one's daughter.
<NI>4) {%Paunarbhava.%} A son born after a re-marriage.
<NI>5) {%Ka1ni1na.%} A son born before marriage.
<NI>6) {%Bha1n5ja.%} Son of one's sister. All these sons are

<HI>BANDHUMA1N. A king of the country of Videha.
<>(Chapter 6, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).
<HI>BANDHUMATI1. A lady attendant of Va1savadatta1,
<>wife of Udayana. (See {%Va1savadatta1%}).
<HI>BARBARA. A country of pura1n2ic fame. The people
<>living there were called Barbaras. They were consider-
<>ed as low caste people. There is also a statement that
<>these people were born of the sides of the cow, Nan-
<>dini1. (S4loka 37, Chapter 174, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>During the victory march of the Pa1n2d2avas Bhi1masena
<>conquered the Barbaras. Nakula also conquered these
<>people. (Chapter 32, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.). In the
<>Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a of Dharmaputra the Barbaras were
<>present with gifts.
<HI>BARBARIKA. Son of Maurvi1 born of Ghat2otkaca, son
<>of Bhi1ma. Skanda Pura1n2a gives the following details
<>about him.
<NI>Barbarika was a Yaks2a in his previous life. Once the
<>devas unable to bear the insufferable harm done to
<>them by the Da1navas approached Lord Maha1vis2n2u for
<>help and then the Yaks2a who was present there at that
<>time said with arrogance, “There is no need for Vis2n2u
<>to curb the activities of the Da1navas. I shall do it my-
<>self.” Hearing those arrogant words Brahma1 cursed
<>him saying that in his next life he would be killed by
<>Vis2n2u.
<NI>True to the curse the Yaks2a was born in his next life
<>as Barbarika, son of Ghat2otkaca. To lessen the force of
<>the curse Kr2s2n2a advised him to worship Devi1. At last
<>pleasing the goddess by the kindly help of a brahmin
<>named Vijaya Barbarika killed a demoness called
<>Maha1jihva and a demon of name Repalendra. The
<>bra1hmin further gave him a weapon named Vibhu1ti
<>which could split the vital centres of the body of an
<>enemy and said, “Use this weapon against the Kaura-
<>vas who oppose the Pa1n2d2avas.”
<NI>Once Barbarika defeated his grandfather Bhi1ma in a
<>battle and greatly grieved over the injury done started
<>to commit suicide. Then Devi1 appeared before him and
<>reminded him thus, “You will get salvation only if you
<>are killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and so desist from committing
<>suicide.” [Page108-a+ 65]
<NI>The great war started and Barbarika fighting on the
<>side of the Pa1n2d2avas started using his weapon Vibhu1ti.
<>He sent it against all excepting the Pa1n2d2avas, Kr2pa1-
<>ca1rya and As4vattha1ma1. He did not leave even Kr2s2n2a
<>alone and the weapon fell on the feet of Kr2s2n2a also.
<>Enraged at this Kr2s2n2a used his Sudars4ana Cakra and
<>cut off his head; at once Devi1 appeared and brought
<>him to life. After the great battle on the advice of
<>Kr2s2n2a Barbarika went and lived in Guptaks2etra.
<HI>BARHAN2A1S4VA. A king born of the dynasty of emperor
<>Pr2thu. Descending in order: Pr2thu-Vis4varandhi-Candra-
<>Yuvana1s4va-S4a1vanta-Br2hadas4va-Dhundhuma1ra (alias
<>Valaya1s4va)-Dr2d2ha1s4va-Haryas4va-Nikumbha and to
<>Nikum3bha was born Barhan2a1s4va and from him Kr2s4a1s4va-
<>Prasenajit-Yuvana1s4va-Ma1ndha1ta1. (Saptama Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>BARHIS. A devagandharva clan. These were born to
<>Kas4yapa praja1pati of his wife Pr2tha1. (Chapter 65, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BARHIS2AD(S). A class of Manes. It is mentioned in
<>Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20 that some classes of manes
<>such as Agnis2va1ttas, Barhis2ads, Anagnis, and Sa1gnis are
<>said to have derived from Brahma1. Brahma1 created two
<>different sets of Pitr2s, Agnis2va1ttas and Barhis2ads.
<>(Chapter 10, Am3s4am 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>These Barhis2ads who are members of the Yamasabha1 (coun-
<>cil of the God of Death) perform the ma1ntric rites for
<>the dead. The name brings into its fold the world of
<>the seven sacred sages also. (Chapter 208, S4a1nti Parva,
<>M.B.). It was through these Barhis2ads that Brahma1
<>taught Sa1tvatadharma to a brahmin who became well-
<>known later as Jyes2t2ha. (Chapter 34, S4loka 45, S4a1nti

<>he drank up the sea completely dry, and Varun2a shud-
<>dering with fear returned Bhadra1 to Utathya and pro-
<>fusely apologised. Thus ended the problem.
<HI>BHADRA1 VII. Verse 24, Chapter 7 of the Mausala

<>got himself sanctified.
<NI>King Vi1rasena, who was then ruling the Avanti king-
<>dom had earned ample sanctity by the performance of
<>seventeen As4vamedha ya1gas. The Deaths of King
<>Vi1rasena and Bhadraka took place on one and the same
<>day. Though Bhadraka was immoral in his life, he
<>went to heaven along with Vi1rasena after death as he
<>had taken the ma1gha bath. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara-
<>khan2d2a).
<HI>BHADRAKA1LI1. Another form of Pa1rvati1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Lord S4iva, on hearing about the self-
<>immolation in fire of his wife, Sati1 at the famous yajn5a
<>conducted by Daks2a rushed in all anger to the spot, [Page109-b+ 65]
<>and beat the earth with his matted hair, and there ensu-
<>ed two forces called Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1. This
<>Bhadraka1li1 was really Sati1 or Pa1rvati1 in another form.
<NI>2) {%Bhadraka1li1 and Kam3sa.%} There is a story in the Das4ama-
<>Skandha of Bha1gavata that Kam3sa took away from
<>the room in which Devaki1 had delivered S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the
<>child of Yas4oda1 by whom Kr2s2n2a had been replaced,
<>and dashed the child against a rock, and that the
<>child then escaped from his clutches and rose up to the
<>sky. That child was Bhadraka1li1 in another form. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 12).
<NI>3) {%Kampa, Lan3ka1laks2mi1 and Bhadraka1li1.%} Lan3ka1laks2mi1,
<>who was guarding the city of Lan3ka1, was the first to
<>prevent Hanuma1n from entering the city. Tamil
<>Pura1n2as aver that this Lan3ka1laks2mi1 was an incarnation
<>of Bhadraka1li1. Hanuma1n thrashed Lan3ka1laks2mi1 with
<>his left hand at which she vomitted blood and fell down
<>unconscious. On regaining consciousness remembrance
<>of the past occurred to her, and after thanking Hanuma1n,
<>who restored her to her former form, she returned to
<>Kaila1sa. She complained to S4iva that she could not
<>witness the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war. Then S4iva told her
<>thus:
<NI>“You go to the Dra1vid2a country and be put up in the
<>‘Svayambhu1lin3ga’ temple there. I shall be born there
<>as Kampa, compose the Ra1ma1yan2a in Tamil and get
<>conducted the dolls-play. Then you would be able to
<>enjoy the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma, especially the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a
<>war, both by hearing and seeing the same in better
<>manner than by actually seeing the war.
<NI>Bhadraka1li1 acted according to this bidding of S4iva.
<>There lived a great scholar named San3karana1ra1yan2a
<>close to the temple. His wife was Cin3ka1ravalli1. Lord
<>S4iva, as decided upon previously was born as the son
<>of Cin3ka1ravalli1, who had become a widow while she
<>was worshipping ‘Svayambhu1deva’ for the gift of a
<>child. But, Cin3ka1ravalli1, who feared scandal in her,
<>a widow, becoming a mother, forsook the child in the
<>temple precincts and left the place. One Gan2es4akaunta
<>sighted the orphan child, and took it to Jayappavallan,
<>the Kaunta chief. The Kaunta chief, who was without
<>children brought up the orphan child as though it had
<>been his own child. Since the child was recovered from
<>the foot of the flagstaff it was named Kampa. Kampa,
<>who was very intelligent even in his infancy, but lazy by
<>nature turned out to be a great scholar and good poet
<>in Tamil by the time he grew up to be a youth, and
<>he became, consequently a prominent member in the
<>‘poets’ assembly’ of King Cola. When to his name was
<>added the plural suffix ‘r’ as a token of great respect
<>he came to be known as Kampar.
<NI>Once King Cola asked Kampar and Ot2t2akku1tta another
<>member of the poets’ assembly to compose in Tamil
<>poetry the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma. The King's direction was
<>that. Ot2t2akku1tta should compose his poem upto the
<>incident, Setubandhana (building a bridge in the sea up
<>to Lan3ka1) and Kampar should write the story of the
<>war in his poem. Ot2t2akku1tta completed the task allotted
<>to him within six months. But Kampar had not attempt-
<>ed to write even a single line. Having been informed
<>about the matter the King ordered that the poem, Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a should be recited in the assembly the very next
<>day itself. Kampar, who began writing his poem the
<>same day with the object of completing it in the night
<>itself fell asleep without writing anything at all. When [Page110-a+ 65]
<>Kampar awoke early in the morning he saw a divine
<>form disappearing from his room, and exclaimed, “Oh!
<>mother! you have slipped away”. To this the divine
<>form replies, “Oh Kampar! I have finished writing”.
<>And, then the divine form vanished completely.
<NI>When Kampar got completely out of sleep and looked
<>about he found the Ra1ma1yan2a story fully written in
<>verse on his desk. Kampar inferred that the poem was
<>composed by S4a1rada1bhagavati1, the presiding deity of
<>learning and literature, and he was wonder-struck. He
<>recited the poem in the royal assembly, and the King
<>and others too were wonder-struck. And, afterwards,
<>according to the orders of the King the story of the war
<>(Yuddhaka1n2d2a Katha1) began to be exhibited as dolls-
<>play in the presence of the idol of the Devi1 in the
<>temple. Thus S4iva incarnated himself as Kampar,
<>recited the story of the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war in the temple,
<>and hearing it Bhadraka1li1 danced.
<NI>The above is the chief legend about Kampar.
<HI>BHADRAKA1LIPPA1T2T2U. (Pa1t2t2u = Song). Folk song very
<>popular in Kerala temples. The practice is to sing
<>songs in praise of Bhadraka1li1

<HI>BHADRAKARN2ES4VARA(M). A sacred place. He who
<>visits this place conducts worship will never have to
<>face ill fate. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 39).
<HI>BHADRAMATA1 (BHADRAMANA1). Daughter born to

<>daughters of Krodhavas4a1 are: Mr2gi1, Mr2gamanda1,
<>Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rddu1li1, S4veta1, Surabhi,
<>Surasa1 and Kadru. (Sarga 14, A1ran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>BHADRAMATI. A very poor brahmin. This brahmin
<>had six wives and two hundred and fortyfour daughters.
<>(Na1rada Pura1n2am).
<NI>Once, hearing the glory of Bhu1da1na (giving away land
<>free to the deserved) he was much impressed and from
<>then onwards he became filled with a strong desire
<>to give land free to the poor. He had no land of his
<>own. But he went to the king of Kaus4a1mbi1 and begged
<>for some land which when received was immediately
<>given as gift to poor brahmins. After that he went and
<>bathed in the Pa1pana1s4ana ti1rtha situated in the mount
<>of Ven3kat2a1cala. Bhadramati got salvation by this good
<>deed. (Skanda 2,1,10).
<HI>BHADRAS4A1KA. A name of Subrahman2ya. It is the figure
<>of Subrahman2ya in the shape of a goat that is known

<>the Vr2ddhaca1ran2as. By worshipping this tree the
<>men have become white and majestic and by drink-
<>ing a juice prepared from its leaves the women keep
<>themselves eternally young. Chapter seven of Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva says like this about this tree: “Ka1la1mra stands
<>towering miles high bearing flowers and fruits at all
<>times of the year. The Vr2ddhaca1ran2as worshipping it
<>are white, strong and majestic. The women drinking
<>its juice are lotus-complexioned, beautiful, Moonfaced, [Page110-b+ 65]
<>well versed in music and dance and having a life-span of
<>over a thousand years, remaining young all the time.”
<HI>BHADRASA1RA. A king in the region of Ka1s4mi1ra. His
<>only son, Sudharman, was very much devoted to S4iva
<>and spent most of his time worshipping him. The
<>father tried his best to withdraw his son from this ex-
<>cessive devotion but failed.
<NI>Then one day the great sage, Para1s4ara, came to the
<>King as his guest and the King then requested him to
<>make his son withdraw from his S4iva-worship. But
<>Para1s4ara then told him about the previous life of
<>Sudharma1 and consoling him persuaded the King to do
<>the ‘Rudra1bhis2eka’ (uninterrupted pouring of cold
<>water over an idol of S4iva) by himself. The king then
<>entrusted the state with his son and left for the forests
<>accepting an ascetic life. (Skandha Pura1n2a, 3.3.20-21).
<HI>BHADRASENA. A king. Udda1laka Mahars2i performed
<>a demoniac ya1ga to destroy this king. (S4atapatha-
<>bra1hman2a).
<HI>BHADRAS4RAVAS. A king whom the Pura1n2as extol as
<>having ruled Saura1s2t2ra in Dva1parayuga. At the forest
<>of Naimis4a sage Su1ta told the following story to explain
<>how Laks2mi1 (goddess of wealth) took her abode in the
<>houses of men.
<NI>Bhadras4rava1 (Bhadras4ravas) who was ruling Saura1s2t2ra
<>had seven sons and a daughter of his wife Suraticand-
<>rika1. The daughter was named S4ya1maba1la1. Once
<>truthful-S4ya1maba1la1 was sitting under a green-wood tree
<>with her playmates playing with diamonds and gold
<>sand when the goddess of wealth disguised as an aged
<>brahmin woman went to the gates of the palace and asked
<>for permission to see the queen, Suraticandrika1. The
<>sentries pressed for details about her and then she said
<>this: “My name is Kamala1. My husband is a man named
<>Bhuvana1s4va and we live in Dva1raka1. Your queen in her
<>previous birth was a Vais4ya woman. One day she quar-
<>relled with her husband and he beat her hard and then
<>crying loudly she ran out of the house. I met her and
<>when she told me her story I instructed her to observe
<>a Pun2yavrata (Fasting to any particular deity). She did
<>it willingly and as a result she acquired great wealth
<>and happiness.
<NI>One day the husband and wife died. Yama, the king
<>of Death, then sent his orderlies to bring before him
<>that couple who had always quarrelled with each other
<>while living. Bound by ropes the ghastly servants of
<>Yama were about to drag them to their land when the
<>angelic servants of Vis2n2u with the insignia of ‘S4am3kha-
<>Cakra-Gada1’ on their lapels arrived there and those
<>messengers of Laks2mi1 headed by Svapraka1s4a cut off the
<>ropes and carrying them in a Ra1jaham3sa chariot took
<>them through noble paths to the land of Laks2mi1. They
<>lived there happily for a period calculated at the rate of
<>a thousand years for one week of Pun2yavrata observed.
<>In the end to complete the goodness remaining they
<>were born as King and queen on earth with plenty
<>of wealth and happiness. But they have now forgotten
<>about the Pun2yavrata and I have come here to remind
<>them of it.”
<NI>The gate-keeper immediately went to her mistress and
<>told her all that happened. But the queen, Suraticand-
<>rika1 got angry when she heard the story and ordered
<>the old woman to be sent away from there with thrash-
<>es. The old woman ran away from the palace crying
<>loudly and S4ya1maba1la1 on hearing the cry went and [Page111-a+ 65]
<>enquired about the incident. On hearing the story
<>from the woman S4ya1maba1la1 got instructions regarding
<>that Pun2yavrata from the old woman and started
<>observing it. Within four weeks she got married and
<>went to her husband's house. After S4ya1maba1la1's depar-
<>ture from the palace the wealth of the King began to
<>wane and they became so poor that at the request of the
<>queen the King Bhadras4rava1 went to his daughter to ask
<>for help. The daughter gave his father a block of solid
<>gold drapped in a paper. But on his return to the
<>palace when he opened the bundle he found there a
<>block of charcoal instead of gold. On seeing the mis-
<>hap the king burst into a cry.
<NI>Suraticandrika1 then went to her daughter and was well
<>received and attended to. During her stay there the
<>Pun2yavrata day of the month came and the daughter
<>tried her best to make her mother also observe the
<>same. But the poverty-stricken queen broke the fast
<>without her daughter's knowledge by eating what re-
<>mained in the dishes of the children. But the next
<>month S4ya1maba1la1 compelled her mother to observe the
<>fast strictly and so Suraticandrika1 took the Vrata
<>successfully. A few days after that Suraticandrika1 re-
<>turned home and to her amazement found everything
<>in plenty there once more. (Chapter 11, Bhaga 2,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHADRAS4REN2YA. A Hehaya King who was ruling a
<>state with Ma1his2mati1 as capital. He had fought many
<>wars with Divoda1sa, king of Ka1s4i1. (See under Divo-

<>of Rahova1di. Bhadra1s4va1 had ten sons: R2ks2eyu, Kr2s2eyu,
<>Sannateyu, Ghr2teyu, Citeyu, Sthan2d2ileyu, Dharmeyu,
<>Sammiteyu, Kr2teyu and Matina1ra. (Chapter 278, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>Once Agastya went and stayed for seven days in the
<>palace of Bhadra1s4va and his wife Ka1ntimati1. Every-
<>day Agastya used to speak in glowing terms about
<>Ka1ntimati1 and asked about the reason for it he replied:
<>“In her previous birth Ka1ntimati1 was a servant girl in
<>a wealthy house. The master of the house once entrust-
<>ed her with the task of seeing that none of the temple
<>lights went out on the night of Dva1das4i1 in the month
<>of Tula1 (A1s4vina--October). She did her duty so
<>willingly and sincerely that she was born as a queen and
<>you a King”. Then Agastya gave them instructions
<>about that Vrata which both Bhadra1s4va and Ka1ntimati1
<>observed sincerely, receiving as a result benediction
<>from Vis2n2u. (Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHADRA1S4VA II. Agni1dhra, son of Priyavrata and
<>grandson of Manu, got nine sons of his wife Pu1rvacitti,

<NI>One day, while Bhadra1yu was ruling the country, S4iva
<>came in the guise of a tiger and carried away the wife
<>of a brahmin. Bhadra1yu, a firm protector of his sub-
<>jects gave his own wife to the brahmin and prepared
<>himself to give up his life in fire. S4iva greatly pleased
<>at this selfless act of Bhadra1yu befitting a true King
<>appeared before him and blessed him and gave back

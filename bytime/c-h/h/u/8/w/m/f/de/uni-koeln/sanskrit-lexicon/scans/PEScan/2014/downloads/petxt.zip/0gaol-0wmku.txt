<HI>BHAGAVAD GI1TA1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The Bhagavad Gi1ta1 is a poem consisting of
<>650 verses divided into eighteen chapters. The Gi1ta1
<>covers chapters 25-45 in the Bhi1s2ma Parva of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata, and it is in the form of a talk or discussion
<>between Arjuna and Lord Kr2s2n2a. The mighty armies
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas were arrayed on
<>opposite sides for mortal combat on the field of Kuru-
<>ks2etra when Arjuna, overcome by grief at the prospect
<>of fathers, brothers, preceptors and other Kinsmen
<>fighting and killing one another expressed to his
<>charioteer, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a his aversion to fighting. But, the
<>Lord pointed out to the unwilling Arjuna, by unique
<>and various arguments, his imperative duty, under the
<>circumstance, to fight and fight in heroic earnestness with
<>the result that Arjuna shed his disinclination to fight and
<>entered the fray, which ended in the ultimate victory
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. And the dialogue between Arjuna
<>and Kr2s2n2a, and especially the great teaching of Kr2s2n2a
<>on the field form the theme of the Gi1ta1. The Gi1ta1
<>contains three spheres or fields of teaching; the karma
<>yoga (philosophy of action), jn5a1na yoga (philosophy of
<>knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (philosophy of devotion).
<>The three yogas are treated each in six chapters.
<NI>The theme of the Gi1ta1 is philosophy, and it is revered
<>as one of the most sublime philosophical texts of the
<>Hindu religion. Many a great thinker and philosopher
<>like A1ca1rya S4an3kara, Ra1ma1nuja1ca1rya and Madhva1-
<>ca1rya have annotated, and written commentaries on
<>the Gi1ta1. There is a school of thought which believes
<>that the Gi1ta1 was taught to Arjuna by Kr2s2n2a himself
<>on the battle-field in something like tabloid form and
<>that Vya1sa eleborated the mighty teaching in its present
<>form. The poet, Ba1n2a, who flourished in the 7th
<>century A.D., and the great S4an3kara, who lived in the
<>8th century believed that the Gi1ta1 was sung by Kr2s2n2a
<>himself. But there are some modern thinkers, who
<>argue that the Gi1ta1 was composed some time between
<>the third and fourth centuries B.C. and it was inter-
<>polated into the Maha1bha1rata in the second century
<>A.D.
<NI>The Gi1ta1 has translations in all the languages of the
<>world. The whole world has acclaimed it as a very [Page113-a+ 65]
<>weighty and valuable contribution in the sphere of
<>philosophy.
<NI>2) {%Theme of the Gi1ta1.%} It has been mentioned above that

<NI>(For another story about the greatness of the Gi1ta1
<>see Dus4s4a1sana II).
<HI>BHAGAVATI1. The words Bhagava1n and Bhagavati1
<>mean Parama1tma1 (universal self) and Prakr2ti (Nature [Page113-b+ 65]
<>and its modifications) respectively. Prakr2ti is also
<>called by the name S4akti. The following elucidation
<>once given by Maha1vis2n2u about Bhagava1n and Bhaga-
<>vati1 is greatly illuminating.
<NI>Time, space, atmosphere and the universe (Brah-
<>ma1n2d2am) are, just like Parama1tma1, eternal. This is the
<>truth and reality. Below this eternal Gokula exists
<>Vaikun2t2haloka, which also is, like the former, eternal.
<>Just like this, Prakr2ti, which is a sport to Brahma1 and
<>is also without beginning or end (Sana1tani1) too is
<>eternal. In the same manner as flame exists in fire in-
<>separable from it, moonlight in moon, beauty in the
<>lotus flower and brightness in the sun, so does nature
<>exist in soul inseparable therefrom. In the same way
<>as the goldsmith cannot make gold ornaments without
<>gold and the potter cannot make pots without clay, the
<>Parama1tma1 will not in the least be able to function
<>unaided by Prakr2ti. Prakr2ti (Nature, Devi1) is all power-
<>ful. ‘Para’ becomes powerful enough to do everything
<>when he joins the Devi1.
<NI>The sound ‘S4a’ means welfare and good fortune, and
<>the sound ‘kti’ means prowess. Hence “S4akti” means
<>the embodiment of welfare and prowess or she, who is
<>the giver of welfare and prowess. Bhagavati1 combines
<>in herself knowledge, affluence, riches, fame and strength.
<>As the Parama1tma1 is always with and inseparable from
<>such Bhagavati1 he is called Bhagava1n also. When
<>Prakr2ti and Parama1tma1 remain combined it is called
<>Parabrahma, which possesses neither form nor attri-
<>butes. And, when Prakr2ti and Purus2a separate, of their
<>own accord, they assume forms and attributes.
<NI>The above is S4aiva doctrine in a nut-shell. The
<>Vais2n2avas do not accept this position. They ask, “How
<>is it possible to have brightness or effulgence without
<>there being an effulgent one?” Therefore, the Vais2n2avas
<>believe in the existence, at the centre of an effulgent
<>sphere, of a thing possessing the utmost effulgence and
<>brightness equal to that of Brahma1. This ‘thing’--
<>Deva--is very efficient and effective to remedy sorrows
<>due to birth, death, disease etc. and to him the life-
<>time of Brahma is just one minute only. This Deva is
<>called Parama1tma1, Parabrahma and Kr2s2n2a by the
<>Vais2n2avas. ‘Kr2s2’ means maximum devotion (love)
<>towards Parama1tma1, and ‘n2a’ means he who becomes
<>slave to such devotion. Hence Kr2s2n2a means he who
<>becomes a slave to the love of his devotees. There is
<>another meaning also for the word Kr2s2n2a. Kr2s2 means
<>all and ‘n2a’ means seed or root; and thus Kr2s2n2a means
<>he, who is the root of everything. In the very begin-
<>ning there was only this Kr2s2n2a; and this Lord, sub-
<>ject only to his own will and pleasure, divided him-
<>self into two, the left side becoming woman and the
<>right side man. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>BHAGINI. A word used in addressing women. Verse
<>129 in chapter two of the Manusmr2ti lays down that
<>the wife of another person and women who are not
<>one's relatives should be addressed either as Bhavati,
<>Subhage or Bhagini.
<HI>BHAGI1RATHA.

<F>*) According to verse 12, Chapter 25, of Vana Parva, Bhagi1ratha is the son of Dili1pa. But most of the Pura1n2as refer to him a
<>he son of Am3s4uma1n.</F>-Bhagi1ratha.
<NI>2) {%Recluse.%} Many years had not lapsed after his coro-
<>nation as King when, in the heart of Bhagi1ratha spiri-
<>tual thoughts began to crop up. A great sage called
<>Tritula was his guru. Once Bhagi1ratha asked the guru
<>what was the means to get rid of worldiy sorrows, and
<>the guru replied as follows:--
<NI>The ego will be annihilated when the tendencies and
<>cravings towards objects of the senses are absolutely
<>suppressed and the whole and perfect truth is realised
<>through knowledge, the practice of concentration etc.
<>The ego will not disappear as long as one does not
<>become one's real self by completely overcoming the
<>sense of pride, shame etc. which form the outer case
<>of worldly life. The egoless state is the ultimate
<>achievement and most supreme state. Oh! Bhagi1ratha!
<>if you would get rid of sentiments like pride etc., give
<>up all attachment to material objects, become fearless
<>and gift away, with thoughts concentrated on the inner
<>self, all your wealth to enemies, and then move among
<>those enemies, without any sense of ego and pride
<>about this material body, and take alms from them
<>(enemies) and also give up me, who am your preceptor
<>in the matter of knowledge; then you will become the
<>most sublime Brahma”. This advice of the guru
<>affected him so much that Bhagi1ratha, holding his
<>duties firmly in mind, engaged himself in spiritual
<>practices, and after spending some time thus he per-
<>formed, according to rules, the Agnis2t2oma yajn5a aimed
<>at gifting away everything. All wealth like cows, land,
<>horses, gold etc. were distributed in gifts to noble
<>brahmins and the poor folk according to their eligibi-
<>lity for the same. Within three days he had gifted away
<>everything except the clothes he was wearing. And,
<>then he invited his neighbouring enemy king and gave
<>to him, without the least hesitation, the kingdom which
<>had been bereft of all wealth. The ministers and other
<>citizens felt very sorry about the whole thing. But, Bha-
<>gi1ratha left the country at once for other places having
<>with him only the clothes he was wearing. He spent his
<>days in various places and forests where he was not
<>known even by name. Ere long, Bhagi1ratha attained
<>ultimate spiritual solace. And, then he accidentally
<>came to his former kingdom, which was then being
<>ruled by the enemy King. The ministers and other
<>citizens to whose houses he went begging for alms
<>recognised him, and with sorrow unbearable they
<>appealed to him to accept the throne again and rule
<>the country. Bhagi1ratha rejected their request, and,
<>after staying there for some time, he started for other
<>places. During this wandering of his he met his old
<>preceptor, Tritula, and both of them, in company,
<>toured for some time cities and forests. They felt it very
<>painful to keep on to their body like that. They
<>thought like this: “Why should the body be kept like
<>this. What if this material object continues to exist
<>or perishes? But let it (the body) continue as long as
<>it exists without in any way being against the order
<>of things and ethical practices”. And, in this frame of
<>mind they traversed the forests. Now, the minister of
<>a distant kingdom who was on the look out for a [Page114-b+ 61]
<>successor to the King who had died heirless, persuaded
<>Bhagi1ratha to accept the Kingship of that country. The
<>ministers of Bhagi1ratha's former Kingdom also now
<>requested him to resume his old kingship, especially
<>since its new ruler had already expired. Bhagi1ratha
<>obliged them, and became once again King of his own
<>country. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ham).
<NI>3) {%Bhagi1rathaprayatnam. (Hima1layan or Herculean effort).%}
<>Sagara, an old predecessor of Bhagi1ratha had two
<>wives called Kes4ini1 and Sumati. Kes4ini1 had one son
<>named Asaman5jas and Sumati 60,000 sons. Sagara
<>once conducted an As4vamedha yajn5a in the Indo-
<>Gangetic plane, when Indra stole away the sacrificial
<>horse and kept it quite near to sage Kapila who was
<>doing tapas in Pa1ta1la. The 60,000 sons of Sagara set
<>out in search of the horse and found it out in Pa1ta1la.
<>At the sight of the horse they shouted themselves
<>hoarse. Enraged at this sage Kapila reduced those sons
<>of Sagara to ashes in the fire which emanated from his
<>eyes.
<NI>After entrusting Asaman5jas with the duty of perform-
<>ing the funeral rites of his 60,000 sons Sagara expired.
<>Asaman5jas transferred that duty on to Am3s4uma1n, and
<>he to Bhagi1ratha. Bhagi1ratha did penance on the sea-
<>shore concentrating his mind on Gan3ga1devi1. The Devi1
<>appeared before Bhagi1ratha and asked him to choose
<>what boon he would, and he requested the Devi1 to per-
<>form the funeral rites of 60,000 sons of Sagara remain-
<>ing in the form of ashes in Pa1ta1la. To this Gan3ga1devi1
<>replied that the earth will not be able to withstand
<>the impact of her powerful flow, but she shall, if S4iva
<>permits, flow into his matted hair. And, Gan3ga1devi1
<>asked Bhagi1ratha to first get that permission. This did
<>not dishearten Bhagi1ratha, who went to mount Kaila1sa
<>to do penance so that S4iva might grant him his prayer.
<>He thus did penance for 1000 years. S4iva appeared to
<>him and agreed to receive the rushing flow of Gan3ga1
<>water on his matted head. And, accordingly S4iva stood
<>in position to receive the rushing waters of Gan3ga1, and
<>Gan3ga1 flowed on to his head. Even the most powerful
<>flow of Gan3ga1 water on his head did not cause S4iva to
<>move from his position even by a hair's breadth. This
<>awakened the conceit in Gan3ga1devi1, understanding
<>which S4iva contained her on his head. Without finding
<>any outlet the waters of river Gan3ga1 flowed along the
<>matted hairs of S4iva for thousand years. So, Bhagi-
<>ratha had once again to please S4iva. Thus pleased
<>again S4iva shook his matted head and one drop of
<>water fell on the ground, and that is the river Ganges
<>in North India. The Gan3ga1 flowed along plane ground
<>to Pa1ta1la and performed the funeral rites of Sagara's
<>sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 108; Va1lmi1ki

<HI>BHAIRAVA I. A na1ga belonging to the Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>Vam3s4a. There is a reference to this na1ga in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 17. He was
<>burnt up at the Sarpasatra performed by King Janame-
<>jaya.
<HI>BHAIRAVA II. A Pa1rs2ada of S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Immediately after his birth, this terrible
<>monster subdued all the Devas without getting the
<>permission of S4iva. Enraged at it, S4iva turned him into
<>a tree by a curse. But S4iva was soon pacified and lifted
<>the curse by declaring that those who offered pu1ja1 to
<>the gods would get the full reward for their worship
<>only if they offered pu1ja1 to Bhairava also.
<NI>Bhairava became a tree as soon as he was cursed. He
<>became a tree because he subdued the gods. Therefore
<>that tree came to be called “DAMANAKA” tree
<>(Damana = Subdue). It has another name. “TA1TIRI”
<>tree. Even now, pious people offer pu1ja1 to this tree.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapters 52-80).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Once Brahma1 and Vis2n2u became swollen
<>with pride. In his haughty way, Brahma1 insulted S4iva.
<>Under the insult, S4iva was infuriated and out of the
<>fire of his fury was born Bhairava with his black form.
<>(Lin3ga Pura1n2a 1.90).
<NI>3) {%Brahmahatya1.%} As soon as he was born, Bhairava
<>rushed towards Brahma1 and pinched off his fifth head
<>which had insulted S4iva. By this, he incurred the sin
<>of Brahmahatya1. For the expiation of this sin, as
<>ordered by S4iva, Bhairava started on a journey to go
<>abegging, with Brahma1's severed head in his hand.
<>S4iva then created a woman named “Brahmahatya1”
<>and asked her to follow Bhairava.
<NI>Although Bhairava visited many holy places, he was
<>not able to liberate himself from the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1. At last, at the suggestion of S4iva, he went to
<>Va1ra1n2asi1 and washed off his sin. Brahma1's head which
<>he carried, was also deposited there and the place be-
<>came famous under the name of “Kapa1lamocana
<>ti1rtha”. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atarudra Sam3hita1).
<NI>4) {%Family.%} In Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a there is an elaborate
<>account of the family of Bhairava. According to this
<>Pura1n2a, Vijaya, the reputed King of Va1ra1n2asi1 was born
<>in the family of Bhairava. Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a also says
<>that Vijaya destroyed the Kha1n2d2avi1 city and set up
<>the Kha1n2d2ava forest in its place.
<NI>According to Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a, Bhairava and Veta1la
<>were, in their previous births, two S4ivapa1rs2adas named
<>Maha1ka1la and Bhr2n3gi. It was by the curse of Pa1rvati1. [Page115-b+ 64]
<>that they were born as mortals in their next birth.
<>(Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a 53).
<NI>The Pura1n2as mention eight Bhairavas called Asita1m3ga,
<>Ruru, Can2d2a, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapa1li, Bhi1s2an2a and
<>Sam3ha1ra.
<NI>5) {%Shape.%} Bhairava has a terrible shape. He wears the
<>crescent moon and plaited hair on his head. His wea-
<>pons are, sword, arrow, dagger, bow, trident, rope
<>etc. At times he is dressed in elephant-skin. He has
<>five faces. Serpents are his ornaments. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 52-80).
<HI>BHAIRAVI1. One of the eight Ambas. They are:
<>Rudra1rcika1, Rudracan2d2i1, Nat2es4vari1, Maha1laks2mi1,
<>Siddhaca1mun2d2ika1, Siddhayoges4vari1, Bhairavi1 and
<>Ru1pavidya1. All these are the eight different forms of
<>Devi1. (See the word DEVI1).
<HI>BHAJAMA1NA. A Ya1dava King, whose father was Sat-
<>vata and mother Kausalya1, and they had, beside
<>Bhajama1na, another son called Satvata or Andhaka.
<>Bhajama1na married the two daughters of Sn5jaya,
<>named Ba1hyaka1 and Upaba1hyaka1 by whom he got six
<>sons. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>BHAJYA. An a1ca1rya in the line of the R2k disciples of
<>Vya1sa. Bhajya studied Va1lakhilyasam3hita1 at the feet of
<>his guru Ba1s2kali. (Bha1gavata, Dva1das4a Skandha).
<HI>BHAKS2AKA. A S4u1dra sinner. In Padma Pura1n2a the
<>following story is related about this S4u1dra.
<NI>Bhaks2aka who was once going aimlessly somewhere
<>felt extremely thirsty, and quenched his thirst by
<>drinking water which was found near the small plat-
<>form raised for the holy Tulasi1 shrub. The sanctity of
<>the water thus drunk washed away all the sin attached
<>to him. Some time later he was killed by a forest-
<>dweller, and he attained svargaloka (heaven). Bhaks2aka,
<>in his previous birth, was a king who led a voluptuous
<>life, and he, once, robbed a very beautiful woman of
<>her chastity, and it was as a punishment for the sin
<>that the King had to be born, in the next birth, in the
<>womb of a S4u1dra woman. (Padma Pura1n2a, Brahma
<>Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 22).
<HI>BHAKTI. A Devi1 born in Dra1vid2a des4a (Southern
<>India). Once Devi1, along with her two sons, Jn5a1na
<>and Vaira1gya, started on a walking tour to Gokula and
<>Vr2nda1vana via Karn2a1t2aka, Maha1ra1s2t2ra and Gurjara
<>(Gujarat). During the long tour the mother and her
<>sons became aged. But, as soon as they set foot on
<>Gokula and Vr2nda1vana old age quitted Bhakti and
<>she became young again. But, her sons remained old.
<>So the mother requested Na1rada to turn them young
<>again. Na1rada read out to them the Vedas, the
<>Veda1nta (Upanis2ads) and the Bhagavad Gi1ta1, all to no
<>purpose. Bhakti's sons still remained old. Then Sanaka,
<>Sananda and Sanatkuma1ra asked Na1rada to read out
<>the Bha1gavata to them. Na1rada did so, and the sons of
<>Bhakti1 Devi1 became young again. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHALANDANA. A king. Though by birth he was a
<>brahmin he became a Vais4ya because of doing things
<>belonging to the Vais4ya community like trade and
<>commerce. (Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a). According to the
<>Bha1gavata, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a and Va1yu Pura1n2a Bhalan-
<>dana was the son of Na1bha1ga.
<HI>BHALLA1TA. A king of the line of Bharata. He was the
<>son of King Vis4vaksena and father of King Br2hadas4va.
<>(Navama Skandha, Bha1gavata). [Page116-a+ 58]

<>ra's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 15).
<HI>BHA1LUKI II. A mahars2i. He also accompanied the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to Dvaitavana. (Vana Parva, Chapter 27).
<HI>BHA1LUKI III. An a1ca1rya. He was a disciple of La1n3gali,
<>a member of the Sa1ma line of disciples of Vya1sa.
<>(Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHA1MAHA. A critic who lived in the sixth century A.D.
<>He was one of the top critics in the Sanskrit language.
<>His important work is ‘Ka1vya1lam3ka1ra’. This is also
<>called Bha1maha1lam3ka1ra by a few. There are six chapters
<>in this. The first chapter deals with Ka1vyas4ari1ra, the
<>second and third with Alam3ka1ra, the fourth with Ka1vya-
<>dos2a the fifth with Nya1ya and the sixth with S4abdas4ud-
<>dhi. As against Dan2d2i1 Bha1maha separates ‘Katha1’ from
<>‘A1khya1yika1’. According to him the requisites of a good
<>Ka1vya are sweetness, pleasantness and liveliness. Dan2d2i1
<>prescribes ten attributes for a good Ka1vya. Bha1maha is
<>of opinion that Vakrokti is no alam3ka1ra at all. In
<>a wider sense it is ‘atis4ayokti’ (exaggeration). But
<>Bha1maha admits it has a place in Ka1vya.
<HI>BHA1MINI1. Wife of Aviks2it, King of Vais4a1li. The
<>famous Marutta is the son born to this couple. The
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a states that Bha1mini1 once went to
<>Na1galoka to give refuge to the serpents there.
<HI>BHA1NAVI1. A river. S4ri Ra1ma and Laks2man2a on their
<>way to the forests from Citraku1t2a crossed this river,

<>yan2a).
<HI>BHA1N2D2A1YANI. A mahars2i. This sage sits in Devaloka
<>and worships Indra. (S4loka 12, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva,

<HI>BHA1N2D2I1RA(M). An ancient forest. It was in this
<>forest situated in Am3ba1d2i that S4ri Kr2s2n2a with his cow-
<>herd chums conducted his childhood exploits. There
<>was a very huge tree of name Bha1n2d2i1ra in this forest
<>and it was under this great tree that Kr2s2n2a and his
<>friends met daily for their play. This forest is on the
<>northern bank of Gan3ga1 in front of Kes4ighat2t2a in
<>Vr2nda1vana. The Pura1n2as proclaim that it was here that

<HI>BHA1NUDATTA. A brother of S4akuni. In the Maha1-
<>bha1rata battle he fought against Bhi1ma and died.
<>(S4loka 24, Chapter 157, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).

<>the Ya1davas. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went with his retinue of
<>Ya1davas to visit the holy palace called Pin2d2a1raka the
<>Ya1davas conducted a wine festival. During that festi-
<>val a demon of the name Nikumbha carried away
<>Bha1numati1. This was because of a curse to Bha1numati1
<>from Durva1sas whom Bha1numati1 did not respect once
<>when they met at the garden of Raivata. Durva1sas had
<>after the curse consoled her by assuring her that she
<>would be saved and married by Sahadeva, one of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. True to this, Bha1numati1 was married to Saha-
<>deva in the presence of Na1rada and Kr2s2n2a. (Vis2n2u
<>Parva, Chapter 90).

<>battle by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 27, Chapter 48, Karn2a
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA I. Another name of Di1rghatamas.
<F>**) Di1rghatamas is also called Bharadva1ja. But the Bharadva1ja of pura1n2ic fame is not Di1rghatamas. Di1rghatamas is the son whom
<>Br2haspati illegitimately got of Mamata1, his brother's wife. There was then another legitimate child in the womb of Mamata1. Knowing this
<>the devas told her ‘Bharadva1ja’ meaning ‘bear the brunt of two’ and so the son of Br2haspati got the name of Bharadva1ja also. The real
<>name of this son was Di1rghatamas or Vitatha. Di1rghatamas is not the Bharadva1ja who was the father of Dron2a. The famous Bharadva1ja
<>was the son of Atri. Di1rghatamas or Vitatha was the adopted son of Bharata, son of Dus2yanta. (Bha1gavata and Kampara1ma1yan2a. For
<>details see under Bharata I and Di1rghatamas.</F> [Page117-a+ 65]
<HI>BHARADVA1JA II. The sage Bharadva1ja of Pura1n2ic
<>fame.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a of Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a states that this sage was the son of Atri
<>Mahars2i. He lived for many thousands of years. He is
<>connected with Va1lmi1ki and the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Bharadva1ja was for many years a disciple of Va1lmi1ki.
<>He was present with Va1lmi1ki when the hunter killed
<>one of the couple of Kraun5ca. When Va1lmi1ki and
<>Bharadva1ja reached the shores of the river, Tamasa1,
<>that day Va1lmi1ki told Bharadva1ja thus: “Look, Bhara-
<>dva1ja, what a clean ghat this is. The water is pure and
<>clear. Place your water-jug here and give me my
<>valkala. We will get down here in this sacred water”.
<>Then Va1lmi1ki taking the valkala from the disciple
<>walked along the shore admiring the beauty of the
<>forest trees and found on his way the historic Kraun5ca
<>couple. (Sarga 2, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Bharadva1ja and the study of Vedas.%} Bharadva1ja gave
<>himself untiringly to the study of the Vedas. He obtain-
<>ed from Indra a boon to extend his term of life on
<>earth to many thousands of years by different stages,
<>each stage covering a span of a thousand years of life.
<>All these years he devoted to an incessant study of the
<>Vedas. Finding the term not sufficient for completing
<>the study of the Vedas he appealed to Indra again for
<>extension and Indra appearing in person took him before
<>three mountains and giving him three handfuls of
<>sand told him thus, “What you have studied about
<>Vedas till this time is equivalent to the amount of
<>sand I have now given and what is yet to be studied
<>about the Vedas is as big as the three mountains before
<>you”. Any other mortal being would have been dis-
<>heartened by this revelation made by Indra, but not
<>Bharadva1ja. Undaunted he continued his studies. (Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>3) {%Bharadva1ja in the role of a magician.%} The a1s4rama of
<>Bharadva1ja was in Citraku1t2a and S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the beginning of their exile went to his
<>a1s4rama accepting his blessings. Bharata on his return
<>from Kekaya knew about the exile of his brothers and
<>hoping to bring them back to Ayodhya1 went in search
<>of them with a big retinue of soldiers and men. Keeping
<>the retinue outside, Bharata went to the a1s4rama of
<>Bharadva1ja. The latter decided to give Bharata and his
<>people a grand reception and calling Vis4vakarma1 to his
<>side asked him to arrange a royal banquet that night.
<>Devas, Gandharvas, Apsarases, As2t2adikpa1las and all
<>such people were invited for the night. Renowned dancers
<>from devaloka like Ghr2ta1ci1, Hema1, Vis4va1ci1 Mis4rakes4i1 and
<>Alambus2a1 appeared for entertainment. Even Vanara1ji1
<>took part in the dance. Dishes of food came to the
<>guests of their own accord. The night came to an end
<>wonderfully and at daybreak everything vanished and
<>all were amazed at the magic of the sage. (Sarga 91,
<>Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%Dron2a's origin.%} Dron2a was the son born to Bhara-
<>dva1ja of the celestial woman, Ghr2ta1ci1. (see under
<>Dron2a).
<NI>5) {%How Bharadva1ja died once but was born again.%} See under
<>Arva1vasu.

<>bha1rata battle and requested Dron2a to lay down his
<>missile. (S4loka 35, Chapter 196, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(11) Once Bhr2gu Mahars2i asked him some questions on
<>the creation of this universe and Bharadva1ja gave him
<>satisfactory answers. (Chapter 182, S4a1nti Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(12) This sage performed the sacrifice Putraka1mes2t2i,
<>and gave a son to Divoda1sa. (Chapter 30, Anus4a1sana

<HI>BHARADVA1JA III. The eldest son of the Agni, S4amyu.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 219, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA IV. A renowned sage. Bharata, a King
<>of the Pu1ru line of kings, had no sons and as he was
<>spending his days in sorrow Marutta gave Bharata this
<>Bharadva1ja as a son. Bharadva1ja who was by birth a
<>brahmin from then onwards became a Ks2atriya.
<>(Matsya Pura1n2a 49. 27-39 and Va1yu Pura1n2a 99. 152-
<>158).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA V. A mahars2i born of the line of An3gi-
<>ras. He was the father of Yavakri1ta and a friend of
<>Raibhya, son of Vis4va1mitra.
<NI>Once Raibhya created a Kritya and that Kritya killed
<>Bharadva1ja's son Yavakri1ta. Unable to bear the loss of his
<>son Bharadva1ja was preparing to give up his own life
<>by jumping into the fire when Arva1vasu brought to life
<>Yavakri1ta and gave him to the sage. Immensely pleas-
<>ed at the regain of his son Bharadva1ja ended his life
<>on earth and went to heaven. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>165-168)
<HI>BHARADVA1JA VI. A brahmars2i who lived in the Pu1rva-
<>manvantara. He was living on the shore of Gan3ga1
<>doing rigorous penance. One day desirous of conduct-
<>ing a special type of Yajn5a he went to bathe in the [Page118-a+ 64]
<>river along with other sages. There he saw the celes-
<>tial beauty, Ghr2ta1ci1, standing in all splendour after her
<>bath. Bharadva1ja had seminal emission and from that
<>was born a daughter, S4rutavati1, to him. (Chapter 47,
<>S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA VII. A great scholar well-versed in
<>all the S4a1stras. He is the author of ‘Dharmasu1tra’ and
<>‘S4rautasu1tra’. (The Vis4vavidya1laya of Bombay keeps
<>a hand written copy of his work S4rautasu1tra written in
<>Pa1n2d2u script).
<HI>BHA1RADVA1JA I. A Mahars2i. It was he who convinced

<>would be endowed with long life. (Vana Parva, Chapter
<>288, Verse 16).
<HI>BHA1RADVA1JA II. The collective name of a particular
<>sect of preceptors mentioned in the Upanis2ads. The
<>Br2hada1ran2yaka Upanis2ad refers to this sect of preceptors
<>as disciples of Bha1radva1ja, Pa1ra1s4arya, Vala1ka, Kaus4ika,
<>Aitareya, A1sura1yan2a and Baijava1pa1yana.
<HI>BHA1RADVA1JA III. A grammarian. According to the
<>R2ktantra, pra1tis4a1khya of Sa1maveda, it was Brahma1,
<>who first composed the science of grammar. This
<>science was taught by Brahma1 to others in the following
<>order: Brahma1 to Br2haspati, he to Indra, Indra to
<>Bha1radva1ja and he to his disciples.
<NI>Pa1n2ini has discussed the grammatical concepts of Bha1ra-
<>dva1ja. R2kpra1tis4a1khya and Taittiri1ya have quoted the
<>opinions of this grammarian.
<HI>BHARADVAJA(M). A place of habitation in ancient
<>Bha1rata. (S4loka 68, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Dus2yanta was once hunting in the forests when
<>he hit a fawn with his arrow. The fawn fled to the
<>A1s4rama of Kan2va Muni and the king followed it. On
<>reaching the A1s4rama grounds he saw S4akuntala1 water-
<>ing the plants helped by her companions Anasu1ya and
<>Priyam3vada1. Dus2yanta and S4akuntala1 fell in love with
<>each other at first sight. Kan2va was absent from the
<>A1s4rama and they married according to the Ga1ndharva
<>rites and S4akuntala1 became pregnant soon. The king
<>gave her his signet ring as a sign of faith and left for
<>his palace. When Dus2yanta left her S4akuntala1 fell into
<>a deep reverie and she never knew about the arrival of
<>the arrogant sage, Durva1sas to the a1s4rama. Durva1sas
<>mistook her as disrespectful and cursed her saying that
<>she would be forgotten by the man of whom she was
<>thinking then. S4akuntala1 never knew about the curse
<>also. [Page118-b+ 65]
<NI>Kan2va Muni when he returned to the A1s4rama and knew
<>everything, sent S4akuntala1 to the palace of Dus2yanta.
<>But King Dus2yanta never recognised her and when
<>S4akuntala1 was returning deeply grieved Menaka1 her
<>mother, took her and left her in the a1s4rama of Kas4yapa.
<>There S4akuntala1 delivered a son. The boy grew brave
<>and fearless and he could subdue even the wildest of
<>animals around there. Kas4yapa, therefore, named him
<>Sarvadamana.
<NI>Once when Dus2yanta was returning home after visiting
<>Indra he saw S4akuntala1, recognised her, and took her
<>and the boy to his palace. This was the boy who later
<>on became known as Bharata. (Chapter 73, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Marriage and reign.%} Bharata was a partial incarna-
<>tion of Maha1vis2n2u. Even while he was young he became
<>a ruler and conquering the world destroyed the wicked.
<>Bharata had three wives. All the sons born to them
<>were bad and so the mothers killed them all. Aggrieved
<>over the loss of his sons he worshipped the devas to
<>get a son for him. At that time the great preceptor
<>Br2haspati forcibly married Mamata1 the wife of his
<>brother. Mamata1 was pregnant then and when she
<>conceived from Br2haspati also she bore two children.
<>On delivery she threw the child of Br2haspati in the
<>forests and went away with the other son.
<NI>The Devas took care of the discarded child and named
<>him Bharadva1ja and gave the child to Bharata. Bharata
<>gave the boy the name Vitatha (Di1rghatamas). Bharata
<>ruled over his land for twentyseven thousand years and
<>the land was, therefore, called Bha1rata. (S4loka 96,
<>Chapter 2, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>After ruling the land ideally he left for the forests
<>entrusting the land to his son, Vitatha. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>Vitatha also was called Bharata and he had five sons:
<>Suhotra, Suhota, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu. (Chapter

<>Kausalya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1. Kausalya1 gave birth
<>to S4ri1 Ra1ma, Kaikeyi1 to Bharata and Sumitra1 to
<>Laks2man2a and S4atrughna. Kaikeyi1, mother of Bharata,
<>was the sister of Yudha1jit, Ra1ja1 of Kekeya. Bharata
<>was born on the day of Pu1ya. (S4loka 14, Sarga 18,

<>ya1ga (A sacrificial ceremony to get children) with
<>the Mahars2i R2s2yas4r2n3ga as the officiating priest. From

<>wives of Das4aratha became pregnant. (Sarga 15,

<NI>3) {%Till the end of S4ri1 Ra1ma's forest life.%} The sons of
<>Das4aratha married the daughters of Janaka, King of
<>Mithila1. S4ri1 Ra1ma married Si1ta1, Bharata, Ma1n2d2avi1,
<>Laks2man2a, U1rmila1 and S4atrughna, S4rutaki1rti1.
<NI>Das4aratha made arrangements to crown Ra1ma as King
<>and then leave for the forests and lead an ascetic life.
<>At that time Bharata and S4atrughna were in the
<>country of Kekaya with their uncle, Yudha1jit. When
<>the day of coronation was drawing near Kaikeyi1
<>demanded of Das4aratha the execution of two boons
<>which were once promised by Das4aratha to her long
<>ago during a battle between the devas and asuras. One
<>of them was to crown her son, Bharata, as king and the
<>other to send Ra1ma to the forests for a period of
<>fourteen years. Das4aratha was shocked to hear that.
<>But, without any hesitation, Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>accompanied by Si1ta1 went to the forests and Das4aratha
<>overcome with immense grief caused by this unplea-
<>sant turn of events fell down dead. Messengers were
<>sent then to Kekaya to bring Bharata and after travel-
<>ling for three days Bharata and S4atrughn2a reached
<>Ayodhya1. Though they were not informed of the death
<>of their father they were worried all the way because
<>of the several bad omens which they saw. On entering
<>Ayodhya1 they were shocked to find all the roads deso-
<>late and arriving at the palace they found it silent and
<>gloomy. Kaikeyi1 then told him all that had happened
<>and when Bharata knew that his mother was at the
<>root of all this calamity his rage knew no bounds.
<>Forgetting himself he drew from the sheath the glitter-
<>ing sword and stood before his mother with the drawn
<>sword wavering to strike or not to strike and mused to
<>himself “No, Not a woman and not one's own mother,
<>No, it should not be done”. Immediately after this was
<>decided, he swung the sword straight to his throat.
<>But adroitly S4atrughna intervened and swept away the
<>sword before it fell at its aim. This strong move of
<>S4atrughna brought Bharata to his senses and he looked
<>at his mother so fiendishly that at his stare his mother
<>turned pale like a flower brought near a burning flame.
<>Bharata immediately changed into the dress of a
<>Sannya1si1 and started to go to the forests. S4atrughna
<>followed his brother. Vasis2t2ha also started. The news
<>spread like wildfire and people began to crowd at the
<>palace eager to follow the brothers. Very soon a huge
<>procession was seen moving towards the forests. Vasis2t2ha
<>and Arundhati1 in a chariot in the front, Kausalya1 and
<>Sumitra1 in another next to it and Bharata and S4atru-
<>ghna closely following the chariots, walking. People
<>joined the procession from behind. The great crowd
<>of people reached the banks of the river Gan3ga1. Guha
<>coming to know of the great exile of people from
<>Ayodhya1 through spies went and saw Bharata, at first
<>in disguise, and later as himself made his acquaintance.
<>He then took Bharata and S4atrughna across the river
<>to the presence of S4ri Ra1ma at Citraku1t2a.
<NI>When they reached Citraku1t2a only Bharata-S4atrughna,
<>Vasis2t2ha and Arundhati1, Kausalya1 and Sumitra1 entered
<>the a1s4rama of S4ri1 Ra1ma, all the others remaining out-
<>side. When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were told about the
<>death of their father they were filled with grief. All the
<>sons, then, Vasis2t2ha officiating, performed the obsequies
<>of their father. Ra1ma and Bharata then discussed the
<>future. S4ri1 Ra1ma persisted in his vow and said he
<>would return to his country only after fourteen years [Page119-b+ 65]
<>and insisted that Bharata should rule the country
<>during that period. Bharata accepted the arrangement
<>saying that if his brother did not come back after four-
<>teen years he would give up his life by jumping into
<>the fire. S4ri1 Ra1ma then gave his sandals to Bharata who
<>accepting the same with due respect returned home
<>followed by others. On reaching Ayodhya1 Bharata did
<>not go to the royal palace which he considered as empty
<>because of the absence of his brother, Ra1ma and
<>abhorrent because of the presence of his mother, Kaikeyi1.
<>Instead, he went to a nearby village called Nandi and
<>installing the sandals there lived there and ruled the
<>country.
<NI>4) {%Return of S4ri1 Ra1ma.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma when he came back
<>to Ayodhya1 after fourteen years was crowned King.
<>Bharata got two sons of his wife Ma1n2d2avi1, Suba1hu and
<>S4u1rasena. While they were thus living happily in
<>Ayodhya1, message was sent through an ascetic by
<>Yudha1jit from Kekaya that some gandharvas were
<>creating trouble in that country. It was the state of
<>Sindhu in Kekaya which was subjected to this
<>molestation and on the advice of Ra1ma Bharata went
<>and subdued the trouble, killing the gandharvas. He
<>then created two small states on either side of Sindhu
<>and made his two sons the Kings of those states.
<>When S4ri1 Ra1ma gave up his life in Sarayu1 river and
<>rose to heaven as Vis2n2u Bharata and S4atrughna also
<>gave up their lives and took the forms of the conch
<>and the wheel which adorn the hands of Vis2n2u.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>BHARATA III. A son of R2s2abha.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u-
<>Brahma1-Sva1yambhuvamanu-Priyavrata-Agni1dhra-
<>Na1bhi-R2s2abha-Bharata.
<NI>Emperor Priyavrata partitioned his empire to his eight
<>children. Agni1dhra got Jambudvi1pa. Agni1dhra had
<>nine sons: Na1bhi, Kimpurus2a, Harivars2a, Ila1vr2ta,
<>Ramya, Hiran2van, Kuru Bhadra1s4va and Ketuma1la. On
<>the death of the father Jambudvi1pa was divided into
<>nine states and Na1bhi got the land called Hima. Na1bhi
<>married Merudevi1 and got a son, R2s2abha. R2s2abha had
<>a hundred sons and Bharata was the eldest. (Chapter 1,
<>Am3s4am 2, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%Marriage, administration and entry into A1s4rama life.%}
<>Bharata took over the administration of the kingdom
<>at the death of his father, R2s2abha. He married Pan5ca-
<>jani1 daughter of Vis4varu1pa. They had five sons, Sumati,
<>Ra1s2trabhr2t, Sudars4ana, A1varan2a and Dhu1mraketu. The
<>Pan5cama Skandha of Bha1gavata contains a statement
<>to the effect that India got the name Bha1rata from
<>this king. (It is worthwhile remembering at this
<>juncture a previous statement that the name Bha1rata
<>was obtained from Bharata, son of Dus2yanta). Bharata
<>like his forefather was very erudite and affectionate
<>and always respected his duties. He always meditated
<>on Brahma1 and in his heart there shone the Parama-
<>purus2a in the figure of Va1sudeva adorned with Sri1vatsa,
<>Kaustubha, Vanama1la1, S4am3kha, Cakra, Gada1 and
<>Padma. He ruled the country for a crore of years and
<>after that dividing the country among his sons went to
<>the a1s4rama of Pulaha Mahars2i to spend the rest of his
<>life there. On the rocks lying in the river flowing in
<>front of the A1s4rama were the marks of Cakra on one
<>side and Na1bhi on the other and the river therefore
<>came to be known as Cakrana1bhi. Bathing in this river [Page120-a+ 59]
<>and doing pu1ja1 Bharata lived there oblivious of the
<>world outside. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Bharata and the deer.%} Bharata led a purely ascetic
<>life performing everyday the rites laid down by
<>scriptures and muttering the mystic formula of Brahma1-
<>ks2ara. One day a thirsty pregnant deer went to drink
<>water in a nearby pond. As it was drinking it heard
<>the loud roar of a lion nearby. Frightened the poor
<>animal without even waiting to quench its thirst ran
<>into the forest and on its way delivered a child and the
<>deer-babe fell into the river. The deer exhausted and
<>tormented by fear ran into a cave and fell down dead.
<>Bharata happened to see the new-born deer floating
<>on the river and took it to his a1s4rama. From then on-
<>wards Bharata's mind was diverted from the spiritual
<>to the mundane effort of taking care of the young deer.
<>The deer followed him wherever he went and if it did
<>not turn up in time in the evening after grazing
<>Bharata went about in search of it weeping. Years went
<>by and Bharata became old and died with the name of
<>the deer on his lips. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Rebirths of Bharata.%} Because he died with the
<>thought of the deer in his mind he was reborn as a
<>deer. The deer was aware of his previous birth and
<>regretted that he spent the life of a man for the sake
<>of a deer. The deer, therefore, left the house of his
<>mother in the mountain of Ka1lan5jara and went to the
<>a1s4rama of Pulaha. The pious animal daily bathed in
<>the river and died there on the bank of that river. So
<>in its next life the deer was born as the son of a
<>brahmin in the line of An3giras. That brahmin had two
<>wives and got nine sons of his first wife and one of the
<>second. The son born to the second wife was none other
<>than Bharata. In due course the brahmin died and his
<>second wife jumped into the funeral pyre and ended her
<>life. Thrown an orphan Bharata became a puppet in
<>the hands of his brothers. Bharata was asked to look
<>after the cattle and fields of his brothers for his living.
<>With great forbearance Bharata did all he was told.
<NI>One day Bharata was keeping watch over the fields of
<>his brothers. It was midnight. In the neighbourhood
<>the Can2d2a1las were making merry over the birth of a
<>child to one of the women. Some of them were bringing a
<>man bound by ropes to be given as ‘Narabali’ to the
<>goddess Ka1li1. (Narabali is the offering of a human
<>being with his head cut off to propitiate a deity). On
<>the way the man escaped and the disappointed
<>Can2d2a1las were roaming about in search of a substitute
<>when they came across Bharata keeping watch over
<>the fields. Immediately he was bound by ropes and
<>taken before the idol of Ka1li1. The effulgence of the
<>brahmin astounded Ka1li1 and getting angry for bringing
<>such a pious brahmin for sacrifice she devoured the
<>Can2d2a1las and allowed the brahmin to go free.
<NI>Escaping from there Bharata reached a village walking
<>all the way. That village was being ruled over by a
<>king called Rahu1gan2a and that king was going to see
<>Bhagava1n Kapila Mahars2i along the banks of the river
<>Iks2umati1 in a palanquin. The palanquin had not enough [Page120-b+ 63]
<>bearers and so the brahmin was asked to join the
<>team of bearers. As they were moving the palanquin
<>shook because of the wrong steps kept by Bharata. The
<>king reprimanded Bharata and Bharata then gave the
<>king fitting replies based on the ethics of Veda1nta. The
<>erudition of Bharata greatly impressed the king and he
<>stepped down from the palanquin and bowed to
<>Bharata.
<NI>Bharata went from there to the forests singing devo-
<>tional songs in praise of Vis2n2u and at last attained
<>salvation. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>BHARATA IV. A sage and the famous author of Na1t2ya-
<>s4a1stra. He was a critic who lived around the year 400
<>B.C. His book on Na1t2yas4a1stra (Histrionics) is world
<>famous. Ka1lida1sa in the second act of his drama,
<>Vikramorvas4i1ya states that this Bharata used to coach
<>the devas in the art of acting. Na1t2yas4a1stra is a book
<>comprising thirtyseven chapters dealing with the art of
<>dance and music. He has written in detail about the
<>four Alam3ka1ras, Upama1, Di1paka, Ru1paka and Yamaka
<>and also about the ten requisites of a Ka1vya. He has
<>not forgotten to write about the defects and demerits
<>of Ka1vya also. Commentaries on Na1t2yas4a1stra have
<>been written by lions in the profession: Mitragupta,
<>Hars2avardhana, S4an3kuka, Udbhat2a, Bhat2t2ana1yaka and
<>Abhinavagupta. Of these ‘Abhinavabha1rati1’ the com-
<>mentary written by Abhinavagupta is the only one
<>freely available now.
<HI>BHARATA V. The Maha1bha1rata speaks about a few
<>other Bharatas who were sons of Agni. S4amyu is a son
<>of Agni known as Bharata. This Bharata has got
<>another name, U1rjja. (S4loka 6, Chapter 219, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.). There is an Agni of name Bharata with
<>a son named Bha1rata. When this Agni is propitiated
<>one gets healthy and strong and so this Agni is called
<>Pus2t2ima1n also. (S4loka 7, Chapter 219, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.). There is another Bharata son of an Agni
<>called Adbhuta. It is this Agni that burns dead bodies.
<>As this Agni lives permanently in Agnis2t2oma Yajn5as; it
<>gets the name of Niyata also. (S4loka 6, Chapter 222,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHA1RATA (MAHA1BHA1RATA). An epic written by
<>Vya1sa.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The Maha1bha1rata is an epic.
<>Bharata is acclaimed as the first emperor of Bha1rata.
<>The theme of this great epic is the fight between the
<>two lines of princes belonging to the dynasty of Bharata.
<>That is why the book is called Maha1bha1rata.
<>The great size of the volume and the greatness of
<>the wisdom contained therein have contributed much
<>to its getting the name, Maha1bha1rata. Once the
<>devas put the Maha1bha1rata in one pan of a balance
<>and the Vedas in the other pan. Then the devas
<>were convinced that the Maha1bha1rata weighed more
<>than all the Vedas put together. (S4lokas 269-271,
<>Chapter 1, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>Maha1bha1rata is not a mere epic. It is a whole literature
<>in itself containing a philosophy which has been an
<>unfailing and perennial source of spiritual strength to
<>the people of India. Above all it has for its core the
<>Gi1ta1 which is perhaps the noblest of scriptures.
<NI>The Maha1bha1rata comprises eighteen books, each book
<>being called a Parva. There are 2109 chapters in it, the
<>chapters differing in size. Besides, there is an annexe
<>called Harivam3s4a which deals with the life and history
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>2) {%Contents.%} The contents of each Parva are succinctly
<>given below: The Parvas are so named as to give a
<>hint of their central theme.
<NI>(1) {%A1di Parva.%} (A1di = beginning). Pa1n2d2u and Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra, king of the Candra dynasty, are brothers. Bhi1s2ma
<>brought them up. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born blind and he
<>got a hundred children of his wife Ga1ndha1ri1. They
<>were called the Kauravas. Pa1n2d2u had two wives Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1 and got of them five sons called the
<>Pa1n2d2avas headed by the eldest Yudhis2t2hira.
<NI>(2) {%Sabha1 Parva%} (Sabha1 = court). The Pa1n2d2avas and
<>Kauravas lived together in the court at Hastina1pura.
<>There, the Kauravas entered into a game of dice with
<>Yudhis2t2hira and through the deceitful tactics engineer-
<>ed by the keen-witted S4akuni, Yudhis2t2hira was defeated
<>and he lost everything he possessed. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>were then compelled to go into exile to the forests for
<>twelve years and spend another year after that incog-
<>nito. If they were found out during that period of
<>incognito they were to go into exile for another term
<>of twelve years. The Pa1n2d2avas accompanied by Pa1n5ca1li1
<>left for the forests.
<NI>(3) {%Vana Parva%} (Vana = forest). This is one of the
<>longest of Parvas and describes the life of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>in the forest Ka1myaka. The well known stories ‘Nala
<>Carita’ and ‘Kira1ta1rjuni1ya’ are told in this Parva’.
<NI>(4) {%Vira1t2a Purva.%} (Vira1t2a = name of a King). The Pa1n2d2av-
<>as after completing their term of exile in the forests spent
<>the year of their life in incognito at the court of King
<>Vira1t2a. Many wonderful events took place during their
<>stay there and this Parva deals in detail about
<>them.
<NI>(5) {%Bhi1s2ma Parva%} (Bhi1s2ma = The first Generalissimo of
<>the Kauravas). The great Maha1bha1rata war was fought
<>in the vast expanse of Kuruks2etra lying to the north-
<>west of Delhi. Bhi1s2ma was the first generalissimo of the
<>Kauravas and Dhr2s2t2adyumna of the Pa1n2d2avas. Vya1sa
<>describes the events of the battle classifying it accord-
<>ing to the generalissimos of the Kaurava army giving
<>the four generalissimos a Parva each. Bhi1s2ma fought
<>for ten days and was struck down on the tenth day by
<>an arrow from Arjuna.
<NI>(6) {%Dron2a Parva%} (Dron2a = The second Generalissimo).
<>When Bhi1s2ma fell Dron2a took charge as the supreme
<>commander. This Parva deals with the fight under his
<>command. Dron2a was killed in the end by Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna. [Page121-b+ 65]
<NI>(7) {%Karn2a Parva.%} (Karn2a = The third generalissimo).
<>This Parva deals with the war under the command of
<>Karn2a. Karn2a fell in the end at the hands of Arjuna.
<NI>(8) {%S4alya Parva.%} (S4alya = The fourth and last of the
<>Generalissimos). When Karn2a fell S4alya took over
<>charge of the Kaurava army. As the war was coming to
<>an end most of the big warriors of the Kaurava army
<>were killed. In the end Bhi1ma and Duryodhana met
<>in a grim fight with maces in which Duryodhana was
<>killed. This Parva deals with the final stage of the
<>battle.
<NI>(10) {%Sauptika Parva.%} (Sauptika = pertaining to sleep).
<>This Parva tells us the tragic story of how Kr2pa1ca1rya,
<>Kr2tavarma1 and As4vattha1ma1 who were the only three
<>left with Duryodhana after the great battle went into
<>the camp of the Pa1n2d2avas at night and killed all the
<>brave warriors of the Pa1n2d2ava army, excepting the
<>Pa1n2d2avas, who were sleeping in their camp unaware of
<>the foul play lying ahead.
<NI>(11) {%Stri1 Parva.%} (Stri1 = woman). This Parva deals with
<>the great lamentation in the battlefield, after the war,
<>of Ga1ndha1ri1 and other women.
<NI>(12) {%S4a1nti Parva.%} Yudhis2t2hira was crowned king and
<>even at that time Bhi1s2ma was lying on his bed of arrows
<>awaiting death. Before taking up his duties of the state
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to where the grandsire lay dying and
<>took his blessing and instruction in dharma. This
<>instruction of Bhi1s2ma1ca1rya to King Yudhis2t2hira of the
<>three dharmas, Ra1jadharma, A1paddharma and Moks2a-
<>dharma is the famous S4anti Parva.
<NI>(13) {%Anus4a1sana Parva.%} (Anus4a1sana = Instruction).
<>Bhi1s2ma still on his death-bed continues his instructions
<>on several topics, like duty, freedom and fasting, giving
<>entertaining stories to illustrate the essence of his teach-
<>ing. This Parva is devoted to this.
<NI>(14) {%A1s4vamedhika Parva.%} (As4vamedha = ya1ga conduct-
<>ed by emperors). This Parva deals with the ya1ga
<>conducted by Yudhis2t2hira when he became the empe-
<>ror of Bha1rata.
<NI>(15) {%A1s4ramava1sika Parva.%} (A1s4ramava1sa = life in a her-
<>mitage). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, the blind and his wife Ga1ndha1ri1
<>accompanied by Kunti1 left for the forests and lived
<>there for two years in a hermitage. One day the forest
<>caught fire and the three without trying to escape sat
<>on the ground facing eastwards in yoga posture and
<>calmly gave up themselves to the flames. This is dealt
<>with in this Parva.
<NI>(16) {%Mausala Parva.%} (Mausala = Mace). This Parva
<>gives the story of how the Ya1davas fought against each
<>other with maces and were destroyed and how
<>Dva1raka1 sank down into the ocean. It describes the
<>death of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma also.
<NI>(17) {%Maha1prastha1nika Parva.%} (Maha1prastha1na = Death).
<>Dharmaputra entrusts his kingdom to his successor and
<>alongwith his four brothers and wife Pa1n5ca1li1 sets out
<>on a long journey to Maha1meru never to return. This
<>journey to death is detailed in this Parva.
<NI>(18) {%Svarga1rohan2a Parva.%} (Svarga = Heaven). This Parva
<>describes the entry of the Pa1n2d2avas and their relatives
<>into Svarga, heaven.
<NI>3) {%Mode of Narration.%} Most of the verses in the
<>Maha1bha1rata are in the Anus2t2up metre. At certain
<>places other metres also have been used. There are
<>prose pieces also in it. There are twenty notable pieces,
<>three in A1di Parva, seven in Vana Parva, seven in S4a1nti [Page122-a+ 51]
<>Parva and three in Anus4a1sana Parva. All the pieces are
<>statements by realised souls. The style of the poetry is
<>simple and the method of presentation lively. At times
<>the imagination of the poet extends up to the horizon.
<>Though there is a flow of spiritualism throughout the
<>matter is purely mundane.
<NI>4) {%Authorship.%} Bhagava1n Vya1sa is believed to be the
<>author of Maha1bha1rata. He was a contemporary of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas. Many of the events of the
<>Maha1bha1rata were personally witnessed by Vya1sa. He
<>took three years to write this book. The following
<>s4lokas will support the above:
<Poem>Kurura1ja kulastha1na1m3
<>Dr2s2t2am3 vr2ttam3 ca yatsthitam /
<>Tatsarvam3 bhagava1n Vya1so
<>Varn2aya1ma1sa Bha1rate. //

<>Kr2s2n2advaipa1yano munih2 /
<>Maha1bha1ratama1khya1nam3
<>Kr2tava1nidamuttamam. //</Poem>
<>(S4loka 55, Chapter 62, A1di Parva).
<>The Vara1ha Pura1n2a states that Vya1sa composed the
<>Maha1bha1rata at a period when the end of Dva1para
<>yuga merged with the dawn of the Kaliyuga. The
<>Bha1gavata states that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a passed away on the
<>first day of Kaliyuga. The Bha1gavata is devoted to
<>admire and praise the life of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. This book also
<>is written by Vya1sa. This s4loka found in the first Chap-
<>ter of A1di Parva clears the doubt:
<Poem>Va1sudevasya ma1ha1tmyam3
<>Pa1n2d2ava1na1m3 ca satyata1m /
<>Durvr2ttam3 Dha1rttara1s2t2ra1n2a1m3
<>Uktava1n Bhagava1nr2s2ih2. //</Poem>
<>The original name of the Bha1rata which Vya1sa compos-
<>ed was ‘Jaya’. In the first Chapter of A1di Parva is this
<>s4loka to support this statement:
<Poem>Na1ra1yan2am3 namaskr2tya
<>Naram3 caiva narottamam3/
<>Devi1m3 Sarasvati1m3 caiva
<>Tato Jayamudi1rayet//</Poem>
<>After the death of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas the
<>disciples of Vya1sa, Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, S4uka and
<>Vais4ampa1yana gave this book great publicity. They
<>wrote books based on this story of Bha1rata of which
<>only the ‘Bha1rata’ of Vais4ampa1yana and the As4va-
<>medha Parva of Jaimini are now available.
<NI>Vya1sa's Bha1rata was first expounded by Vais4ampa1yana
<>at the Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya. At the request of
<>Janamejaya, Vais4ampa1yana added some more facts to
<>the original work known then as ‘Jaya’. Jaya with the [Page122-b+ 69]
<>accretions came to be known as Bha1ratasam3hita1. Su1ta
<>who narrated this story to S4aunaka and others at the
<>forest of Naimis4a added some more matter to the
<>Bha1ratasam3hita1 and made it larger. The present
<>Maha1bha1rata is this expanded edition.
<NI>The following facts prove that the Maha1bha1rata has
<>thus passed through three stages of evolution:
<NI>1) This book is known by three names: Jaya, Bha1rata-
<>sam3hita1 and Maha1bha1rata.
<F>1) <Poem>(a) Jayo na1metiha1so'yam3
<>S4rotavyo vijigi1s2un2a1 (S4loka 22, Chapter 62, A1di Parva).

<>(c) Refer to the s4loka given in para 1.</Poem></F>
<NI>2) There is a reference to the three parts of the book
<>in S4loka 66, Chapter 1 of A1di Parva.
<F>2) <Poem>Manva1di Bha1ratam3 kecid
<>A1stika1di tatha1pare
<>Tathopari cara1danye
<>Vipra1h2 samyagadhi1yire.</Poem></F>
<NI>3) There are three different opinions regarding the
<>total number of s4lokas in the Maha1bha1rata. According
<>to Ugras4ravas there are 8800 verses, according to Vya1sa
<>24000 verses and according to another statement a
<>lakh of verses.
<F>3) <Poem>Idam3 s4atasahasram3 tu loka1na1m pun2yakarman2a1m

<>Aham3 vedmi s4uko vetti San5jayo vetti va1 na va1.</Poem>
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<NI>4) The narration appears to be of three different kinds,
<>descriptive, philosophical and oratorical, indicative of
<>three different authorships.
<NI>5) Su1ta and Vais4ampa1yana have made accretions to
<>the original work ‘Jaya’ of Vya1sa.
<NI>Viewed with these facts we are led to believe that
<>Vya1sa has composed only the very essence of Maha1-
<>bha1rata comprising 8800 s4lokas and that work was
<>known as ‘Jaya’ as referred to in the first invocatory
<>verse of the epic. Vais4ampa1yana added a few verses of
<>his own and brought the number to 24,000 and gave the
<>book the name of ‘Bha1ratasam3hita1’. It was Su1ta who
<>made many more additions and made the book so big
<>as to fetch it the name of ‘Maha1bha1rata’. The epic
<>which is now current among us contains a lakh of
<>verses and it took perhaps centuries to get this transfor-
<>mation of the book from ‘Jaya’ to ‘Maha1bha1rata’.
<NI>6) {%Period of publication.%} The Kali Vars2a starts from
<>3102 B.C. The great Maha1bha1rata war was fought at
<>a period when the end of Dva1para yuga merged into
<>the dawn of Kali yuga as could be gathered from the
<>following verse from the epic:
<Poem>Antare caiva sampra1pte
<>Kalidva1parayorabhu1t /
<>Samantapan5cake yuddham3
<>Kurupa1n2d2avasenayoh2. //</Poem>
<>(S4loka 13, Chapter 2, A1di Parva).
<>So it can be deduced that the great war was fought
<>round about 3102 B.C. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra lived for eighteen
<>years after the great battle and the Pa1n2d2avas ruled the
<>country for 36 years. (Stri1 Parva, M.B.). It was when
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a died that the Pa1n2d2avas ended their rule
<>and commenced the Maha1prastha1na. So it can be sur-
<>mised that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a lived for 36 years after the war. [Page123-a+ 62]
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a died on the first day of Kali yuga, 3102 B.C.
<>Therefore it is clear the Maha1bha1rata battle was fought
<>in 3138 B.C. There are indications in other pura1n2as
<>to support this theory. There was that rare phenomenon
<>of a Saptagraha yoga (Combination in astronomical
<>position of seven planets) while King Pari1ks2it, son of
<>Arjuna, was ruling the country.
<F>1. (a) Saptars2ayo magha1yukta1h2 ka1le pa1riks2ite s4atam (Matsya pura1n2a 271. 46).
<>(b) Te tu pa1ri1ks2ite ka1le magha1sva1san dvijottama (Visnu pura1na 4, 24, 106).</F> This happened in a
<>month of Ma1gha (January) and a probe into the dates
<>of such previous occurrences revealed that a similar
<>one had happened in the month of Ma1gha in the years
<>3177 and 477 B.C. (The next one is to happen in 2223
<>A.D.). This phenomenon repeats itself in every hundred
<>years and so it is to be believed that one of the kind
<>happened in 3077 B.C. precisely during the period of
<>Pari1ks2it. It is therefore confirmatory to the statement
<>that the great war occurred in 3138 B.C.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas ruled the country for 36 years after the
<>war and Vya1sa wrote this divine epic after the death
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. Vya1sa took three years to complete
<>his work. Therefore it can be well concluded that
<>Vya1sa wrote the epic in 3100 B.C. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>commenced their Maha1prastha1na after entrusting the
<>administration of the state into the hands of Pari1ks2it.
<>This must have happened in 3102 B.C. Pari1ks2it ruled
<>the country for 60 years and so his son Janamejaya
<>became King in 3042 B.C. It was after two years of
<>his becom3ing King that he conducted the Sarpasatra
<>and it was at this Sarpasatra that Vais4ampa1yana first
<>expounded ‘Jaya’ (Maha1bha1rata) to the sages assembl-
<>ed there.
<NI>This fixing of the date of Maha1bha1rata is based on the
<>conclusions arrived at by the pandits of Bha1rata, but
<>foreign chronologists differ from us. They argue that
<>it was in the 10th century B.C. that the Maha1bha1rata
<>battle took place on the strength of the following:
<NI>The theme of the Maha1bha1rata is a fight between
<>Kurus and Pa1n5ca1las. After the war the two join and
<>there is a statement in the Yajurveda of a people
<>formed by the merger of the two. Therefore the great
<>war should have happened in the 10th century B.C. It
<>was a period of hero-worship and songs on the heroic
<>deeds of the Kurus and Pa1n2d2avas were sung and
<>handed over from one generation to the other and
<>gradually those songs took shape in the form of the
<>Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>There is another school of thought. In the Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Brahma1 is given great prominence. But in
<>Vedic times Brahma1 was not counted at all. During
<>the golden period of the Buddhists Brahma1 had a cons-
<>picuous hold on Hinduism. Therefore it should be
<>deduced that the Maha1bha1rata was written during the
<>6th century B.C. Then there were about 8,000 verses
<>in the Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>Towards the second stage of Maha1bha1rata the epic
<>grew in size bringing into its fold about 24,000 s4lokas.
<>It was at this stage that the Maha1bha1rata got a vais2n2a-
<>vite colour and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was adored as an incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u. Megasthenes who visited India in 300 B.C.
<>records that the majority of Hindus were vais2n2avites
<>at that period. There are references in certain parts [Page123-b+ 61]
<>of the Maha1bha1rata to Greeks and Buddhists. There-
<>fore a set of foreign chronologists conclude that those
<>portions of the Maha1bha1rata could have been written
<>only after Buddha and after the attack on Bha1rata by
<>the Greeks i.e. by 300 B.C.
<NI>The third stage of the Maha1bha1rata is its present form
<>and it was at this stage that it included new philosophy
<>in it. The Dharmasam3hita1 of Manusmr2ti became popular
<>in the fifth century A.D. and therefore the third stage
<>of the Maha1bha1rata must have started before that, in
<>the 3rd century A.D.
<HI>BHA1RATA II. (Bha1ratavars2a. India).
<NI>The pura1n2as describe the Earth to be constituted of
<>seven continents: Jambu1dvi1pa, Plaks2advi1pa, S4a1lmali1-
<>dvi1pa, Kus4advi1pa, Kraun5cadvi1pa, S4a1kadvi1pa and
<>Pus2karadvi1pa. Of these India is Jambu1dvi1pa.
<NI>The Bha1ratavars2a was constituted of nine islands at
<>that time in the following positions: In the centre
<>was Ila1vr2ta and to the east was Bhadravars2a. To the
<>south-east was Hiran2yaka and to the south was Bha1rata.
<>To the southwest was Hari and to the west was Ketu-
<>ma1la. To the north-west was cambaka and to the north
<>was Kuruvars2a. Beautiful Kim3purus2a vars2a stood to the
<>north-east of Ila1vr2ta. There was neither the passage of
<>time nor the fear of ageing or death in any of these
<>continents excepting Bha1ratavars2a.
<NI>This Bha1ratavars2a itself is a group of nine islands
<>each separated from the other by oceans and thus made
<>not easily accessible between each other. Indradvi1pa,
<>Kas4eruma1n, Ta1mraparn2a, Gabhastima1n, Na1gadvi1pa,
<>Kat2a1ha, Sim3hala and Va1run2a are the eight others and the
<>ninth is this island of Bha1ratavars2a. This island is called
<>Kuma1ra also. On the eastern boundary of this island live
<>Kira1tas, on the western side, Yavanas, on the southern
<>boundary A1ndhras and on the north Turus2kas. In the
<>Centre live the Bra1hmins, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas and S4u1dras.
<>The eight sacred mountains of this place are Mahendra,
<>Malaya, Sahya, S4uktima1n, R2ks2aparvata, Vindhya and

<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He was the son of Vidya1sa1gara, a great brahmin
<>scholar, who lived in Pa1t2ali1putra. There is a legend
<>about the birth of Bhartr2hari in Uttara Bha1rata.
<NI>Vidya1sa1gara while young learnt the Vedas from his
<>guru. But he was not satisfied with that study and
<>wanted to learn more about all s4a1stras and so he started
<>on a tour to find out a guru who would teach him all
<>he wanted. On his way he met several great scholars
<>but none came up to his standard of a guru. One day
<>tired after a long journey he reached a mountain valley.
<>Washing his hands and feet in a nearby river and
<>quenching his thirst he went and sat down under a
<>banyan tree to rest. The cool breeze sent the tired
<>brahmin to sleep and he slept.
<NI>A Brahmara1ks2asa who was living on the top of the ban-
<>yan tree when it became midday descended from
<>the tree to perform the sacred rites of the day and found
<>a man lying asleep. By the sacred thread on his body
<>the Brahmara1ks2asa surmised that the man was a brah-
<>min and woke him up. Waking up Vidya1sa1gara found
<>to his surprise the bearded Brahmara1ks2asa standing be-
<>fore him and after mutual enquiries Vidya1sa1gara told
<>him of his mission. The Brahmara1ks2asa told him thus:
<>“Boy, let your name Vidya1sa1gara (ocean of learning)
<>be true in your life. I am acquainted with many s4a1st-
<>ras and I shall teach you everything I know. But there
<>are certain conditions for the same which you have to
<>observe. You must live with me for six months and
<>should fast during that period behaving yourself as
<>one under a vow. I shall, however, teach you a mantra
<>which would help you to remain unaffected by hunger,
<>thirst or sleep. If you are prepared to accept these terms
<>and become my disciple I shall quench your thirst for
<>knowledge. Vidya1sa1gara willingly agreed to his terms
<>and became his student.
<NI>Both of them then climbed on the banyan tree and the
<>Brahmara1ks2asa sat in his usual place on a branch on
<>the tree and Vidya1sa1gara on a branch just below it. The
<>instructions started and continued for six months.
<>Vidya1sa1gara never felt thirst or hunger during that
<>period. When the teaching was complete the Brahma- [Page125-a+ 64]
<>ra1ks2asa bade farewell to his disciple and departed leaving
<>his body behind.
<NI>Vidya1sa1gara then got down from the tree and performed
<>the obsequies of his guru. Vidya1sa1gara while he was
<>learning used to note down the instructions of the guru
<>on the leaves of the banyan tree. It had come to a huge
<>bundle on completion. Taking the bundle along with
<>him Vidya1sa1gara left for his country. By the time he
<>left the forest area the power of the mantra faded and
<>Vidya1sa1gara began to feel the pangs of hunger and
<>thirst. By dusk he reached Kalin3ga and there he came
<>to the door of a dancing girl named Manda1kini1. The
<>door was locked as the owner was away in a S4iva temple
<>nearby. Exhausted by the journey, hungry and thirsty,
<>Vidya1sa1gara lay down on the doorstep and soon fell
<>asleep with the leaf-bundle as a pillow. Manda1kini1 when
<>she returned from the temple at about ten at night saw
<>a brahmin sleeping on the doorstep, tired and exhaust-
<>ed. She soon asked her servants to get him inside and
<>sent for a doctor. By the clever treatment of the doctor
<>and the expert nursing of Manda1kini1, Vidya1sa1gara sur-
<>vived. When he was fit for travel he started to go but
<>Manda1kini1 objected and requested him to marry her.
<>Vidya1sa1gara did not agree to it and she took him to the
<>King and told him all that had happened. Finding
<>Vidya1sa1gara to be one with great erudition and good
<>manners he decided that Vidya1sa1gara should marry
<>his daughter (a Ks2atriya), daughter of his minister
<>(a brahmin), daughter of Kulapati (a vais4ya), and
<>also Manda1kini1 (a S4u1dra). There was an injunction in
<>those days that a brahmin should marry a S4u1dra only
<>after having married from all the higher castes. The
<>decision of the King surmounted this difficulty for
<>Vidya1sa1gara to marry the s4u1dra girl, Manda1kini1.
<>Marriages were all conducted in order. The King's
<>daughter bore the name Kala1vati1, the minister's Ma1lati1
<>and Kulapati's Suman3gali1. Each delivered a son. The
<>brahmin boy was named Vararuci, the Ks2atriya boy,
<>Vikrama1ditya, the Vais4ya boy, Bhat2t2i and the S4u1dra
<>boy, Bhartr2hari.
<NI>2) {%Kingship.%} When the King of Kalin3ga became old
<>he gave the kingdom to Vidya1sa1gara and when Vidya1-
<>sa1gara died all his other sons made Bhartr2hari the King.
<>Bhartr2hari gave his father on his death-bed a promise
<>that he would see that no sons were born to him.
<F>1) There is a belief that if a son is born to a S4u1dra who was himself born of a brahmin the brahmin father would go to hell.</F>
<>So though Bhartr2hari married three wives he was care-
<>ful enough not to produce any children by them.
<NI>3) {%Bhartr2hari becomes a sannya1si1.%} Bhartr2hari was living
<>happily with his wife when one day a yogi1 of divine
<>disposition came to his house and giving him a ripe
<>mango said: “If you eat this mango you will never
<>become old. It is because you who are perfect in edu-
<>cation and fortune should live long for the benefit of
<>the people that I am giving you this.” So saying he
<>gave the mango and left the place. When the sannya1si1
<>left him Bhartr2hari thought thus: “After some years
<>my wife would become old and die. What is the use
<>of my remaining alive after she is gone. So this mango
<>should be given to her. Let her live long.” He,
<>therefore, gave the mango to his wife explaining
<>to her the greatness of the fruit. That wife whom poor
<>Bhartr2hari accepted to be very loving and chaste
<>had a lover. He was none other than the horse- [Page125-b+ 64]
<>groom of her husband and that prostitute thought
<>thus: “Of what use is my life when my lover is dead.
<>Let him live for ever”. So thinking she sent for her
<>lover and giving him the mango explained to him the
<>greatness of the thing. But the horse-groom was well
<>devoted to his wife and desiring that his wife should
<>remain young always he gave it to her. The groom's
<>wife was a servant-maid of the palace and it was at the
<>time of her departure from the palace after her day's
<>work that she was given the mango by the horse-groom
<>and so she carried it home in her hand. Bhartr2hari
<>who was returning from somewhere to the palace saw
<>the woman carrying the mango and questioned her and
<>knew how she got it. On coming to the palace he sent
<>for the horse-groom and though at first the horse-groom
<>tried to shield the queen, he was compelled to tell the
<>truth in the end. The truth pained him much “Phew!
<>It was this wretched and unfaithful woman whom I was
<>believing to be very chaste and loving. Woman can never
<>be believed. Look, she has fallen in love with an ugly-
<>looking servant of mine and unless he was her lover she
<>would not have given this mango to him. It is better
<>that this matter is not pursued any further now. We
<>will decide about the future course of action later”.
<>Thinking thus, he sent away the horse-groom and went
<>to his bed-chamber and lay there immersed in thoughts.
<>The horse-groom immediately informed the queen of
<>everything that took place and the queen felt sorry that
<>her secret had come to light. She knew that besides the
<>punishment that her lover would get her name would
<>also be blackened and so decided to kill her husband
<>before the affair became public. At once she made an
<>ot2t2at2a (flat bread made of wheat or rice) with poison in
<>it and bringing it to the bed-room told her husband thus
<>with much pretended affection. “It will take some time
<>for your lunch to be ready. Let not you lie with an
<>empty stomach. Eat this now”. So saying she placed
<>the bread in the hands of Bhartr2hari and left the room.
<NI>Bhartr2hari suspected foul play and mused “This bread
<>has been prepared by her with poison to kill me. It is
<>better to give up living with her. There is no doubt
<>about it. Of the four a1s4ramas the fourth, Sannya1sa, is
<>the best. It is pleasant and sorrowless. Therefore gra-
<>dually that a1s4rama should be accepted”. Thinking thus
<>he came out from his room with the bread and placed
<>it hidden somewhere in the lower end of the roof of the
<>house remarking “Ot2t2appam Vi1t2t2eccut2um” (The ot2t2at2a
<>will burn the house). Then taking an earthern bowl for
<>begging he left the house unnoticed by any. The moment
<>Bhartr2hari left the house the house caught fire and
<>everything in it was burnt to ashes.
<NI>Bhartr2hari renouncing all and changing himself into
<>the robes of a sannya1si1 went about living by begging.
<>After some time he decided that he would never beg but
<>would eat only that which others gave him voluntarily.
<>He had by that time reached a big temple
<F>2) This temple is believed to be the Chidam3baram3 Temple.</F> in south
<>India where in one of the entrances to the temple, the
<>east one, was sitting the famous sannya1si1 Pat2t2anatt
<>Pillaya1r. Bhartr2hari, therefore, went and sat at the
<>western entrance with his bowl before him. Whatever
<>food fell into the bowl was eaten by him. Sometimes
<>for days together he went without food. But he never
<>was sick or felt weak. [Page126-a+ 65]
<NI>One day a beggar went to the eastern gate and asked
<>Pat2t2anatt Pillaya1r for alms. Pillaya1r said, “I am also a
<>beggar like you. I have nothing in my hand to give you.
<>But there is a man sitting in the western gate. He is a
<>rich man and he may give you something”. The beggar
<>went to Bhartr2hari and asked for alms. Bhartr2hari
<>also expressed his helplessness in the matter. But then
<>the beggar said “The man sitting at the opposite entrance
<>told me that you were a rich man.” Bhartr2hari smiled.
<>He knew then why Pat2t2anatt Pillaya1r said so. A man who
<>has renounced everything need not keep even a bowl to
<>beg. The bowl was a luxury and a sign of wealth.
<>Bhartr2hari threw away the bowl and remained at the
<>temple entrance till the end of his life. It was while
<>sitting there that he wrote his famous poems.
<NI>4) His well-known works are: (1) The Ni1ti S4ataka (2)
<>The S4r2n3ga1ra S4ataka (3) The Vaira1gya S4ataka and (4)
<>The Subha1s2itas.
<HI>BHARTR2STHA1NA(M). A very holy place in ancient

<>place would get the benefit of performing an As4vamedha

<>to Kas4yapa, who distributed them among several Devas.
<>Bha1ru was the woman so given to the Vis4vadevata1s.
<>(Hari Vam3s4a, Chapter 3).
<HI>BHARUKA. A king of the Solar dynasty. He was the
<>son of Sudeva and father of Ba1huka. (Navama Skanda,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>BHARUKAKS2A(M). A village of ancient India.
<>S4u1dras lived there. At that time of the Ra1jasu1ya of
<>Dharmaputra these S4u1dras brought gifts to the King.
<>(Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>BHA1RUN2D2A. A particular kind of bird found in the
<>Kingdom called Uttarakuruvars2a. These birds carry in
<>their strong beak corpses to their caves and eat them.
<>(Bhi1s2maparva, Chapter 7, Verse 12).
<HI>BHA1RYA1. Wife. Bhi1s2ma points out the sanctified impor-
<>tance of Bha1rya1 (wife) as follows:--
<NI>Without her even the palace will prove itself to be just a
<>forest. She will be a great support (to the husband) in
<>the matter of dharma (duty) artha (wealth) and Ka1ma
<>(enjoyment of material comforts). (These three precede
<>the ultimate state of Moks2a (salvation) and the wife will
<>be a great support in fulfilling the conditions during the
<>first three stages.) While on tour in foreign places she
<>will remain faithful to him and instil confidence in him.
<>Bha1rya1 is great wealth to man.
<NI>In his forlorn life on earth the wife is of great help to
<>man. To him, who is suffering from diseases and is
<>otherwise in distress there is no remedy (medicine) like
<>a good wife. There is no relative like a wife. In the
<>matter of practising dharma there is no other support to
<>match the wife. If one has no good wife to take care of
<>domestic affairs one will be driven to the forest; the
<>home will be like a forest. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 144).
<HI>BHA1SA. A very prominent dramatist in Sanskrit. As
<>Ba1n2a and Ka1lida1sa have noticed him in their works,
<>it may safely be assumed that Bha1sa lived in an earlier
<>period. Since Pratima1 na1t2aka and Abhis2eka na1t2aka,
<>which are universally admitted to have been composed
<>by Bha1sa, depend for their themes on the Va1lmi1ki [Page126-b+ 65]
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, it is clear that Bha1sa lived after Va1lmi1ki.
<>Ka1lida1sa's period has not yet been fixed beyond doubt.
<>It is almost settled that Ba1n2a lived sometime between the
<>sixth and seventh centuries A.D. Prof. Keith has been
<>of the view that Va1lmi1ki lived before the 4th century
<>B.C. In the light of all such factors it could be presumed
<>that Bha1sa lived in the period between the 4th century
<>B.C. and 6th century A.D.
<NI>Though Bha1sa has so many glories to his credit he does
<>not fully match Ka1lida1sa, and this might have been the
<>reason why Indians did almost forget Bha1sa with the
<>advent of Ka1lida1sa on the literary arena.
<NI>We are not in a position to name with unerring definite-
<>ness the works of Bha1sa. The general belief is that he
<>has written nearly twenty three dramas. In 1922, Pandit
<>Gan2apati S4a1stri1 unearthed from various sources thirteen
<>dramas of Bha1sa. Three out of them, viz. Pratijn5a1-
<>yaugandhara1yan2a, S4vapnava1savadatta and Avima1-
<>raka owe their themes to the Br2hatkatha1, while Prati-
<>ma1 na1t2aka and Abhis2eka na1t2aka have Ra1ma1yan2a as
<>their basic inspiration. Out of the eight remaining
<>dramas six, viz. Madhyama vya1yoga, Pan5cara1tra, Du1ta-
<>va1kya, Du1taghat2otkaca, Karn2abha1ra and U1rubhan3ga
<>owe their themes to the Maha1bha1rata, while the last
<>two dramas, Ba1lacarita and Ca1rudatta are dependent
<>for their themes on anecdotes about S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and on
<>yaks2a stories.
<NI>Though Dr. Gan2apati S4a1stri1 has strongly contended that
<>all the above thirteen dramas were written by Bha1sa
<>himself, his view has not yet received universal accep-
<>tance. Whatever that be, it is an admitted fact that
<>Svapnava1savadatta is by far the best among the thirteen
<>dramas. It is a continuation of the story of Pratijn5a1yau-
<>gandhara1yan2a. The wedding of king Udayana and
<>Va1savadatta1 is the subject matter of Svapnava1sava-
<>datta.
<NI>With his killing of the Ra1ks2asa ‘Avi’ the Sauvi1ra king
<>comes to be known as Avima1ra, and Avima1ra's falling
<>in love with Kuran3gi1, daughter of Kuntibhoja forms the
<>theme of the drama, Avima1raka. In Pratima1 na1t2aka
<>is told the story narrated in Ra1ma1yan2a from Ayodhya1-
<>ka1n2d2a to Pat2t2a1bhis2eka. Abhis2eka na1t2aka codifies the
<>stories in the Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a and Sundara Ka1n2d2a of
<>the R2a1ma1yan2a and describes the coronations of Sugri1va
<>and of S4ri1 Ra1ma. Though the characters in Pan5cara1tra
<>are borrowed from Maha1bha1rata the story is entirely
<>Bha1sa's. Madhyama vya1yoga, Du1tava1kya, Du1taghat2ot-
<>kaca, Karn2abha1ra and U1rubhan3ga are one-act plays.
<>These five plays have as their basis some of the anecdotes
<>in the Maha1bha1rata. In Ca1rudatta is treated the love
<>story of Ca1rudatta and Vasantasena1.
<NI>Indisputable evidence is still lacking to credit Bha1sa
<>with the authorship of all the thirteen plays referred to
<>above.
<HI>BHA1SAS. (See Bha1si1).
<HI>BHA1SAKARN2A. A military captain of Ra1van2a. Hanu-
<>ma1n killed him in fight. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a 46, 47).
<HI>BHA1SI1. Daughter of Ta1mra1, Daks2a's daughter. Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati married the following daughters of Daks2a:
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1, Ta1mra1 had five daughters, viz. Kraun5ci1,
<>Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. And, the sons of
<>Bha1si1 are the Deva sect called the Bha1sas. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, A1ran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14). [Page127-a+ 65]
<HI>BHA1SKARA. One of the Dva1das4a1dityas born of Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati and Aditi. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Verse 150).
<HI>BHA1SKARA1CA1RYA. A master astronomer of ancient
<>India. It was he who declared, much earlier than western
<>experts, that the earth is round in shape.
<HI>BHA1SKARI. An old mahars2i of India. He accompanied
<>the R2s2is who visited Bhi1s2ma on his bed of arrows. (S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 47, Verse 12).
<HI>BHASMA. (Sacred ash). To know a story about the
<>greatness of Bhasma see under the word Durjaya.
<HI>BHASMA1SURA. A demon. There is no mention about
<>this demon in any of the Sanskrit pura1n2as but ‘S4ivali1-
<>la1mr2ta’ in Mara1t2hi contains the following story about
<>him.
<NI>Bhasma1sura was born of the Bhasma dust (ashes) on
<>the body of S4iva. Pleased at the great devotion of the
<>demon towards him S4iva asked him to name any boon
<>he wanted. Bhasma1sura said that he wanted the power
<>to burn to ashes anybody on whose head he placed his
<>hand. Bhasma1sura became arrogant with the boon
<>and he became a nightmare to the whole world. Then
<>Maha1vis2n2u appeared before him in the form of Mohini1,
<>an attractive dancer and alluring him by her charm
<>started on a dance called Muktanr2tya. During the course
<>of this dance Bhasma1sura was forced to place his hand
<>on his own head and the moment his head touched his
<>head he was burnt to ashes.
<HI>BHA1SVARA. One of the two attendants presented by
<>Su1rya to Subrahman2ya; the other was named Subh-
<>ra1ja. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 31).
<HI>BHAT2T2ANA1RA1YAN2A. A sanskrit poet who flourished
<>near about A.D. 700. Ven2i1sam3ha1ra, a drama in six
<>acts is the only composition of his found out, yet. He
<>is also known by another name, Mr2gara1jalaks2ma.
<>Certain scholars opine that he might have lived before
<>Ba1n2a and after Va1mana.
<HI>BHAT2T2ANA1YAKA. A literary critic who flourished in
<>the 10th century A.D. in India. He composed a critical
<>study on the science of dance (Na1t2ya) named Hr2daya-
<>darpan2a based on the Na1t2ya s4a1stra of Bharata. But,
<>the book has not been found out, yet. Contesting the
<>dhvaniva1da (the rhetorical theory that in poetry sugges-
<>ted or implied meaning is superior to the explicit mean-
<>ning) of A1nandavardhana1ca1rya, he established the rasa-
<>va1da (that sentiment is supreme in poetry). Abhi-
<>navagupta also has supported the rasava1da. Hence,
<>it may be inferred that Bhat2t2ana1yaka lived in the period
<>after A1nandavardhana and anterior to Abhinavagupta.
<>Bhat2t2ana1yaka's theory is that Abhidha1, Bha1vakatvam3
<>and Bhojakatvam3 should be the three excellences of
<>good poetry.
<HI>BHAT2T2I. A sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th century
<>A.D. His most important composition is the Maha1-
<>ka1vya, Ra1van2avadha, which has become very popular
<>and famous by the name Bhat2t2ika1vya. This maha1ka1vya
<>deals with the story of Ra1ma1yan2a in its twentytwo
<>Ka1n2d2as (cantos). The ka1vya is believed to have been
<>composed at Valabhi1 in obedience to the request of
<>King S4ri1dharasena.
<HI>BHAUMA I. The fourteenth Manu. In the time of this
<>Manu, the person called S4uci will be Indra. Under his
<>control there will be five groups of Devas. These groups
<>are called Ca1ks2us2as, Pavitras, Kanis2t2has, Bhra1jikas
<>and Va1pa1vr2ddhas. The Saptars2is (seven sages) of that
<>Manvantara are Agniba1hu, S4uci, S4ukra, Ma1gadha, [Page127-b+ 65]
<>Agni1dhra, Yukta and Jita. At that time, the sons of
<>Manu who will be protecting the earth will be U1ru,
<>gam3bhi1rabuddhi and other Kings. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>3rd Part, Chapter 2).
<HI>BHAUMA II. Another name of Naraka1sura. (See the
<>word Naraka1sura).
<HI>BHAUMA III. A Ra1ks2asa born to Sim3hika1 by Vipracitti.
<>Paras4u-Ra1ma killed him. (Brahma1n2d2a--3-6-18-22).
<HI>BHAUTYA. See the word Manvantara.
<HI>BHAVA I. One of the eleven Rudras. He was the son of
<>Stha1n2u and grandson of Brahma1. (Chapter 66, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHAVA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. (Chapter 60, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHAVA III. One of the sons born to Kas4yapa of Sura-
<>bhi.
<HI>BHA1VA(M) I. A famous forest mentioned in the
<>Pura1n2as. Bha1va was near the Ven2umanda mountain,
<>which was close to Dva1raka1. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>BHA1VA. One of the twelve Devas born to Bhr2guva1run2i
<>R2s2i of his wife Divya1.
<HI>BHAVABHU1TI. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th
<>century A.D. His important works are the three dramas,
<>Ma1lati1ma1dhava, Maha1vi1racarita and Uttarara1ma-
<>carita. Bhavabhu1ti was a brahmin of the Kas4yapa-
<>gotra. He was the son of one Ni1lakan2t2ha and one Ja1tu-
<>karn2i1. He was a great devotee of S4iva and he got his
<>name Bhavabhu1ti later because of this. His original
<>name was Ni1lakan2t2ha. Bhavabhu1ti was born in Padma-
<>pura in the state of Vidarbha. But Bhavabhu1ti spent
<>most of his life in the palace of Yas4odharma1, king of
<>Kannauj.
<NI>Bhavabhu1ti's first drama is believed to be Maha1vi1ra-
<>carita. There are seven acts in this. The theme is based
<>on the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma. But there are some variations
<>from the original Ra1ma1yan2a in this drama. Bhava-
<>bhu1ti states that even at the time of the svayam3vara of
<>Si1ta1, Ra1van2a was a suitor. There is an opinion among
<>certain critics that Bhavabhu1ti did write only up to the
<>46th verse in the fourth act and the rest was written
<>by another poet named Subrahman2ya.
<NI>Ma1lati1ma1dhava is a drama of ten acts. It is a love-story
<>of Ma1lati1 and Ma1dhava. Ma1lati1 was the daughter of the
<>minister of Ujjayini1 and Madhava was the son of the
<>minister of Vidarbha. It was while Ma1dhava was having
<>his education in Ujjayini1 that he came to love Ma1lati1.
<>It was Ka1mandaki1 who was a classmate of both the
<>ministers and who became a sannya1sini1 later who pulls
<>the strings of this love story. The king of Ujjayini1 wanted
<>Ma1lati1 to marry Nandana, a friend of his. But Ma1lati1
<>did not love him. Yet afraid of getting the displeasure of
<>the King, Ma1lati1's father decided to give her in marriage
<>to Nandana. In despair Ma1dhava was about to commit
<>suicide when from the temple nearby Ma1dhava heard
<>an agonised weeping. He rushed to the site of the sound
<>and found to his bewilderment the gruesome sight of
<>Ma1lati1 being dragged for sacrifice by a sorceress named
<>Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 helped by her guru Aghoraghan2t2a.
<>Ma1dhava killed Aghoraghan2t2a and saved Ma1lati1.
<>Disappointed Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 swore that she would
<>seek revenge on Ma1dhava and disappeared. Ma1lati1
<>went back to her palace. At this time Madayantika1,
<>sister of Nandana and Makaranda, a friend of Ma1dhava
<>became lovers. Once Madayantika1 was attacked by a
<>tiger in a S4iva temple and Makaranda saved her from [Page128-a+ 63]
<>the wild beast, and they became lovers thereafter. The
<>proposal to give Ma1lati1 in marriage to Nandana was
<>still pending then. The marriage day was fixed and a
<>day before that by a clever ruse played by the keen-
<>witted Ka1mandaki1 Ma1lati1 and Ma1dhava eloped together.
<>Makaranda, friend of Ma1dhava, was disguised and dressed
<>in bridal robes and Nandana little suspecting the trick
<>played on him married the substitute. Before they went
<>to the bridal chamber for the night Nandana's sister
<>came to see her new sister-in-law and the moment she
<>put her eyes on her she understood who it was and that
<>night they also eloped. Thus poor Nandana was left
<>alone.
<NI>Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 by her sorcery separated Ma1lati1 from
<>Ma1dhava but luckily Sauda1mini1 a disciple of Ka1man-
<>taki1 saved her from Kapa1lakun2d2ala1. Later Ma1lati1
<>married Ma1dhava with the permission of the King.
<>This is the story of Ma1lati1-Ma1dhava.
<NI>Uttarara1macarita is a play of seven acts. The theme is
<>the story of Ra1ma after his return to Ayodhya1 after the
<>exile. It begins with the renouncement of Si1ta1 by Ra1ma
<>and ends with the vanishing of Si1ta1.
<NI>All these three dramas used to be enacted during the
<>festival of ‘Ka1lapriyana1tha’ at Ujjayini1. The predomi-
<>nant emotion in Maha1vi1racarita is ‘Vi1ra’, in Ma1lati1-
<>Ma1dhava, ‘Sr2n3ga1ra’ and in Uttarara1macarita ‘Karun2a’.
<>In expressing and elaborating the emotion of ‘Karun2a’
<>Bhavabhu1ti excels Ka1lida1sa. The one draw-back which
<>keeps him second to Ka1lida1sa is his lack of humour and
<>wit. The sanskrit poet Dhanapa1la in his book’
<>‘Tilakaman5jari’ speaks about Bhavabhu1ti thus:
<Poem>Spas2t2abha1varasa1 citraih2
<>Padanya1saih2 pravarttita1 /
<>Na1t2akes2u nat2astri1va
<>Bha1rati1 Bhavabhu1tina1 //</Poem>

<HI>BHA1VANIKA1. A companion of princess Mr2gam3ka1vati1.
<>(See S4ri1datta).
<HI>BHAVATI. The word prescribed by Manu to be used

<>tives and the wives of others should be addressed using
<>any one of the following words: Bhavati, Subhage or
<>Bhagini.
<Poem>Parapatni1 tu ya1 stri1 sya1d
<>asambaddha1 ca yonitah2 /
<>Ta1m3 bru1ya1d bhavati1tyevam3
<>Subhage bhagini1ti ca. //</Poem>
<>(Manusmr2ti, Chapter 2).
<HI>BHA1VAYAVYA. A muni, whose glories are sung in the
<>R2gveda. He married Romas4a1, daughter of Bhr2haspati.
<>Once she approached her husband with the request for
<>coition, and the husband laughed at her. (R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 19, Anuva1ka 19, Su1kta 127).
<HI>BHA1VINI1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya. (S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 44, Verse 11).
<HI>BHAVIS2YA PURA1N2A. This pura1n2a contains the instruc-
<>tions given by the god Su1rya to Manu. There are about
<>fourteen thousand books in this pura1n2a and they deal [Page128-b+ 65]
<>with almost all subjects on earth including such impor-
<>tant ones like, Sr2st2i (creation), Ka1lama1na (time),
<>Garbha1dha1na (conception), Goda1na (gift of cows),
<>A1s4ramadharmas (duties of a hermit) Lin3ga S4a1stra
<>(science of sex), Vis2acikitsa1 (treatment of poisoning)
<>and A1yurveda (Medical science). (Chapter 272, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHAVIS2YARA1MA1YAN2A. The part after Uttarara1ma1-
<>yan2a. Uttarara1ma1yan2a states about Bhavis2yara1ma1yan2a
<>being sung by Kus4a and Lava in the presence of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma.
<HI>BHA1VUKA. A king of the solar dynasty. He was the
<>son of Ravi1ya and father of Cakroddhata. (Bha1gavata,
<>Navama Skandha).
<HI>BHAVYA I. A son of Dhruva. He got of his wife S4ambhu
<>two sons, S4is2t2i and Bhavya. (Chapter 13, Am3s4a 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHAVYA II. A clan of devas in Raivatamanvantara.
<>Parimiti, Priyanis4caya, Mati, Mana, Vicetasa, Vijaya,

<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>BHAYA(M). Him3sa1 is the wife of Adharma. They got
<>a son named Anr2ta and a daughter named Nikr2ti. From
<>them were born Bhaya, Naraka, Ma1ya1 and Vedana1.
<>Of these Ma1ya1 produced Mr2tyu, destroyer of matter.
<>Vedana1 got of her husband Raurava son named Duh2kha.
<>From Mr2tyu were born Vya1dhi, Jara1, S4oka, Tr2s2n2a1
<>and Krodha. (Chapter 20, Agni Pura1n2a). Another
<>version about the birth of Bhaya is found in S4loka 54,
<>Chapter 66 of A1di Parva, M.B. Adharma married Nirr2ti1
<>and to them were born Bhaya, Maha1bhaya and Mr2tyu,
<>three sons of demoniac disposition. These three sons
<>led a sinful life.
<HI>BHAYAN3KARA I. A prince of the country of Sauvi1ra.
<>He was a dependant of Jayadratha. It was this Bhayan3-
<>kara who followed Jayadratha with his flag when he

<>and has composed a work on A1yurveda, entitled ‘Bhela-
<>sam3hita1’.
<HI>BHERI1SVATA1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 26).
<HI>BHI1MA. Bhi1masena, one of the five Pa1n2d2avas.
<F>1) Since much information about Bhi1ma is given under the captions Dharmaputra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pa1n5ca1li1 only
<>a brief description of Bhi1ma is attempted under the present heading.</F>
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See genealogy of Arjuna).
<NI>2) {%Birth and childhood.%} King Vicitravi1rya of Candra
<>vam3s4a (lunar dynasty) had two sons called Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u. The Kauravas (Duryodhana etc.) were
<>sons born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of his wife Ga1ndha1ri1, and the [Page129-a+ 65]
<>Pa1n2d2avas were the sons of Pa1n2d2u and his wives Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1. Dharmaputra, Bhi1ma and Arjuna were
<>the sons of Kunti1, and Nakula and Sahadeva of
<>Ma1dri1.
<F>1) The Pa1n2d2avas were not in fact direct issues of Pa1n2d2u. For details see Kunti1.</F>
<NI>Kunti1 directed a mantra gifted to her by Durva1sas to-
<>wards Va1yubhagava1n (the wind-god) and the result
<>was the birth of Bhi1ma. Hence he is called Va1yu-putra
<>(son of the wind-god). At the time of his birth a celestial
<>voice announced that the boy would grow up to be the
<>strongest among the strong. (A1di Parva, Chapter 122,
<>Verse 14). On the tenth day after birth the child Bhi1ma
<>fell from his mother's lap on a rock. Bhi1ma was not
<>injured in any manner by that fall, although it crushed
<>the rock into power. (This story is told in the southern
<>texts of the Maha1bha1rata in Chapter 132 of A1di Parva).
<>The naming ceremony of the child was performed by
<>the Mahars2is, who stayed at S4atas4r2n3ga. Kas4yapa Maha-
<>rs2i, family priest of Vasudeva performed the ceremonies
<>like wearing of the sacred thread. Bhi1ma learned fight-
<>ing with the gada1 (club or mace) from S4uka, the famous
<>Ra1jars2i.
<NI>The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas spent their childhood
<>in Hastina1pura. Dron2a1ca1rya taught them fighting
<>with weapons. The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas often
<>engaged themselves in children's games. In all such
<>games Bhi1ma used to hurt and defeat the Kauravas,
<>and to this fact the unending hatred of the Kauravas
<>towards Bhi1ma owed its origin. Once they adminis-
<>tered poison to Bhi1ma who fell down unconscious, and
<>then they threw him into the depths of the Gan3ga1
<>(Ganges). Going deeper and deeper in the waters
<>Bhi1ma, at last, reached the Na1galoka, where the na1gas
<>(serpents) bit him which neutralized the effects of the
<>poison in his body. There he got acquainted with a
<>na1ga called A1ryaka, who introduced him to Va1suki,
<>king of the na1gas, and Va1suki presented him with much
<>wealth and other costly gems. But, what use was all
<>this wealth to Bhi1ma? Then Va1suki agreed to give him
<>a divine drink, which would give the user of it the
<>strength of thousand elephants. Bhi1ma drank at one
<>draught eight pot-fulls of that divine drink, and thus
<>became tremendously strong. But, he had to wait in
<>Na1galoka for eight days so that the drink might be
<>thoroughly assimilated, and on the ninth day the na1gas
<>saw him off in all pomp and splendour. Bhi1ma returned
<>to his mother and brothers and consoled them, who
<>were terribly anxious at his absence.
<NI>When the training of the princes in the use of weapons
<>was over a competition or test was conducted. Duryo-
<>dhana and Bhi1ma entered into a ‘club-fight’, and when
<>Karn2a tried to intervene in the fight his nobility was
<>questioned by Bhi1ma. Duryodhana then insulted Bhi1ma.
<>Arjuna agreed to present King Drupada before Dron2a1-
<>ca1rya as gurudaks2ina1 to him. In the fierce war the
<>Pa1n2d2avas fought with Drupada, Bhi1ma annihilated the
<>elephant division of the latter's army. And, afterwards
<>Bhi1ma underwent higher training in club-war at the
<>hands of Balabhadrara1ma. (A1di Parva, Chapter 136,
<>Verse 4).
<NI>3) {%The Pa1n2d2avas left Hastina1pura.%} As enmity between
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas began growing stronger
<>and stronger, Duryodhana, with his father's permission,
<>removed the Pa1n2d2avas to va1ran2a1vata and settled them
<>there. They were put up there in a palace specially [Page129-b+ 64]
<>made of lac. The Pa1n2d2avas divined the secret of it and
<>escaped from the fire, when the palace was set fire to.
<>Verse 10, Chapter 147 of the A1di Parva states that it
<>was Bhi1ma, who set fire to the palace. Escaping thus
<>through a tunnel the Pa1n2d2avas travelled a great distance
<>in the forest. Kunti1 and four of her sons got tired by the
<>exertions of the travel and were forced to sit down for
<>rest on the way. Bhi1ma, continued the journey carrying
<>the mother and his four brothers on his shoulders. With
<>their entry into Hid2im3ba forest the weakness left them,
<>and they became their former selves.
<NI>4) {%Hid2im3ba killed.%} Kunti1 devi1 and four sons slept under
<>the shade of a tree at dusk, and Bhi1ma kept guard over
<>them. There dwelt in the forest a Ra1ks2asa called Hid2im3ba
<>with his sister, Hid2im3bi1. Hid2im3ba looked around that
<>particular day from the top of a tree, and detecting
<>Bhi1ma his mouth watered. He deputed Hid2imbi1 to
<>bring Bhi1ma over to him. Hid2im3bi1 approached Bhi1ma,
<>whose fine figure kindled feelings of love in her. She
<>desired to have him as husband. Hid2im3bi1 having not
<>returned even after a long time Hidim3ba went over to
<>the spot, and there finding Hid2im3bi1 in love-talks with
<>Bhi1ma he got terribly angry. He wanted to kill Hid2im3bi1.
<>Bhi1ma, who could not suffer the killing of a woman in
<>his presence rushed against Hid2im3ba, The noise of the
<>fight awakened the other Pa1n2d2avas from sleep, and at
<>the instance of Arjuna, Bhi1ma killed Hid2im3ba. Thus
<>rendered helpless and forlorn Hid2im3bi1 again craved
<>Bhi1ma for love. On the suggestion of Kunti1, whose
<>heart melted at the sight of Hid2im3bi1's helplessness Bhi1ma
<>took her as his wife. But, one condition was stipulated
<>for their enjoying the honey-moon. The condition was
<>that they might enjoy honey-moon, from dawn to dusk
<>in the sky and on mountain tops, Hid2im3bi1, who was
<>endowed with magic powers carrying Bhi1ma with her.
<>And, after dusk Bhi1ma was to be returned to Kunti1.
<>Accordingly Bhi1ma and Hid2im3bi1 spent one year, and
<>to them was born a son called Ghat2otkaca. Promising
<>that he shall return when wanted, Ghat2otkaca with his
<>mother went into the forest. The Pa1n2d2avas also left
<>for the village called Ekacakra1. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>147-154).
<NI>5) {%Killing of Baka and the wedding of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} While at
<>Ekacakra1 Bhi1ma killed the Ra1ks2asa called Baka and
<>freed the people of the village from their distress.
<>Afterwards the Pa1n2d2avas attended the Svayamvara
<>(free choice of the husband by woman) of Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>who became their wife. There Bhi1ma defeated S4alya
<>in fight. And, the Pa1n2d2avas duly returned to Hastina1-
<>pura. (For details see Baka, Pa1n5ca1li1 and Arjuna).
<NI>6) {%Again to forest.%} On their return to Hastinapura the
<>Pa1n2d2avas took their residence in the palace built by
<>Maya. There Maya presented a magnificent club to
<>Bhi1ma. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 18). It was
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, lord of Dva1raka1 who served as the right hand
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. Jara1sandha, who was then King of
<>Magadha fought with Kr2s2n2a eighteen times and got
<>defeated. Yet he did not yield, and at last Kr2s2n2a decided
<>to do away with him. Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna and Bhi1ma, in
<>disguise, set out for Magadha. They entered Jara1sandha's
<>palace and challenged him to a duel. Bhi1ma and Jara1-
<>sandha clashed, and at the instance of Kr2s2n2a Bhi1ma
<>rent the latter in two and threw him on the ground.
<>Though Jara1sandha was alive again, Bhi1ma rent him [Page130-a+ 61]
<>in two and threw away the two parts to two places.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 24).
<NI>The main impediments and thorns in their way thus
<>having been removed, Dharmaputra decided to perform
<>Ra1jasu1ya. Bhi1ma was deputed to conquer all the king-
<>doms in the eastern part of India. Bhi1ma achieved the
<>object and returned with great wealth to Indraprastha.
<>Though Bhi1ma got ready to kill S4is4upa1la, who alone
<>refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Yudhis2t2hira,
<>he also yielded on the tactful advice of Bhi1s2ma. The
<>Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a went off quite successfully. It was
<>Bhi1ma, who, after the Yajn5a was over, took Bhi1s2ma and
<>Yudhis2t2hira to Hastina1pura. Afterwards, in the contest
<>in the game of dice played between Dharmaputra and
<>Duryodhana, the Pa1n2d2avas lost everything. The Kaura-
<>vas brought Pa1n5ca1li1 into the assembly hall and attempted
<>to strip her naked in public. Bhi1ma who got enraged at
<>this shouted that the hands of Yudhis2t2hira who played
<>dice should be burnt in fire. (A1di Parva, Chapter 68,
<>Verse 6). And, Bhi1ma took then and there the terrible
<>pledge that he would, with his hands stained by blood
<>from the chest of Dus4s4a1sana, who tried to rip Pa1n5ca1li1
<>naked, tie up Pa1n5ca1li1's hair which got untied in the
<>scuffle. He also swore that he would break the thigh of
<>Duryodhana. In uncontrollable rage Bhi1ma also shouted
<>that he would turn into ashes all those who took part in
<>the game of dice. Bhi1ma took also the vow that all the
<>Kauravas would be killed.
<NI>According to the terms and conditions laid down with
<>regard to the contest in the game of dice the Pa1n2d2avas
<>went into the Ka1myaka forest to live there for twelve
<>years and then to live incognito for one year.
<NI>7) {%Life in forest and life incognito.%} There lived in Ka1m-
<>yaka forest a Ra1ks2asa called Kirmi1ra, brother of Bala,
<>whom Bhi1ma had killed on an earlier occasion. Kirmi1ra,
<>who was awaiting an opportunity to avenge the murder
<>of his brother, now clashed with Bhi1ma in the forest.
<>Bhi1ma did very easily kill him. (For details see Kir-
<>mi1ra).
<NI>Thus the Pa1n2d2avas spent their days once again in the
<>Ka1myaka forest under the spiritual leadership of sage
<>Dhaumya. They thought about their lost kingdom.
<>Should they go to war against the Kauravas or should
<>they spend the rest of their lives in the exercise of dha1rmic
<>injunctions? At one time Bhi1ma advised Yudhis2t2hira
<>against war; but on another occasion he pleaded vehe-
<>mently in favour of war. It was during this time that
<>Arjuna went to the Hima1layas to please S4iva by penance
<>and get from him the Pa1s4upata1stra. (Arrow called
<>Pa1s4upata). The Pa1n2d2avas naturally got nervous and
<>upset at the rather long absence of Arjuna; Bhi1ma was
<>more anxious and sorry than the others. Then the
<>Pa1n2d2avas set out in search of Arjuna, and travelled upto
<>Mount Gandhama1dana. Then the party got so tired
<>that they could not proceed any further. Pa1n5ca1li1 fell
<>down fainting. Then Bhi1ma remembered Ghat2otkaca,
<>who appeared before his father (Bhi1ma) at once. As
<>directed by Bhi1ma Ghat2otkaca mounted the Pa1n2davas
<>on his shoulders and the journey continued. They
<>reached the A1s4rama of Narana1ra1yan2as, and rested there
<>for six days. One day the wind blowing from the north- [Page130-b+ 65]
<>east dropped near Pa1n5ca1li1 a Saugandhika flower. And,
<>Bhi1ma set out in the north-east direction to fetch saugan-
<>dhika flowers for Pa1n5ca1li1, who felt a special liking for
<>them.
<NI>Walking and walking Bhi1ma entered Kadali1vana.
<>Hanu1ma1n, his skin wrinkled and hair grey due to old
<>age, was living in this forest. He obstructed the path of
<>Bhi1ma. Hanu1ma1n awoke from sleep and raised his tail
<>with a terrific sound. Bhi1ma walked upto the place
<>whence the sound was heard.
<F>1. When raised, Hanu1ma1n's tail was as high in the sky as the flag of Indra, and produced a thunderous sound. As though the
<>mountains were vomitting through their mouth, the sound produced by the raising of the tail shook the mountains. Drowning the trumpeting of
<>excited elephants the sound reverberated all around the mountains. Hearing the sound Bhi1ma, his whole body horripilated entered the
<>forest in the direction of the sound. In the middle of Kadali1vana, on a mighty rock, Bhi1ma saw Hanu1ma1n.</F> (Vanaparva, Chapter
<>146). In the clash that ensued between Hanu1ma1n and
<>Bhi1ma the former came out victorious. Hanu1ma1n,
<>however, congratulated Bhi1ma and directed him on the
<>path to the saugandhika forest.
<NI>Bhi1masena reached the saugandhika forest, which was
<>being guarded by the Ra1ks2asas called Krodhavas4as.
<>Bhi1ma overcame them, collected the flowers and return-
<>ing with them stayed in the Badarika1s4rama with his
<>brothers and Pa1n5ca1li1. Here it was that Bhi1ma killed
<>Jat2a1sura. (For details see Jat2a1sura II).
<NI>Four years were thus spent; yet Arjuna had not returned.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas continued their journey northward.
<>On the 17th day they came to the A1s4rama of Vr2s2aparva1
<>in the Hima1layas. They were duly received by the
<>mahars2i, who directed them in their onward journey.
<>Continuing the journey they reached the A1s4rama of
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a whence, after crossing various mountain peaks
<>and still walking they reached Kubera's Alaka1puri1 when
<>a Yaks2a called Man2ima1n obstructed their further pro-
<>gress. Bhi1ma killed Man2ima1n and the other Yaks2as who
<>rushed to his support. Finally Kubera himself saw
<>Bhi1ma and blessed the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>While they were returning from Kubera's palace Bhi1ma
<>was caught by a python. But, it was really Nahus2a
<>transformed into a python on account of a curse. Bhi1ma
<>killed it and it assumed its original form as Nahus2a.
<>(See Agastya, Para 8). By this time Arjuna had obtained
<>Pa1s4upata1stra from S4iva and he duly returned to his
<>brothers, and the Pa1n2d2avas continued their journey in
<>the forest.
<NI>Meantime, knowing that the Pa1n2d2avas were put up in
<>Dvaitavana, the Kauravas started for their dwelling
<>place in a procession led by Duryodhana with the army
<>and camped nearly two furlongs away from a pool in
<>Dvaitavana. While thus camping Duryodhana clashed
<>with a Gandharva called Citrasena, who with a number
<>of his comrades came to the pool for water games,
<>and in the encounter the latter made Duryodhana
<>prisoner. Bhi1masena who witnessed the scene very much
<>laughed at Duryodhana. But, Arjuna intervened and
<>set free Duryodhana and others.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas again entered the Ka1myaka forest, and
<>it was at that time that Jayadratha abducted Pa1n5ca1li1.
<>Bhi1ma killed Kot2ika1sya who acted on behalf of Jaya-
<>dratha. (See Kot2ika1sya). Moreover Bhi1ma captured
<>Jayadratha, got his head shaved clean and declared that
<>he was a slave of Dharmaputra. It was here at Dvaita-
<>vana that Dharmadeva tested the Pa1n2d2avas, who had
<>gone to a nearby pool to fetch water; all the Pa1n2d2avas
<>except Yudhis2t2hira died at the pool, but were brought
<>back to life again. (See Dharmaputra, Para 7). The [Page131-a+ 64]
<>twelve years’ forest-life of the Pa1n2d2avas now came to
<>an end.
<NI>According to the advice of Dharmadeva the Pa1n2d2avas
<>selected the Vira1t2a palace for their life incognito, Bhi1ma-
<>sena assuming the name Vallava (Valala). And, here
<>Bhi1ma killed in a duel Ji1mu1ta, the pugilist. (See Ji1mu1ta
<>II). It was also here that Bhi1ma killed Ki1caka and the
<>Upaki1cakas. (See Ki1caka). On another occasion, at
<>the instance of Yudhis2t2hira Bhi1ma took Sudharma1, King
<>of Das4a1rn2a to Yudhis2t2hira captive; but he was later set
<>free. Next year the Pa1n2d2avas defeated Duryodhana in
<>the fight in connection with the theft of the cows of the
<>Vira1t2a King, and then they declared that their forest
<>life and life incognito were over.
<NI>8) {%Bhi1ma in the great war.%} Even after the return of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas after the forest life and life incognito the
<>Kauravas refused to give them half of the kingdom. So,
<>both the parties began preparations for war. Given here-
<>under is the main incident relating to Bhi1ma from this
<>period to the Svarga1rohan2a (going to Heaven) of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas after relinquishing the kingdom in favour of
<>Pari1ks2it, including their victory in war and the adminis-
<>tration of the country.

<>for compromise talks asked for the views of Bhi1ma about

<>by the latter. At last when Bhi1ma too was about to fall
<>down and die he asked the reason thereof, and Yudhis2-

<>The following story about him occurs on page 619 of
<>the Padmapura1n2a.
<NI>In the dva1para yuga there lived a S4u1dra called Bhi1ma,
<>who engaged himself in the profession of Vais4yas. An
<>outcaste from practices pertaining to S4u1dras he enjoyed
<>life with a Vais4ya woman. He was a terrible fellow, who
<>had killed many brahmins, and also enjoyed the wives
<>of many elderly people including his teachers. He was
<>a robber as well. Once he went to a brahmin house,
<>and with the object of robbing his wealth spoke to him
<>in a pathetic tone as follows:--“Respected sire, you
<>will please listen to my grievance. You appear to be kind-
<>hearted. Please give me some rice, or else I will die this
<>very moment.”
<NI>Brahmin:--“Oh hungry guest! There is no one here
<>to cook food. I shall give you daily some rice, which
<>you may cook yourself. I have neither father, mother,
<>son, brothers, wife nor any other relatives. All of them
<>are dead and gone. The unfortunate fellow that I am,
<>I am staying here alone. No servants or others here.”
<>Bhi1ma:--“Oh revered brahmin! I too am a lonely
<>person. I shall live here for ever serving you. I am a
<>S4u1dra.”
<NI>These words of Bhi1ma pleased the brahmin so much that
<>he cooked some food quickly and served the S4u1dra with
<>it. He stayed with the brahmin from that day onwards.
<>His idea was to rob the brahmin of his wealth at some
<>convenient time and get away. But, since he used to
<>pour on his head everyday the water with which the
<>brahmin's feet were washed he got redemption from all
<>his sins.
<NI>One night a thief got into the brahmin's room to steal his
<>earnings. Seeing the thief Bhi1ma rushed at him to give
<>him a good thrashing. But, the thief, in the twinkling
<>of an eye, cut off Bhi1ma's head and escaped from the
<>scene. At once there came down the attendants of Lord
<>Vis2n2u to lead Bhi1ma to Vaikun2t2ha. A divine chariot
<>drawn by Ra1jaham3sas (swans) also came down. Bhi1ma
<>got into the chariot and reached the abode of Vis2n2u.

<>penance of the hundred Bhi1mas that the difficulties
<>of people are lifted. (Vana Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 11).

<>the result of the curse of a muni. But, he iremembered
<>his previous existence, and, though turned into elephant

<NI>2) {%Birth and Boyhood.%} Bhi1s2ma's name in his boyhood was
<>Devavrata. He was the eighth son of S4antanu, a king
<>of the lunar dynasty and Gan3ga1devi1. This boy was the
<>human embodiment of Dyau, one of the As2t2avasus.
<>S4antanu, his father was the re-birth of another king,
<>Maha1bhis2eka. The story concerning this, as given in
<>the Maha1bha1rata is as follows:--
<NI>King Maha1bhis2eka after his death, attained Vis2n2uloka.
<>Once he went to visit Brahma1 at Satyaloka. At that
<>time Gan3ga1devi1 was also present in Brahma1's assembly.
<>In that pious atmosphere, a gentle breeze began to blow
<>and Gan3ga1devi1's clothes were slightly deranged. Just
<>at that moment, Maha1bhis2eka took a stealthy glance at
<>her and she also returned that glance. This was noted
<>by Brahma1 who turned both of them into human beings
<>by a curse. Gan3ga1devi begged pardon and Brahma1
<>lifted the curse and blessed her that the As2t2avasus would
<>come to the earth to be born as her sons and that after-
<>wards she could come back to Heaven. After that
<>Gan3ga1devi1 was born as a mortal woman in the world
<>under the name Gan3ga1 and she spent her days in the
<>forests near the Gan3ga1 river valleys.
<NI>In those days the ruler of the Lunar dynasty was a king
<>named Prati1pa. Having no children, he went to the
<>bank of the river Gan3ga1 and performed tapas there.
<>Gan3ga1devi1 who was moving about in the forests near-
<>by, saw the King deeply absorbed in his tapas. She
<>approached him and sat on his right thigh. She wanted
<>the King to be her husband. He explained to her that
<>the right thigh is the proper seat of a daughter-in-law [Page135-a+ 65]
<>and so she would become his son's wife in due course.
<>In course of time, Prati1pa had a son, S4antanu, born
<>to him. When S4antanu grew up into a young man, one
<>day he went for a hunt to the Gan3ga1-valley and there he
<>met Gan3ga1devi1. He fell in love with her at first sight
<>and courted her. Gan3ga1devi1 agreed to become his wife
<>on condition that he should not say anything to displease
<>her and if he violated that condition she would leave him.
<>The king accepted the condition and they became man
<>and wife.
<NI>At about that time, the wife of Dyo, one of the As2t2a-
<>vasus, happened to see the sacrificial cow of the sage
<>Vasis2t2ha and wished to have it. She expressed her
<>desire to her husband, Dyo. Dyo, with the other seven
<>vasus went and took away by force, Vasis2t2ha's cow.
<>Vasis2t2ha in his anger cursed the As2t2avasus to be born as
<>mortals. They repented and begged pardon from
<>Vasis2t2ha. The sage told them that all of them would
<>be born as the sons of Gan3ga1devi1 and all except Dyo,
<>who actually stole the cow, would return to Heaven
<>at the time of birth itself. As for Dyo, he would continue
<>to live in the world for a long time, as an adventurous
<>hero.
<NI>Gan3ga1devi1 became pregnant and gave birth to her first
<>child. She carried the child to the river Gan3ga1 and
<>threw it into the river. S4antanu who followed her up
<>to the river bank, did not say anything against her,
<>remembering his promise.
<NI>Seven children were born to her and she threw all of them
<>into the river in this way. When she gave birth to the
<>eighth child, S4antanu insisted that he would not allow
<>her to throw away that child into the river. As he had
<>violated the condition, the angry Gan3ga1devi1 left the
<>palace with her child. She named it Devavrata and
<>brought him up in the forest. The sage Vasis2t2ha and
<>Gan3ga1devi1 taught him all branches of knowledge.
<>Thirtytwo years later, the king went to the same forest
<>for hunting. He saw a handsome boy stopping the
<>flow of the river Gan3ga1. Getting interested in the boy,
<>the King approached him. But by that time he had
<>disappeared. The King prayed to Gan3ga1devi1 to give
<>back the child. She appeared with the child and after
<>handing over the child to him vanished. The king
<>returned to the palace with the child. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapters 95-100).
<NI>3) {%The name Bhi1s2ma.%} Devavrata was anointed, as
<>heir-apparent. One day King S4antanu reached the
<>forest near the Gan3ga1 river valley, for hunting. As he
<>was hunting, absorbed in the beauty of the forest scenery,
<>he felt the perfume of musk filling the air in the forest.
<>He wondered from where it could come. He went on
<>and on trying to find out the source of this smell until
<>he reached the cottage of a fisherman. The fisherman
<>had a daughter named Satyavati1. It was from her that
<>the fragrance of musk spread all around.
<F>1) Satyavati1's original name was Ka1li1. The fisherman got her from the stomach of a fish. (See the word Adrika1). Since she
<>had the smell of fish she got the name of “Matsyagandhi1.” She used to assist a fisherman in his work as a ferryman in the river Gan3ga1.
<>Once the sage Para1s4ara happened to get into her boat and he fell deeply in love with her. The sage removed the smell of fish from her and gave
<>her the perfume of musk instead. By this mystic power he created a mist at noon and under its cover, he had a sexual union with her. As
<>a result of it the child Kr2s2n2a (Vya1sa) was born. The child immediately left the mother to perform tapas in the forest after promising to
<>return to her whenever she wished for his presence. Although she gave birth to a child, Para1s4ara blessed that she would again remain a
<>virgin. The whole episode remained a secret. As usual, Satyavati1 returned to the fisherman's cottage in the evening and continued to
<>live with him. It is at this stage that S4antanu was attracted by the perfume of musk and came to the cottage where he met Satyavati1.</F> The king
<>fell in love with her at first sight. He asked the fisherman
<>to give the girl in marriage to him. But the brave fisher- [Page135-b+ 57]
<>man did not yield to the king's demand immediately.
<>He laid down several conditions, one of which was that
<>Satyavati1's sons should succeed to the throne of S4antanu.
<>The king was in a fix. Devavrata was the eldest son and
<>heir-apparent. To deny kingship to his sons would be
<>highly improper. Unable to find a solution to this diffi-
<>cult problem, the king returned to the palace, much
<>depressed and gloomy. There he avoided all company
<>and took to his bed, passing his time in sadness and
<>solitude.
<NI>When Devavrata knew about his father's condition, he
<>called the Ministers and asked them about it. They
<>told him everything in details. At once, without inform-
<>ing even his father, Devavrata went to the fisherman's
<>cottage on the bank of the river Gan3ga1 and begged for
<>Satyavati1 on behalf of his father. The fisherman repeated
<>his former condition. Devavrata agreed that Satya-
<>vati1's son shall be given the right of Kingship. The
<>fisherman pointed out that disputes were likely to arise
<>between Devavrata's sons and Satyavati1's children regar-
<>ding the right of succession to the throne. At once
<>Devavrata stood up and made a solemn pledge that he
<>would remain a bachelor for life. The fisherman gave
<>Satyavati1 to Devavrata to be taken to the King. Deva-
<>vrata took her to the palace and presented her to his
<>father. The King, when he came to know of the part
<>played by his son in the matter, rose from his bed and
<>embraced Devavrata with tears of joy and gratitude.
<>The gods showered flowers on the scene. Because he had
<>taken such a solemn oath, it was declared that hence-
<>forth he would be known by the name “BHI1S2MA”.
<>The loving father S4antanu also gave him a boon that
<>Bhi1s2ma would die only when he wished. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 100).
<NI>4) {%Affairs of the Kingdom in crisis.%} Two sons named
<>Vicitravi1rya and Citra1n3gada were born to Satyavati1 by
<>S4antanu, who died shortly afterwards. As desired by
<>Satyavati1, Bhi1s2ma crowned the boy Citra1n3gada as king.
<>Although Citra1n3gada's reign was a prosperous one, it
<>could not last long. Once a Gandharva named Citra1n3-
<>gada attacked him at Kuruks2etra and after a battle
<>which lasted for three years, the Gandharva Citra1n3gada
<>killed the King Citra1n3gada. It was Bhi1s2ma who per-
<>formed the funeral rites of the King Citra1n3gada. After
<>that Vicitravi1rya was crowned King.
<NI>It was at that time that the Svayam3vara of the three
<>daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1, Am3ba1, Am3bika1 and
<>Am3ba1lika1, was held. Bhi1s2ma thought that it would be
<>good if Vicitravi1rya married them. So Bhi1s2ma attended
<>that function. The presence of Bhi1s2ma who was an old
<>man, at the Svayam3vara, frightened the girls. The other
<>kings who were present, stopped him from entering
<>the place, since he had taken an oath to remain a life-
<>long bachelor. The old Bhi1s2ma stood up and spoke at
<>length about the eight different forms of marriage and
<>after defeating several kings like S4a1lva, he seized the

<>(For the rest of Amba1's story, see the word “Amba1”.
<NI>Vicitravi1rya married Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. He ruled
<>over the country for seven years at the end of which he
<>died of consumption. The dynasty faced a crisis, as
<>there was no one to succeed him. Satyavati1 approached
<>Bhi1s2ma with a suggestion to beget children by Vicitra-
<>vi1rya's wife. But Bhi1s2ma stood firmly on his solemn oath
<>to continue as a life-long bachelor. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Verse 100-104).
<NI>5) {%Bhi1s2ma's Wire Pulling.%} After that Satyavati1 sum-
<>moned Vya1sa to Hastina1pura and sons were born
<>to Ambika1, Amba1lika1 and their maid by him. Ambika1
<>gave birth to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Amba1lika1 gave birth to
<>Pa1n2d2u and the maid gave birth to Vidura. They grew
<>up and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra married Ga1ndha1ri1 and Pa1n2d2u
<>married Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. Duryodhana and his brothers
<>were born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, while the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>born to Pa1n2d2u. Pa1n2d2u died at the S4atas4r2n3ga vana and
<>Ma1dri1 observed sati1 by jumping into his funeral pyre
<>and burning herself alive. After that, the Kauravas
<>and Pa1n2d2avas who lived in the palace at Hastina1pura,
<>split up into two blocs. When the palace made of lac
<>was destroyed by fire, the Pa1n2d2avas went into the forest
<>and came back to the country after their marriage with
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. They ruled over the country with Indraprastha
<>as their capital. In the gambling contest between
<>Dharmaputra and Duryodhana, the Pa1n2d2avas lost their
<>kingdom and everything and so they went to the forest
<>again. They lived for twelve years in the forest and spent
<>one year incognito in the palace of the King of Vira1t2a.
<>At that time the Pa1n2d2avas reappeared in the battle
<>which took place as a result of the theft of King Vira1t2a's
<>cows by the Kauravas. Duryodhana asserted that he
<>would not give so much land to the Pa1n2d2avas as to put
<>a dot with a needle. With the failure of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's
<>mediation, the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas encamped on
<>the opposite sides of the field of Kuruks2etra, preparing
<>for a grim battle.
<NI>Bhi1s2ma was the chief protagonist in all these events
<>relating to the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas. At every stage
<>in the story we see Bhi1s2ma's influence. The main events
<>in which this superman who used to give shelter to
<>Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas alike, played a decisive role,
<>are given below:--

<>dha1ra, to ask for the hand of Ga1ndha1ri1, to be married to

<>11).

<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 1).
<NI>(7) He engaged Dron2a1ca1rya to teach archery to the
<>princes. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 77).
<NI>(8) He burst into tears and wept bitterly on hearing that
<>Pa1n2d2avas were burnt to death in the palace of lac and
<>was about to offer them ‘Jala1n5jali’. Just then, Vidura
<>came to him and secretly informed him that the Pa1n2d2avas
<>were not dead. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 149, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tya Pa1t2ha).

<>the Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 202).

<>Yajn5a. Dharmaputra had entrusted to Bhi1s2ma, the

<>powerful Kings to help S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Sabha1 Parva,

<>value and importance of pilgrimage. (Vana Parva,

<>terms with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 253,

<>King Vira1t2a, Bhi1s2ma arranged the regiments in order,
<>after sending Duryodhana to Hastina1pura. (Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 16).
<NI>(20) A grim fight took place between Arjuna who went
<>to help the Vira1t2a army and Bhi1s2ma. At last, it was the
<>charioteer who removed Bhi1s2ma, (who had fallen down
<>unconscious) from the battlefield. (Vira1t2a Parva,
<>Chapter 64).
<NI>(21) When the Kauravas were contemplating to fight
<>against the Pa1n2d2avas who had returned after their
<>incognito life, Bhi1s2ma ridiculed Karn2a and praised
<>Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 16).

<>greatness of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 49, verse 2).
<NI>(23) Duryodhana proposed to bind the hands and feet
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who was expected to come as the envoy of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Hearing this, Bhi1s2ma in great anger,
<>walked out of the council hall. (Udyoga Parva, Chap-
<>ter 88, Verse 19).
<NI>(24) Bhi1s2ma strongly advised Duryodhana to make a
<>treaty of peace with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 125, Verse 2).
<NI>(25) He declared that he would not kill the Pa1n2d2avas
<>but would kill 10,000 soldiers of the Pa1n2d2avas everyday.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156, Verse 21). [Page137-a+ 64]
<NI>(26) As desired by Duryodhana, Bhi1s2ma declared the
<>Rathi1s and Maha1rathi1s who belonged to the Kaurava
<>side. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 165-168).
<NI>(27) Bhi1s2ma described all the Maha1rathi1s of the Pa1n2d2ava
<>side to Duryodhana. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 169-

<NI>(30) Am3ba1 who was allowed by Bhi1s2ma to marry her
<>lover, King S4a1lva, was rejected by him and returned
<>to Bhi1s2ma again. But he did not accept her. Although
<>Paras4ura1ma pleaded with him on behalf of Am3ba1,
<>Bhi1s2ma did not marry her. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>178, Verse 32).
<NI>(31) In connection with Amba1's case, a duel was fought
<>on the field of Kuruks2etra between Bhi1s2ma and Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. Bhi1s2ma started the duel after asking for the
<>permission of Paras4ura1ma. Pleased with the fight, the
<>Vasus presented to Bhi1s2ma, the Prasva1pana arrow. But
<>he did not use that arrow against Paras4ura1ma, since
<>the gods and Na1rada prevented him from doing so.
<>At the request of the gods, pitr2s and Gan3ga1devi1, Bhi1s2ma
<>stopped the fight and prostrated at the feet of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 178-185).

<NI>From these lines we see that Bhr2gu was born from
<>Brahma1's skin (tvak). But in M.B. A1di Parva, 5th
<>Chapter, we find another version regarding his birth.
<>In that passage we read that Bhr2gu was born from
<>“Vahni” (fire). In the light of these two statements, we
<>may examine Bhr2gu's birth.
<NI>Bhr2gu had two incarnations. The first time he was born
<>from Brahma1's skin. In course of time, the sage Bhr2gu
<>became famous. In the Daks2aya1ga, this sage was pre-
<>sent as one of the R2tviks (officiating priests). On that
<>occasion, Sati1devi1 who was in rage and grief because
<>her husband (S4iva) was not invited to the ya1ga, commit-
<>ted suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. Hearing
<>about this, S4iva was enraged and the monster spirits who
<>emerged from his matted locks caught hold of the
<>R2tviks. Bha1gavata caturtha skandha says that the Bhu1ta
<>named Nandi1s4vara, who emerged from S4iva's locks,
<>caught hold of Bhr2gu and killed him.
<NI>Therefore the Bhr2gu who was born from Brahma1's
<>skin must be considered as having died at Daks2aya1ga.
<>Bhr2gu was born again in Vaivasvata Manvantara.
<>This second birth was at the famous Brahmayajn5a
<>of Varun2a. He was reborn from fire, as Brahma1's son.
<>This child who was born from Brahma1's semen which
<>fell in the sacrificial fire, was brought up by Varun2a
<>and his wife Cars2an2i1. Consequently Bhr2gu is referred
<>to as “Varun2aputra” and “Cars2an2i1putra” in some
<>Pura1n2as. Since he was born at Varun2a's ya1ga he is
<>sometimes called “Va1run2i1 Bhr2gu”.
<NI>3) {%Bhr2gu Vam3s4a. (Bhr2gu family).%} Each birth of Bhr2gu
<>gave rise to a separate family. They are given below
<>separately:--First birth: Bhr2gu and his wife Khya1ti
<>had a daughter Laks2mi1 and three sons, Dha1ta1, Vidha1ta1
<>and Kavi. Maha1meru's daughters, A1yati and Niyati
<>became the wives of Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1, respectively.
<>Two sons, Pra1n2a and Mr2kan2d2u were born to those two
<>couples. Ma1rkan2d2eya was born to Mr2kan2d2u and from
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya was born Vedas4iras. Pra1n2a had a son,
<>Dyutima1n who had a son Ra1java1n. From that Ra1java1n,
<>Bhr2gu Vam3s4a multiplied. The family tree of this first
<>Bhr2gu Vam3s4a is given below:--(See Vis2n2u pura1n2a,

<C1>Dyutima1n <C2>Ma1rkan2d2eya
<C1>Ra1java1n <C2>Vedas4iras
<NI>Second Birth: The second Bhr2gu Vam3s4a is the family
<>which took its origin from the second birth of Bhr2gu
<>as the son of Varun2a. Varun2a's son, Bhr2gu married
<>the woman, Puloma1. They had six children who were,
<>Bhu1ta, Cyavana, Vajras4i1rs2a, S4uci, S4ukra, and Savana.
<>By his first wife Bhu1ta1, he had his sons, “Eka1das4a
<>Rudras” (eleven Rudras) and “Rudra Pa1rs2adas” [Page140-a+ 58]
<>(Attendants of Rudra) and by his second wife Saru1pa1
<>he had a crore of Rudras. Cyavana had two wives,
<>Sukanya1 and A1rus2i. Aurva, a son was born to A1rus2i.
<>From Aurva was born R2ci1ka, from R2ci1ka Jamadagni
<>and from Jamadagni, Paras4ura1ma. Cyavana had a
<>son, Pravati, by his wife Sukanya1. Ruru or S4unaka was
<>the son of Pravati by the Apsara1 Ghr2ta1ci1. Ruru
<>and his wife Pramadvara1 had a son, S4aunaka. S4uka,
<>the son of Bhr2gu had two sons, Can2d2a and Alarka and
<>a daughter, Devaya1ni1. This is the second Bhr2gu Vam3s4a.
<F>1) Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama Skandha says that Bhr2gu had married two daughters of Daks2a. Maha1bha1rata Anus4a1sana Parva
<>Chapter 85, Verse 127 says that Bhrgu had seven sons, namely Cyavana Vajras4i1la, S4uci, Aurva, S4ukra, Varen2ya, and Savana.</F>

<>out between Devas and Asuras. In that war, not only
<>were the Asuras defeated but many of them were also
<>killed. Diti, the mother of the Asuras, with tears in her
<>eyes, complained to Bhr2gupati. Puloma1, Mother of
<>S4ukra, promised to find a remedy for this somehow.
<>She at once went to the forest and started a tapas for
<>the annihilation of the Devas. As the tapas gained
<>force, the Devas were alarmed and they sought the
<>protection of Maha1vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u used his
<>Vajra1yudha (Vajra weapon) against Bhr2gu's wife,
<>Puloma1. Under the stroke of Vajra she fell down, a
<>headless corpse. The enraged Mahars2i Bhr2gu cursed
<>Maha1vis2n2u to be born as a mortal in this world and to
<>suffer the pangs of separation from his wife. When the
<>curse was pronounced against Maha1vis2n2u, he directed
<>his weapon Cakra against the Mahars2i. Bhr2gu fied in
<>panic and at last begged pardon and prayed for shelter
<>to Maha1vis2n2u himself in the ocean of milk. Vis2n2u
<>withdrew his Cakra. Bhr2gu himself restored Puloma1
<>to life. To fulfil the condition of Bhr2gu's curse, Vis2n2u
<>agreed to incarnate in the world as S4ri1 Ra1ma, the son
<>of Das4aratha and to experience the pain of separation
<>from his wife. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>5) {%Bhr2gu kicked Vis2n2u.%} Long ago all the Mahars2is
<>joined together to perform a ya1ga on the bank of the
<>river Sarasvati1. A dispute arose among them as to who
<>was the most mighty among the Trimu1rtis. Some of
<>them voted for Brahma1, others declared that Vis2n2u
<>was more mighty than the other two, while a third
<>group stood for S4iva's superiority. They unanimously
<>elected Bhr2gu to ascertain and find out the truth of
<>the matter. [Page140-b+ 43]
<NI>Bhr2gu set out to Devaloka. First he went to Brahma1's
<>assembly. There, in the presence of Brahma1 who was
<>seated in the midst of many Munis, Bhr2gu took his seat
<>on a stool. Brahma1 was provoked by this act of disres-
<>pect. Bhr2gu left the place without a word and went to
<>S4iva's place. S4iva rose from his seat and approached
<>him to embrace and welcome him. Bhr2gu, shrank back
<>saying, “Do not touch me?” S4iva became angry and
<>was about to hit him with his trident when Pa1rvati1
<>stopped him.
<NI>Bhr2gu then turned his steps to Vaikun2t2ha, the abode of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. There he saw Maha1vis2n2u in a deep
<>slumber. Seeing Maha1vis2n2u whose task is the pre-
<>servation of the world, sleeping like an irresponsible
<>person, Bhr2gu gave him a kick on his breast. Vis2n2u
<>who sprang up suddenly, saw Bhr2gu standing before
<>him. He begged pardon of the sage. He declared that
<>he would carry Bhr2gu's footprint permanently on his
<>chest as a sign of his repentance for having shown dis-
<>respect to the Mahars2i. This foot-print still remains
<>on Vis2n2u's chest and is known by the name “S4ri1vatsa”.
<>In this way, the Munis came to the conclusion that
<>Maha1vis2n2u is the noblest of the Trimu1rtis. (Bha1gavata,
<>Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>6) {%The origin of Bhr2gu Ti1rtha.%} There is a sacred spot
<>called, “Bhr2gu Ti1rtha” on the western side of Das4a1s4va-
<>medha. It is here that Bhr2gu once offered tapas to S4iva.
<>Owing to the austerity of his tapas, his hair became
<>matted and discoloured. His body was completely
<>covered with earth heaped up by termites. When S4iva
<>was still not propitiated, Pa1rvati1 interceded with him
<>on behalf of Bhr2gu, S4iva agreed to bless Bhr2gu.
<NI>S4iva sent his bull to the place where Bhr2gu was sitting.
<>The bull in the course of its gambols broke up and des-
<>troyed the earthen covering on his body which was
<>made by the termites. Bhr2gu became angry and chased
<>the bull. But he was stunned by the sight of the bull
<>rising up to heaven through the air. A divine light
<>spread there. S4iva appeared before him and asked him
<>what boon he wanted. Bhr2gu prayed that the place
<>where he was doing tapas should become a holy spot.
<>S4iva granted his prayer and from that day, the place
<>became famous under the name “Bhr2gu Ti1rtha”. [Page141-a+ 62]
<>Brahma1 and other Devas and the Kinnaras still worship
<>this Bhr2gu Ti1rtha. All sin is removed by a mere sight
<>of this sacred Ti1rtha. Those who bathe in the holy
<>water of this place attain Heaven and they will not be
<>born again. Even by hearing about the greatness and
<>glory of this Bhr2gu Ti1rtha, one will be cleared of all
<>sins and find an easy way to S4ivaloka. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 20).
<NI>7) {%Other details.%} (1) It was Bhr2gu who gave the boon
<>for having progeny to Sagara, King of the solar dynasty.
<>Sagara, with his two wives, Kes4ini1 and Sumati, per-
<>formed tapas at Bhr2gu prasravan2a in the Hima1layas.
<>After a hundred years, Bhr2gu, who was pleased, blessed
<>the king that he would have numerous children by one
<>wife and one son who would be progenitor of a vam3s4a,
<>by the other wife. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>38th Sarga).
<NI>(2) Once when some Munis went to Dva1raka1, Sa1mba
<>and other Ya1davas mocked them and the Munis cursed
<>them. Bhr2gu was one of those Munis. (See the word
<>Sa1mba).
<NI>(3) Paras4ura1ma, after exterminating the Ks2atriya kings,
<>went to the A1s4rama of Bhr2gu, the founder of the family
<>and received his blessings. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 62).
<NI>(4) Bhr2gu Mahars2i was a prominent member in Yudhis2-
<>t2hira's assembly. (M.B. Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<NI>(5) He was also a member of Indra's assembly. It was
<>by Bhr2gu's brilliance that Indra's glory was heightened.

<NI>(6) Bhr2gu was a member of Brahma1's assembly also.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 19).
<NI>(7) Once Bhr2gu blessed his son R2ci1ka and his daughter-
<>in-law Satyavati1 that they would have children. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 116, Verse 35).
<NI>(8) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who went as the messenger of peace to
<>Hastina1pura, travelled in Daks2in2a1varta, along with the
<>sage Bhr2gu. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 83, Verse
<>27).
<NI>(9) Bhr2gu entered the scene of battle between the Kurus
<>and Pa1n2d2avas and tried to persuade Dron2a1ca1rya to
<>withdraw from the fight. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>190, Verse 34).
<NI>(10) Once Bhr2gu lectured on the origin of the earth,
<>Philosophy of life, etc. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>128).
<NI>(11) Bhr2gu explained to Bharadva1ja how the Pan5ca-
<>bhu1tas except the sky originated (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>183).
<NI>(12) Bhr2gu discussed in a logical manner, the principle
<>of life and the transmigration of the soul. (S4a1ntiparva,
<>Chapter 187).
<NI>(13) He made a critical examination of the merits and
<>defects of racial discrimination. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>187).
<NI>(14) Once Bhr2gu bestowed Brahminhood on a King
<>named Vi1tahavya. (M.B. Anus4a1sana. Parva, Chapter
<>30, Verse 57).
<NI>(15) He got the name “Bhr2gu” because he was born out
<>of fire. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 105).
<NI>(16) It was Bhr2gu who gave the necessary advice to
<>Agastya to depose Nahus2a from Indra's post. [Page141-b+ 63]
<NI>(17) There is a story that Nahus2a kicked Agastya on the
<>head while the latter was carrying Nahus2a's palanquin
<>and that Bhr2gu, who was hiding in Agasty's locks of
<>hair, cursed Nahus2a and changed him into a python.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 100).
<HI>BHR2GUTI1RTHA. A place made sacred by the perfor-
<>mance of tapas by Bhr2gu. (For more details see the
<>6th para under Bhr2gu).
<HI>BHR2GUTUN3GA. A peak on which the sage Bhr2gu
<>performed tapas. R2ci1ka had lived there with his wife
<>and children. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 61st
<>Sarga).
<HI>BHR2N3GI1. A Mahars2i who was a devotee of S4iva. Once
<>he went to Kaila1sa and began to go round S4iva to pay
<>homage to him. But since Pa1rvati1 and S4iva were sitting
<>together as one body, he could not go round S4iva sepa-
<>rately. He did not have much reverence for Pa1rvati1.
<>So he took the form of a female beetle (Bhr2n3gi1) and
<>bored his way through a hole made in the place where
<>their bodies were united and thus went round S4iva alone.
<>Pa1rvati1 was angry at this slight shown to her and cursed
<>him to become physically weak. His legs became so
<>weak that they were unable to support his body. So
<>he prayed to S4iva again and he blessed him with a third
<>leg. In this way Bhr2n3gi1 became a Mahars2i with three
<>legs. (Mahars2is).
<HI>BHR2S4UN2D2I. A fisherman. He used to earn his living
<>by theft.
<NI>Once when the Mahar2s2i Mudgala was passing through
<>a forest, Bhr2s4un2d2i stopped him. But in the presence of
<>the Brahmanic effulgence of the Mahar2s2i, the fisherman
<>was dazed. Mudgala took pity on Bhr2s4un2d2i and advised
<>him to worship Lord Gan2es4a.
<NI>From that time Bhr2s4un2d2i gave up his evil ways, and
<>accepting the advice of Mudgala, started the worship
<>of Gan2es4a with single-minded devotion. As a result
<>of it, an elephant's trunk began to grow from the middle
<>of his forehead. Bhr2s4un2d2i who thus acquired a shape
<>closely resembling Gan2es4a, was visited by Indra, mis-
<>taking him for Gan2apati. (Gan2es4a: 1.67).
<HI>BHU1(H2). In the creation of the world, the Lord broke
<>the beginningless “An2d2a” (the primal egg or seed)
<>and from it the sound “Om3” emerged. The first sound
<>of it was “BHU1H2”; the second was “BHUVAH2”;
<>and the third was “SVAH2”. So the combination “Bhu1r
<>Bhuvah2 Svah2” was formed. Then came the most
<>adorable and superlative effulgence of the creator
<>(Savita1). That radiance dried up all water. A little of
<>the water became a highly viscous substance. This
<>viscous matter gradually solidified and became the earth.
<>Where the an2d2a originally was became the source of
<>that supreme effulgence. As it was the first radiant
<>light, it came to be called A1ditya (a1di=first). The
<>great procreator Brahma1 seemed to emerge from the
<>centre of the an2d2a. The garbhajala (the water contai-
<>ned in the an2d2a) became the oceans and rivers of the
<>world. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 43).
<HI>BHUJAKET2U. A king who fought on the side of Dur-
<>yodhana in the Bha1rata Yuddha.
<HI>BHUJAN3GA. A son of Kadru1 by Kas4yapa praja1pati.
<HI>BHUJYU. A Ra1jar2s2i (royal sage), the son of Tugra.
<>King Tugra sent his son with an army across the sea to
<>conquer the enemies in a distant island. When the boat [Page142-a+ 64]
<>in which they sailed had reached mid-ocean, it was
<>caught in a storm and wrecked. The prince and the
<>soldiers sank into the sea. At that time the prince prayed
<>to the As4vins who saved Bhujyu from drowning and
<>carried him back to the palace in boats and chariots
<>travelling through the air. This story is given in the
<>R2gveda where the adventures of As4vins are describ-
<>ed. (R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 17th Anuva1ka, 116th
<>Su1kta.).
<HI>BHU1KAMPA. (Earthquake). The cause of earth-
<>quake according to ancient belief is given below:--
<>The earth is being supported and held in its position by
<>an elephant called Viru1pa1ks2a. When he feels the burden
<>too heavy he shakes his head and earth tremors follow.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 40th Sarga).
<HI>BHU1LIN3GA(M). A bird which lived on the opposite
<>side of the Hima1layas. The cry of this bird resembles
<>“MA1 SA1HASA”.
<F>1) Ma1 Sa1hasa = Do not act rashly.</F> But this bird lived by pecking at
<>and eating the flesh between the teeth of a lion. S4is4upa1la
<>mentioned this bird as an example to illustrate that
<>Bhi1s2ma's advice was at variance with his practice.
<>The bird exhorts people not to act in a rash way (Ma1
<>Sa1hasa) and at the same time acts rashly.
<HI>BHU1MANYU I. A king who was the grandson of King
<>Dus2yanta and the son of Bharata. From Maha1bha1rata
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 19, we see that he was
<>born by the blessing of Bharadva1ja. His mother was
<>Sunanda1, daughter of Sarvasena, King of Ka1s4i. When
<>Bhu1manyu grew up, his father Bharata entrusted him
<>with the affairs of the Kingdom. Bhu1manyu had six
<>sons by his wife Pus2karin2i1; they were Diviratha, Suhotra,
<>Suhota1, Sukavi, Suyaju, and R2ci1ka. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 33, we see that he had
<>another son Suhotra by a woman Vijaya1, a Da1s4a1rha
<>maid.
<HI>BHU1MANYU II. There is another Bhu1manyu, grandson
<>of Kuru, a King of the Lunar dynasty and son of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, mentioned in Maha1 Bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Verse 59.
<HI>BHU1MANYU III. A Deva Gandharva. He partici-
<>pated in the celebrations connected with Arjuna's birth.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 91, Verse 35).
<HI>BHU1MI I. The earth.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The Pura1n2as maintain that Bhu1mi has a
<>Devi1 (goddess). The births of Bhu1mi and its basic
<>goddess are in two different ways.
<NI>The Maha1bha1rata, (Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha) says that the
<>goddess Bhu1mi was the daughter of Brahma1 and that
<>she was married by Maha1vis2n2u. The earth on which
<>we live is the Mr2tpin2d2a of which the basic deity is this
<>Bhu1midevi1. Of the many versions given in the Pura1n2as
<>regarding the origin of earth, three are given below:--
<NI>1) Long ago, towards the end of the age of floods, the
<>earth was in a liquid state. At that time, S4iva cut open
<>his thigh and let fall a drop of blood in the water.
<>It assumed the form of an “an2d2a” (egg). S4iva took that
<>an2d2a and split it. A man came out of it. From him was
<>made Nature (Prakr2ti) for the creation of the Universe.
<>One half of the broken an2d2a became sky and the other
<>half became the earth. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha-
<>lam3baka, 2nd Taran3ga).
<NI>(2) Maha1vis2n2u lay on the surface of water which spread
<>everywhere in the beginning. A lotus sprang up from [Page142-b+ 62]
<>the navel of Vis2n2u and from its top Brahma1 was born.
<>Liquid matter began to flow out of Vis2n2u's ears on both
<>sides. From it were born two Ra1ks2asas named Madhu
<>and Kait2abha. They persecuted Brahma1. Maha1vis2n2u
<>woke up and killed Madhu and Kait2abha. The thick
<>fat of these Ra1ks2asas hardened into the earth. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u (Maha1vira1t2 Purus2a)
<>spread everywhere. In every pore of that Maha1vira1t2
<>who was lying on the surface of the water, there was a
<>Brahma1n2d2a. In course of time that Vira1t2 obtained mind.
<>That mind stood connected with each of the pores
<>equally. Later from it were formed the “Pan5camaha1-
<>bhu1tas”. From their combination was formed the Bhu1ta
<>called “Maha1 Pr2thvi1”. It was cut into many pieces
<>and each of the pieces was deposited in each pore.
<>It was these Pr2thvi1 pieces which became “Bhu1mis”
<>at the time of creation. At the time of the floods, these
<>Bhu1mis sank again into those pores as before. In each
<>of these Brahma1n2d2as, there are the earth, mountains,
<>forests, oceans, the seven islands, Himava1n, Meru,
<>Sun, Moon, Stars and other planets. Also, each of
<>them has its own Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and other Devas.
<>Since all the different Bhu1mis in all the Brahma1n2d2as
<>had been formed artificially, they all perish in the floods.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) Bhu1mi Devi1 (Goddess Earth) is the wife of Maha1
<>Vis2n2u. In Vara1ha Kalpa (Age of the Pig) the Asura
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a carried the Earth and Submerged it under
<>water. At once Maha1 vis2n2u appeared in the form of a
<>Pig and lifted up the Earth on its horns. When the Earth
<>floated on the surface of water like a lotus leaf, Bhu1mi
<>Devi1 who was pleased, stood up in her charming figure.
<>Maha1vis2n2u fell in love with her and with the brilliance
<>of a crore of suns, had sexual union with her for the
<>period of one Devavars2a. It is from that time that
<>Bhu1mi Devi1 became Maha1vis2n2u's wife. As a result
<>of their union, a son named Man3gala was born to
<>them.
<NI>Ghat2es4a is the son of Man3gala. Man3gala has another
<>name, Covva. After the birth of Man3gala, at the behest
<>of Lord Vis2n2u, all people began to offer worship to
<>Bhu1midevi1. Maha1vis2n2u himself first worshipped her
<>by reciting the mantra--“Om Hri1m3-S4ri1m3-Kri1m3-Vasu-
<>dha1yai Sva1ha1”. After that this mantra became popular
<>for worshipping Bhu1midevi1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<NI>Naraka1sura was Bhu1midevi1's son by Hiran2ya1ks2a, the
<>Asura. When Hiran2ya1ks2a, in the form of a pig, carried
<>Bhu1midevi1 on his horns to Pa1ta1la, the horns came in
<>contact with Bhu1midevi1 and she became pregnant.
<>In Bha1gavata, Das4ama Skandha we read that Naraka1-
<>sura was born as the result of this contact. (See the
<>word Naraka I).
<NI>Si1ta1 was the daughter of Bhu1midevi1, born on another
<>occasion. Si1ta1 was married by the Kosala King S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. When she was abandoned by her husband,
<>she was at last accepted by Bhu1midevi1 within her own
<>self. (See the word Si1ta1).
<NI>4) {%Bhu1mi and Prahla1da.%} Since Bhu1midevi1 had been the
<>wife of the Asura Hiran2ya1ks2a she has also been called
<>the mother of the Asura clan. Hiran2ya1ks2a's brother was [Page143-a+ 61]
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu. Prahla1da, the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu,
<>was a devotee of Vis2n2u. The father did not like the son's
<>devotion to Vis2n2u. So he persecuted Prahla1da in various
<>ways. Once he threw down Prahla1da from the top of
<>a high building. At that time Bhu1mi devi1 appeared there
<>and received him in her arms. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 24).
<NI>5) {%Bhu1midevi1 and Pr2thu.%} Once the Emperor Pr2thu
<>turned Bhu1midevi1 into a cow and milched all resources
<>from her. (For details, see the word Pr2thu).
<NI>6) {%Pa1rvati1's curse.%} Once Pa1rvati1 and S4iva indulged in
<>their sexual act for many years. The earth began to
<>shake to its foundations. The gods approached S4iva
<>with a request to refrain and he agreed. S4iva's semen
<>was discharged and fell on the earth. Pa1rvati1 who was
<>angry at this, cursed Bhu1midevi1 as follows:--“You
<>Bhu1midevi1! You will assume many forms and become
<>the wife of many. Since you have prevented me from
<>giving birth to a son, no children will be born to you
<>in future.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 36th Sarga).

<NI>(3) When Paras4ura1ma was carrying on the annihilation
<>of Ks2atriyas, Bhu1midevi1 induced the sage Kas4yapa to
<>entreat Paras4ura1ma to stop his massacre of Bhu1pa1las.
<>(Protectors of Bhu1mi=Ks2atriyas). (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 79, Verse 44).
<NI>(4) Once she (Bhu1midevi1) described to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>the greatness of Brahminhood. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 22).
<NI>(5) At another time she explained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the
<>nature of Gr2hastha1s4ramadharma, (Duties of a house-
<>holder). (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 97, Verse 5).
<NI>(6) On one occasion, when King An3ga touched her,
<>Bhu1midevi1 lost her own form and vanished. At that
<>time, Kas4yapa praja1pati paralysed her. (M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 152, Verse 2).
<NI>(7) Paras4ura1ma gifted the whole earth to the sage
<>Kas4yapa. From that time Bhu1midevi1 has been called
<>“Ka1s4yapi1” (daughter of Kas4yapa). (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 7).

<HI>BHUS4UN2D2A. A dispassionate and large-hearted crow.
<>The residence of this crow was a Kalpavr2ks2a standing
<>on a beautiful peak surrounded by luxuriant vegetation
<>in the north-eastern corner of Maha1meru. There were
<>numerous bird-nests on the southern branch of that
<>Kalpavr2ks2a. In one of them lived this centuries-old
<>bird.
<NI>Once when the sage Vasis2t2ha went to Devaloka, he
<>happened to hear about this crow. He went to see
<>Bhus4un2d2a in its nest. The crow recognised Vasis2t2ha
<>at once. They exchanged greetings. The sage opened
<>the conversation as follows:--“Oh, King of birds!
<>when were you born? How did you become a great
<>soul? How old are you? Have you recollections of the
<>past? Who was the prophet who suggested this residence
<>for you?”
<NI>The bird calmly replied as follows:--“If you are interes-
<>ted in hearing my past history I shall tell you. Lord
<>S4an3kara the Almighty lives in this world. He has numer-
<>ous attendant spirits. Besides these spirits who have
<>hoofs on their head, hands in the hoofs, teeth in
<>the hands and stomach in the face, and who have faces
<>resembling those of monkeys, camels, and elephants,
<>he has also hordes of Ma1tr2s in his retinue. The Ma1tr2s,
<>attended by spirits continue their dance in the presence
<>of the Lord. Mountain peaks, the sky, the different
<>worlds, deep pits, cremation grounds, etc. are their
<>haunts. Chief among these Ma1tr2s are eight sisters
<>named, Jaya1, Vijaya1, Jayanti1, Apara1hita1, Siddha1,
<>Rakta1, Alambus2a1 and Ulpala1. They have other follow-
<>ers also. Alambus2a1's vehicle is the crow named Can2d2a. [Page144-b+ 65]
<>All these Ma1tr2s assembled together on one occasion to
<>celebrate a festival in the sky. There was a display of
<>many kinds of entertainments at that time. Disputations
<>in spiritual matters, music, dancing, drinking and other
<>forms of hilarious activities were freely indulged in.
<>In another part of the sky, their vehicles were also
<>enjoying themselves with similar celebrations of drinking,
<>dancing, and merry-making. The swans who were the
<>vehicles of Bra1hmi1devi1 were dancing in one place,
<>intoxicated by drink. Can2d2a, the crow, who was Alam-
<>bus2a1's vehicle, also joined their company. Completely
<>absorbed in their delirious raptures, the intoxicated
<>swans indulged so freely in their amorous pleasures with
<>Can2d2a that they became pregnant. At last when the
<>merry-makings ended and all of them dispersed, the swans
<>became aware of their plight and informed Bra1hmi1
<>about it. The gracious goddess (Bra1hmi1) told them
<>that in their present state they were unable to discharge
<>their duties in drawing her chariot and so they were allow-
<>ed to go and enjoy themselves wherever they liked. After
<>this she entered into a trance. The swans in the fullness
<>of time, gave birth to twentyone sons. We, the twenty-
<>one brothers, are those children. We and our mothers
<>went to Bra1hmi1devi1 and offered worship to her for a
<>long time. As a result, the Devi1 woke up from her trance
<>and pleased with us, gave us her blessing. After that,
<>we went to our father (Can2d2a) and off red our devoted
<>services to him and prostrated before him and Alam-
<>bus2a1devi1. They blessed us. We asked our father to
<>suggest a most suitable place for a secluded life. This
<>Kalpa Vr2ks2a is the secluded place recommended by
<>him. We paid obeisance to our father and Alambu-
<>s2a1devi1 and came to settle down here. Many ages have
<>passed since then. Now your visit and holy presence
<>here, have liberated me from all worldly bonds and
<>ennobled my life. My twenty brothers lived for many
<>Kalpas and yugas at the end of which, convinced of the
<>meaninglessness of worldly life, renounced their bodies
<>and attained S4ivaloka.
<NI>On hearing this, Vasis2t2ha asked Bhus4un2d2a to tell him
<>more about his past life. Bhus4un2d2a resumed his story:--
<>“Long long ago, the whole earth was full of big rocks,
<>without trees, forests or mountains. After a great flood
<>the surface of the earth was covered with ashes. In
<>one caturyuga (a period equal to the length of the four
<>yugas, Kr2ta, treta1, dva1para and Kali) the earth was
<>filled with forest trees and in another Caturyuga, moun-
<>tain ranges appeared. I have seen an age in which
<>Bra1hman2as were drunkards, S4u1dras were virtuous and
<>women of noble families committed adultery. You
<>have now been born in the eightieth “Janma” as the
<>son of Brahma1. You were born once from the sky, at
<>another time from water, then from the mountain and
<>again from fire. I can remember this earth sinking into
<>the ocean five times and Lord Vis2n2u taking the form of
<>a tortoise, lifting it up, above the water. I have seen the
<>ocean of milk being churned twelve times. I know that
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a had taken the earth three times to Pa1ta1la
<>(underworld). The Lord has incarnated six times as
<>Bha1rgava Ra1ma. Incarnation of Buddha has taken
<>place in six Kaliyugas. Tripuradahana (burning of
<>the Tripura1suras) has taken place thirty times. Daks2a
<>ya1ga was broken up twice. Lord S4iva has slain ten
<>Indras. He fought seven times with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a for the
<>sake of Ba1n2a. I also remember another epic entitled [Page145-a+ 65]
<>“Ra1ma1yan2a”, containing one lakh of verses and dealing
<>with metaphysical problems. I have seen the customs
<>of Kr2tayuga being followed in Kaliyuga and the customs
<>of Kaliyuga being followed in Kr2tayuga.”
<NI>Having heard the whole story, Vasis2t2ha gave his blessing
<>to Bhus4un2d2a and left the place. (Jn5a1na Va1sis2t2ha,
<>Bhu un2d2opa1khya1na).
<HI>BHU1TADHA1MA1. An Indra. This Indra is different
<>from the actual Indra. There is reference to this Indra
<>in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 28.
<HI>BHU1TAJYOTI. A king who was the father of Vasu and
<>son of Sumati.
<HI>BHU1TAKARMA1. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Kauravas in the battle at Kuruks2etra. He was
<>killed by S4ata1ni1ka, the son of Nakula. (M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 25).
<HI>BHU1TA1LAYA(M). A famous village in the pura1n2as.
<>It was a resort of thieves and robbers. Dead bodies
<>were often thrown into the river which was flowing
<>through this village. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 129, verse 9 says that it was against S4a1stras to bathe
<>in this river.
<HI>BHU1TAMATHANA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.
<>B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 69).
<HI>BHU1TASANTA1PANA. One of the sons of Hiran2ya1ks2a.
<>(Bha1gavata, Saptama Skandha).
<HI>BHU1TAS4ARMA1. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Kauravas against the Pa1n2d2avas. He had taken his
<>position in the “Garud2avyu1ha” (name of a phalanx)
<>formed by Dron2a1ca1rya. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>20, Verse 6).
<HI>BHU1TAS. (A set of beings created by Rudra).
<NI>1) {%General.%} A Ma1nava class or sect in ancient India.
<>In the Pura1n2as, this Ma1nava sect is classified into four
<>subdivisions. (1) Dharmapraja (2) I1s4varapraja (3)
<>Ka1s4yapi1yapraja (4) Pulahapraja.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} In the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a there is the follow-
<>ing story about the birth and shape of Bhu1tas:--
<NI>Bhu1tas are one of the subdivisions of Pulaha's creations.
<>Long ago, Brahma1 asked the Rudra, Ni1lalohita, to
<>perform the function of creation. Accordingly he begot
<>thousands of Bhu1tas in the womb of his wife Sati1. All
<>the issues were the exact replica of his own figure.
<>Lean limbs, long ears, thick hanging lips, red eyes, bushy
<>eyebrows, long, pointed and protruding teeth, long nails,
<>matted dirty hair etc. were the grotesque features of
<>these Bhu1tas. These music-haters used serpents as their
<>Yajn5opavi1tas (sacred threads). These spirits who loitered
<>in S4iva's assembly were, as a rule, naked and carried
<>skulls on their heads. But at times they wore fantastic
<>dress with elephant skin. Their chief weapons were,
<>trident, bow, sword, etc.
<NI>3) {%Bhu1ta Chief.%} In the Pura1n2as, Rudra is acknowledged
<>as the Bhu1ta chief. That is why Rudra is known by such
<>names as “Bhu1tana1yaka”, “Gan2ana1yaka”, “Rudra1nu-
<>cara”, “Bhavaparis2ada” etc. But since the common
<>name Rudra is used for the ruler (king) of all the
<>Bhu1tas, Va1mana Pura1n2a declares that Rudra is not an
<>individual. Both Va1manapura1n2a and Matsyapura1n2a
<>represent Vi1rabhadra and Nandikes4vara as two Rudras
<>who are the masters of Bhu1tas. (Matsyapura1n2a 181,
<>2; Va1manapura1n2a 4, 17).
<NI>In Va1mana Pura1n2a, the number of Bhu1tas is given as
<>11 crores. S4kanda, Sa1kha, Bhairava are the chief among
<>them. Under them are innumerable Bhu1tas. Ashes [Page145-b+ 65]
<>and Khatva1m3ga etc. are their weapons. The emblem
<>on the banner is a cow or a bird. That is how the
<>Gan2ana1yakas have got the titles like “Mayu1radhvaja”,
<>“Mayu1rava1hana”. (Va1mana Pura1n2a 67, 1-23).
<NI>4) {%War with Asuras.%} In the war between S4iva and
<>Andhaka1sura, the Bhu1tas fought on the side of S4iva.
<>It was Vina1yaka, the master of the Bhu1ta hordes who
<>first came into conflict with the Asura. In that battle
<>Andhaka defeated Vina1yaka. After that, Nandi, an-
<>other leader of the Bhu1tas, attacked Andhaka jointly
<>with Vina1yaka and defeated him. At last, Andhaka
<>approached S4iva himself for protection, and S4iva received
<>him and appointed him as commander of one of his
<>hordes of Bhu1tas. It is this Andhaka1sura who later
<>became famous under the name of Bhr2n3gi.
<NI>In this way, the Bhu1tas had fought many battles with
<>the Asuras, joining the party of the Devas. But at the
<>time of Daks2a's yajn5a, they joined the party of the Asuras
<>and opposed the Devas.
<NI>Although the Bhu1tas won all the battles they fought both
<>on the side of the Devas and on the side of the Asuras,
<>in the end they had to leave north India and to come and
<>settle down in south India. By the time of Vaivasvata
<>manvantara they had already become South Indians.
<HI>BHU1TIVARMA1. A Ra1ks2asa who was the friend of
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti. (Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>BHUVANA I. A Mahar2s2i who visited Bhi1s2ma when he
<>was lying on the verge of death. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 26, Verse 81).
<HI>BHUVANA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. There is a
<>reference to him in M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 91,
<>Verse 35.).
<HI>BHUVANA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. There is a
<>reference to him in M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>91, Verse 35.).
<HI>BHUVANA1. Br2haspati's sister. She was married to
<>Prabha1sa, one of the As2t2avasus. A son named Vis4va-
<>karma1 was born to them. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, 3-3-21-
<>29).
<HI>BHUVANES4A. See the word Bhadras4ravas.
<HI>BI1BHATSU. One of the ten names of Arjuna. He got
<>this name because he desisted from doing loathful acts.
<>“I will never resort to loathful deeds in war. Therefore
<>the devas and men call me Bibhatsu”. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 44, Stanza 18).
<HI>BID2A1LA. A minister of Mahis2a1sura. (Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>BID2A1LOPA1KHYA1NA. See the word D2im3d2ika.
<HI>BID2AUJAS. A son born to Aditi by the blessings of
<>Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Bhu1mika1n2d2a, Chapter 3).
<HI>BILVA. (VILVA). A devotee of Vis2n2u. There is a
<>story in Skanda Pura1n2a about Bilva who lived as a
<>Vais2n2avite first and then was converted to a S4aivite.
<NI>In the beginning Brahma1 created many things among
<>which Vilva (tree) (Crataeva religiosa) also was
<>created. Under that tree an anonymous man began to
<>live. Brahma1 gave him the name Vilva. Being pleased
<>at the behaviour and devotion of Bilva, Indra asked him
<>to turn the wheel of administration of the earth. Accep-
<>ting the offer Bilva requested Indra to give him the
<>Vajra (diamond) for the smooth running of the adminis-
<>tration of the earth. Indra told him that vajra1yudha
<>(diamond-weapon) would be at his disposal, when he
<>thought about it, if the occasion required it.
<NI>Once Kapila a S4aivite reached the palace of Bilva.
<>After a long conversation both became fast friends. One [Page146-a+ 65]
<>day there was a debate between Bilva and Kapila as to
<>whether penance or Action (doing one's duty) was
<>appreciable. In this discussion Bilva lost the equilibrium
<>of his mind and thinking of the diamond-weapon of
<>Indra cut off the head of Kapila. In Kapila there was
<>the power of penance as well as the power of S4iva. So
<>through S4iva Kapila got immortality. In the meanwhile
<>Bilva went to Vis2n2u and got a boon that every living
<>thing in the earth should fear him. But the boon was
<>futile. This was a turning point for Bilva. The mind of
<>Bilva changed to devotion for S4iva. He concentrated his
<>attention on the worship of S4ivalin3ga at the forest of
<>Maha1ka1la. One day Kapila came by that way and was
<>greeted by Bilva with honour and regard, and they
<>again became fast friends.
<HI>BILVAKA. A famous serpent born to Kas4yapa praja1-
<>pati of his wife Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Stanza 12).

<>This serpent was burnt to death by falling in the sacrificial
<>fire of Janamejaya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 57,
<>Stanza 9).
<HI>BINDUGA. A Bra1hman2a who lived in the village of
<>Ba1s2kala. Being a frequenter of the houses of harlots
<>and of various other mean habits, he had led his wife
<>Can5cala1 also to lead an immoral life. Once Binduga
<>called his wife and told her thus: “You may continue
<>the life of a harlot; but all the money acquired must be
<>handed over to me.” Thus they continued their lives
<>and after their death both were reborn as devils in the
<>mountain of Vindhya. In the midst of their life as devils,
<>once it chanced for Can5cala1 to hear the S4iva Pura1n2a
<>recited and she got her shape of devil changed. She
<>requested Pa1rvati1 to change the shape of her husband
<>also. Pa1rvati1 sent her attendant Tumburu to Binduga
<>to tell him the story of S4iva and thus he also got his form
<>changed. (S4iva Pura1n2a Ma1ha1tmya).
<HI>BINDUMATI1. The queen of the great King Ma1ndha1ta1.
<>Bindumati1 was the daughter of the King S4as4abindu.
<>Purukutsa and Mucukunda were the two sons born to
<>her from Ma1ndha1ta1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).

<HI>BODHA1YANA. An individual of the lineage of teachers.
<>(See the word Guruparam3para1).
<HI>BODHISATTVA. A good-natured husband generally
<>quoted in Sanskrit works. The following is the story
<>given about him in Katha1saritsa1gara, Taran3ga 9.
<NI>Once there lived a wealthy Vais4ya, who had a son named
<>Bodhisattva. When the childhood of the boy was at an
<>end his mother died. The Vais4ya married again and got
<>his son also married. Because of the ear-buzzing of his
<>wife, the Vais4ya drove his son out of the house. Bodhi-
<>sattva left the house of his father, with his wife. By
<>and by they reached a desert. Not a drop of water was to
<>be had. There was not even the shoot of a grass. It was a
<>sandy place with nothing else in sight. He walked for
<>seven days carrying his wife on his shoulders. His wife
<>grew weary and worn with hunger and thirst. Seeing
<>that she was about to die he gave her his flesh and blood.
<>The wicked woman took them and saved herself from
<>death. On the eighth day they reached the jungles of a
<>hilly place full of fruit-trees and with a river with grassy
<>banks, flowing down to the valley. With fruits and cool
<>water he appeased the hunger and thirst of his wife.
<>Then he got down to the river to take a bath. He saw
<>a man with his limbs cut off, coming afloat. Now and
<>then he was producing pitiable sounds. The kind son of
<>the Vais4ya, without minding his weakness due to fast for
<>the last seven days, swam to the man and brought him to
<>the bank of the river. He did all services possible for him.
<>Then he asked him who had cut off his limbs. He rep-
<>lied that his enemies had done so, with the intention that
<>he might die suffering severe pain for a long time. The
<>Vais4ya's son stood still for a little while. Then he took
<>his bath. With his wife he lived in the forest doing
<>penance. The wounds of the man he saved had been
<>healed. The Vais4ya's son, one day, went out to the
<>forest to gather fruits and roots for their food. At that
<>time his wife grew lustful and had coition with the man
<>without limbs. Gradually she began to dote on him. She
<>decided to kill her husband who was an impediment on
<>her way. She pretended to be ill. The Vais4ya's son began
<>to treat her. One day she took her husband to the edge of
<>a very deep well and said: “See, there is a divine herb at
<>the bottom of this well. I will be cured if I could eat it.
<>This is what a goddess told me in a dream yesternight”.
<>Hearing this her husband made a rope, and tied it to a
<>tree. Then he began to go down the well by the rope.
<>She cut the rope and the man fell into the well. There
<>was a passage from the well to the river. The current
<>took him through that passage to the river. He got out of
<>the river, and sat under a tree thinking of the wickedness
<>of women. There was a city close by. At that time the
<>King of the city was dead and there was no heir left. The
<>subjects of the city brought an elephant and said, “whom
<>ever this elephant takes and places on his back shall be
<>our king”. They sent the elephant out. The elephant [Page147-a+ 64]
<>was pleased at the virtuous character of the son of the
<>Vais4ya. So taking him, as if he was God, placed him on
<>its back and walked to the city. The people gathered
<>round him and anointed him as their King. The son of
<>the Vais4ya became King. He never even thought of
<>women who are generally fickle and wicked.
<NI>The wicked wife of the Vais4ya's son took the limbless
<>man on her shoulder and wandered about saying, “The
<>enemies of my husband have put him in this plight.
<>Because of my conjugal fidelity I carry him thus and
<>earn our daily bread. Please give us alms”. In this
<>manner she spent her days in begging. Thus wandering
<>from place to place she reached the city where the
<>Vaisya's son was the King. The people, seeing her
<>loyalty to her husband, honoured her and spoke highly
<>of her. Hearing that a very loyal wife had reached his
<>city the King sent for her. The King recognized her
<>instantly. But she did not know him. The King reminded
<>her of her deeds of the past one by one and began to
<>tease and scold her. Finally when she understood that
<>the King was her husband she was dumb-founded. The
<>amazed ministers looked at each other. The King reveal-
<>ed everything to them. The ministers disfigured her and
<>drove her away.
<HI>BODHYA. A famous teacher-priest. Once there was a
<>discussion between Nahus2a and Bodhya on Philosophy.
<>The summary of what Bodhya said is as follows:--
<NI>Before I advise others, I do it myself first. I am the tea-
<>cher of none. I take the world as my teacher. I learned
<>the lessons of harmlessness from snakes, disappointment
<>from Pin3gala the harlot, self-sacrifice from animals,
<>concentration from the archer, and loneliness from a maid
<>who is a spinster. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, 171, 56, 61).
<NI>This hermit came to the King Yaya1ti and taught him
<>philosophy and ethics. The whole of the Chapter 171
<>of Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, comprises the exhortations
<>of this hermit, which are known by the famous name
<>Bodhya-Gi1ta1 (Song of Bodhya).
<HI>BRADHNA1S4VA. A king. Agastya once approached this
<>King to request him for some wealth. (See the word
<>Agastya).
<HI>BRAHMA1:
<NI>One of the trimu1rtis of the Hindu Pantheon. The tri-
<>mu1rtis are Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God who is the creator of the
<>Universe. It is mentioned in the Pura1n2as that Brahma1
<>creates, Vis2n2u preserves and Paramas4iva destroys the
<>universe.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Brahma1.%} The birth of Brahma1 is from
<>the nave of Vis2n2u. It is mentioned in Devi1 Pura1n2a,
<>Skandha 1, about the birth of Brahma1 as follows:--
<>In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u lay on a banian leaf in the
<>shape of a baby and began to think, “Who am I? Who
<>created me? What for? What is my work? Where to
<>work?” and so on. At that time an ethereal voice said:--
<>“Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham3 na1nyadasti sana1ta-
<>nam”.
<F>*) Idam3 sarvam3 khalu aham eva, Sana1tanam anyad na1sti. All these are myself. Except me there is nothing eternal.</F> Maha1vis2n2u was amazed at this ethereal
<>voice. He did not know whose oracle it was. Still He
<>lay meditating upon the words. Then Maha1devi1,
<>with four hands and weapons such as S4an3kha (conch),
<>Cakra (wheel), Gada1 (club), Padma (lotus) and
<>maids who are prosperities and having worn glorious
<>clothes and ornaments, and accompanied by the S4aktis [Page147-b+ 63]
<>(powers) named Rati, Bhu1ti, Buddhi, Mati, Ki1rti,
<>Dhr2ti, Smr2ti, S4raddha1, Medha1, Svadha1, Sva1ha1, Ks2udha1,
<>Nidra1, Daya1, Gati1, Tus2t2i, Pus2t2i, Ks2ama1, Lajja1, Jr2m3bha1
<>and Tandra1, appeared before Maha1vis2n2u, who was
<>struck with wonder. Maha1devi1 said, “Oh, Vis2n2u, what
<>is there to wonder at? Every time the universe is sub-
<>jected to creation, preservation and destruction, you
<>are born thus due to the great power of the supreme
<>spirit. It seems that you have forgotten those matters.
<>Know that the supreme power is beyond qualities. We
<>are all with qualities. Your main quality is Sattva.
<>From your nave Brahma1 will be born. His attribute is
<>Rajogun2a (activity, passion or motion). From the middle
<>of the eyebrows of Brahma1, will be born Rudra, whose
<>attribute will be Ta1masagun2a (darkness). Brahma1,
<>with the power of penance, will acquire the ability of
<>creation and by his attribute of Rajogun2a will create
<>the world in the colour of blood. You will be the preserver
<>of that world. The same world will be destroyed by
<>Rudra at the end of the Kalpa (world age)”.
<NI>Accordingly from the nave of Vis2n2u a lotus grew up and
<>in that lotus flower Brahma1 took his form. The same
<>Brahmadeva did penance before Maha1vis2n2u and Jaga-
<>damba1, who were pleased at his penance and gave him
<>all the boons he wanted. After that Brahma1 began the
<>work of creation. He created with his mind the Saptars2is,
<>(seven sages) and then the Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). From them all the movables and the
<>immovables in the universe came into existence. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>In manusmr2ti, Chapter 1, the following stanza about the
<>creation of Brahma1 occurs.
<Poem>“Tadan2d2amabhavad haimam
<>Sahasra1m3s4usamaprabham3 /
<>Tasmin jajn5e svayam3 Brahma1
<>Sarvalokapita1mahah2” //</Poem>
<NI>That egg was as radiant as the Sun, with the colour of
<>gold. Brahma1 the great grandfather of everything in the
<>world took birth by himself in it.
<NI>From the supreme power, an egg fell on the water which
<>was the first creation. That egg became a germ of golden
<>colour. Creating a life, which had done penance in its
<>former births in such a way as to enable it to become
<>Brahma1, in the golden germ of the egg, the supreme power
<>entered the life that is to become Brahma1 as its inner
<>guide. That Brahma1 is known as the Pita1maha (Grand-
<>father of the manes) or Paternal grandfather of all the
<>worlds.”
<NI>Va1manapura1n2a Chapter 43 states as follows about the
<>creation of Brahma1:--
<NI>Ages before the beginning, when all the worlds with
<>everything they contained were submerged in the single
<>ocean of the great flood, the germ of living things formed
<>itself into a big egg. Brahma1 who had been inside the
<>egg went to a long sleep. The sleep continued for a
<>thousand yugas (ages) when Brahma1 woke up; as
<>Sattva gun2a (purity) was the foremost attribute of him,
<>he saw that the world was void. When the thought of
<>creation occurred in his mind Rajogun2a (activity or
<>passion) became his foremost attribute. Rajas is the
<>attribute that creates and Sattva, that which preserves.
<>At the time of destruction Tamogun2a (darkness) be-
<>comes the foremost attribute. That Bhagava1n (Supreme [Page148-a+ 64]
<>Spirit) the Purus2a (the Male creative Energy) pervades
<>over everything, in all the living worlds. That Eternal
<>Being is Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva.
<NI>Knowing that the world was lying in pure water, the
<>Bhagava1n (Supreme Being) cut the egg open. From it the
<>Om3ka1ra (the sacred syllable ‘Om’) emanated. The
<>first sound of it was ‘Bhu1h2’, the second, sound, ‘Bhuvah2’
<>and the third sound ‘Svah2’. So they came to be known
<>as “Bhu1rbhuvah2 Svah2”. Then the glorious radiance of
<>the sun was born from it and Brahma1 the grandfather of
<>the worlds originated in the centre of the egg.
<NI>3) {%Instigation to compose Ra1ma1yan2a.%} It was Brahma1 who
<>instigated Va1lmi1ki to compose the Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>A fowler of the forest tribe shot down one of a couple of
<>snipes which were carrying on love-making, on the banks
<>of the River Tamasa1. Seeing this Va1lmi1ki cursed the
<>fowler. The curse came out of the mouth of Va1lmi1ki
<>in the form of a verse,
<F>1) You forester, your life will not continue for many years since you have killed one of the couple of snipes.</F> “ma1 nis2a1da pratis2t2ha1m tvama-
<>gamah2 s4a1s4vati1h2 sama1h2, yat kraun5camithuna1dekam,
<>avadhi1h2 ka1mamohitam,” which according to hearsay,
<>is the first piece of poetry in the world. Brahma1 who
<>was attracted by the poetry came to the hermitage of
<>Va1lmi1ki and instigated him to compose the story of
<>Ra1ma in verse. It is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 2, that the Ra1ma1yan2a was composed
<>thus.
<NI>4) {%Ra1van2a is given a boon.%} It was Brahma1 who made
<>Ra1van2a an ever-powerful hero. Penance was done by
<>Ra1van2a in the vicinity of the Hima1layas and Brahma1
<>appeared before him and granted him the boon that no
<>living creature except man, would kill him. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 16).
<NI>5) {%The loss of a head.%} Long ago S4iva plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. This story occurs in various pura1n2as with
<>slight changes. Two of them are given below:--
<NI>(1) In olden days, in the period of Satyayuga, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u did penance in S4vetadvi1pa (the island S4veta)
<>to obtain Eternal Bliss, being deeply engaged in the study
<>of Brahmavidya1. Brahma1 also went to another place
<>and began to do penance for the suppression of passions.
<>Both were doing severe penance. So they began to
<>walk in order to take rest from the penance. On the way
<>they met each other. One asked “who are you?” The
<>other also asked the same question. The talk ended in a
<>contest as to who was the greater of the two. Each
<>claimed himself to be the supreme power of the world.
<>Neither of them was prepared to recognize the claims
<>of the other. In the midst of this contest, a phallus,
<>extra-ordinarily bulky and fair appeared before them and
<>an ethereal voice said from the sky: “You need not
<>quarrel as to who is superior. He who reaches the extre-
<>mity of this phallus is the superior person. So both of
<>you proceed, one upwards and the other downwards
<>and find out the end.” Hearing this Vis2n2u went down-
<>wards to find out the bottom and Brahma1, upwards to
<>the top. Vis2n2u travelled for a long time and finding no
<>end thought the attempt futile and returned to the start-
<>ing point with disappointment and sat down.
<NI>Brahma1 travelled upwards for a long time and found no
<>end. On the way he saw the petal of a pan2d2a1nus flower,
<>coming down from the sky. Brahma1 took it and joyfully
<>returned and said haughtily to Vis2n2u: “See, I have
<>taken this flower from the head of the Phallus. I have [Page148-b+ 63]
<>brought this to convince you. You have been defeated.
<>So can you not admit that I am the superior?”
<>Maha1vis2n2u did not believe the words of Brahma1. So he
<>called the Pan2d2a1nus flower to him and questioned it.
<>The Pan2d2a1nus flower took false oath and witnessed in
<>favour of Brahma1, who had asked the flower before-
<>hand to be on his side. Maha1vis2n2u did not believe
<>this either and said, “Let S4iva be witness to this flower”.
<>S4iva at these words appeared before them and revealed
<>the deceit played by Brahma1 and the flower and then
<>cursed the Pan2d2a1nus flower that thenceforward it
<>should not have a place among the flowers of oblation
<>to S4iva. Then S4iva got angry and plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. That is the skull S4iva uses for receiving
<>alms. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, S4kandha 5.)
<NI>(2) In days of old all the worlds with everything in them
<>were under water in a single ocean. The Sun, the
<>Moon, the Stars, air, fire, everything was destroyed. A
<>day of utter darkness appeared. Grass, bush all were
<>destroyed. Nothing could be seen and recognized. All
<>existents and non-existents were destroyed. Bhagava1n,
<>(Supreme Being) was sleeping continuously for so many
<>thousands of nights. At the end of the night Bhagava1n
<>assumed the attribute of Rajas (Activity) and got ready
<>for the work of creation. He, the knower of all Vedas
<>and Veda1n3gas appeared in the shape of a wonderful be-
<>ing with five faces. Another being with three eyes, matted
<>hair, a trident in one hand, and a garland of beads in the
<>other, and with darkness as its attribute took shape. That
<>being was called Purus2a (the male creative energy).
<>Then the Maha1tma1 (the Supreme Spirit) created Aham3-
<>ka1ra (Egoism). It affected Brahma1 and S4iva. Overcome
<>by egoism, S4iva said to Brahma1:--“Who are you? Who
<>created you?” Swelled with egoism Brahma1 asked in
<>reply:--“Who are you? Who are your parents? Let
<>me hear it.” This talk ended in a quarrel. The origin of
<>Bhagava1n (the Lord) was from this quarrel. Immedi-
<>ately after his birth the Lord took an unparralleled lute
<>and playing it, went up to the sky. S4iva being defeated
<>by Brahma1, bowed his head and coloured. While Para-
<>mes4vara was standing angrily thus, the fifth face told
<>him, “You, who are having three eyes and whose attri-
<>bute is darkness! look here! I will tell you all. You, who
<>wear air as garments, and ride on an ox, are the destroyer
<>of the world.” Hearing these words S4iva grew more and
<>more angry, opened his third eye and looked steadily
<>at Brahma1 to burn him. Seeing the faces shining like the
<>Sun Brahma1 said, “When you beat on water, bubbles will
<>appear. But do they have any prowess? Hearing this,
<>S4iva plucked off the head of Brahma1 with the tip of his
<>finger nails. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>5) {%Changing Vijayalaks2mi1 to Lan3ka1laks2mi1, by curse.%} Vijaya-
<>laks2mi1, one of the eight Laks2mi1s, was the treasury-
<>keeper of Brahma1. Once she became careless in dis-
<>charging her duties. Brahma1 got angry and cursed her.
<>“You go to Ra1van2a and keep his tower”. She humbly
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Brahma1 said,
<>“At the time of the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma, a monkey-
<>hero named Hanuma1n will reach Lan3ka1 in search of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma's wife, whom Ra1van2a had kidnapped. You will
<>obstruct him, and he will strike you down. On that day
<>you will be absolved from the curse and you will return
<>here instantly.” Accordingly Vijayalaks2mi1 was born in [Page149-a+ 64]
<>Lan3ka1 under the name Lan3ka1laks2mi1. When Hanuma1n
<>jumped to Lan3ka1 she prevented him, and he struck her
<>down to the ground. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Brahma1 cursing the daughters of Himava1n.%} Three dau-
<>ghters named Kut2ila1, Ra1gin2i1 and Pa1rvati1 and a son
<>named Suna1bha were born to Himava1n by his wife
<>Mena1. The three daughters went to the Hima1layas for
<>penance, to get S4iva as husband. They were not even
<>six years old then. The devas saw them. The A1dityas
<>and the Vasus took Kut2ila1 who was doing penance, to
<>the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together
<>and asked Brahma1. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if
<>this girl will be able to bear a son who could kill Mahis2a1-
<>sura”. Brahma1 replied. “This poor girl will not be
<>capable of bearing the radiance of S4iva. So let her go
<>away.” Kut2ila1 got angry at Brahma1 and said “Lord,
<>I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of
<>S4iva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please
<>Vis2n2u and make S4iva bow his head. I take a vow to
<>that effect.” Brahma1 became angry and told Kut2ila1,
<>“You, wicked Kut2ila1, you did not succumb to my words.
<>So by my curse you will be turned to water.”
<NI>Kut2ila1 having been cursed by Brahma1 became water
<>and began to flood the world of Brahma1. Seeing the flow
<>of water, Brahma1 made cause-ways on four sides with the
<>Vedas of R2g, Yajus, Sa1ma and Atharva. Thus being
<>tied up she stays in the world of Brahma1.
<NI>The Devas took Ra1gin2i1 also before Brahma1 and put the
<>same question. The reply of Brahma1 was the same as
<>before. She also got angry and said to Brahma1. “I will
<>do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in
<>my family to be the killer of Mahis2a1sura.” Brahma1
<>cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my
<>words which even devas won't gainsay. So you will be-
<>come the colours of the twilight.” Thus she became the
<>fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divid-
<>ed among the Pleiades. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>51).
<NI>7) {%Giving a boon to a tiger and golden colour to Pa1rvati1.%} The
<>first name of Pa1rvati1, the daughter of Himava1n was Ka1li1.
<>She was given this name (Ka1li1) because of her dark
<>complexion. After the marriage S4iva and Pa1rvati1 led a
<>household life in the golden house built by Vis4vakarma1.
<>Once S4iva called Devi1 humorously, by the name Ka1li1.
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and said to her husband. “A wound by
<>an arrow will be cured. If you cut down a tree by an
<>axe it will sprout again. A wound inflicted by hard
<>words will never be cured. The arrows of words shoot
<>out of the mouth. Those who are hit by them suffer
<>pain day and night. Wise people should not shoot them
<>at others. You have violated that principle. So my lord,
<>I am going to do intensive penance. I will endeavour to
<>create such a condition, that you may not call me by the
<>name Ka1li1 again.” Saying thus, Pa1rvati1 bowed before
<>Parames4vara and bidding good-bye she went up into the
<>air and reached the peak of Hima1layas and thought of
<>Jaya1, Vijaya1, Jayanti1 and Apara1jita1. Instantly they
<>arrived to see Ka1li1. They got permission and stayed with
<>Pa1rvati1 to attend on her.
<NI>While Pa1rvati1 was engaged in doing penance, a tiger,
<>with his weapons of tusks and claws came there from the
<>jungles of the Hima1layas. Uma1 (Pa1rvati1) was standing
<>on one leg. The tiger began to think, “I shall do it when [Page149-b+ 65]
<>it is needed”. Thinking thus it gazed at the face of Devi1
<>with staring eyes and consequently it lost one eye.
<NI>Pronouncing the word Brahma1 Devi1 did penance for a
<>hundred years. After that Brahma1, the Lord of the three
<>worlds appeared before her and said to her: “I am much
<>pleased. Your penance was flawless. Ask your boon.”
<>Ka1li1 replied, “Oh, Lotus-born! First give this tiger a
<>boon. It will please me.” Then Brahma1 gave the wonder-
<>ful tiger leadership of the Gan2as, devotion to S4iva, invin-
<>cibility and righteousness. After giving the tiger this boon
<>Brahma1 told Pa1rvati1, “Now, Ambika1, ask your boon.
<>Don't hesitate, I will grant the boon.” Then Pa1rvati1
<>asked the boon. “Brahma1, give me golden colour”.
<>Brahma1 said “Let it be so”, and disappeared. The
<>dark complexion of Pa1rvati1 disappeared. She got the
<>colour of the filament of the lotus flower. From the dis-
<>carded skin Ka1tya1yani1 was born. Then Indra appeared
<>and asked for her as a gift. Indra requested Pa1rvati1 on
<>behalf of heaven. “Let me have her. Let this Kaus4iki1
<>be my sister. Because she was born from your Kos4a,
<>(outer skin) she is Kaus4iki1, I am also Kaus4ika.” Devi1
<>gave the beautiful Kaus4iki1 to Indra. Sahasra1ks2a (Indra
<>who has thousand eyes) took her to the Vindhya moun-
<>tain; when they reached there Indra told her. “You stay
<>on this mount, honoured and revered by gods. You will
<>be known as Vindhyava1sini1 (who stays on the Vindhya).
<>He consecrated the goddess there. She was given a lion
<>as her carrier (Va1hana) “You destroy the asuras?”
<>saying so Indra returned to Heaven. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 54).
<NI>8) {%Brahma1 became river.%} Long ago in the period of
<>Ca1ks2us2a manvantara (the age of a Manu), Brahma1
<>decided to perform a sacrifice on the Sahya Mountain
<>and preparations were made for it. Brahma1 came with
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva. Bhr2gu and the other hermits took their
<>seats. Maha1vis2n2u called Svara1devi1, the wife of Brahma1.
<>But she was very slow in coming. The hermit Bhr2gu
<>said to Vis2n2u: “You yourself have gone to call Devi1.
<>But she is very slow. The auspicious moment is coming
<>to an end. So how are we to commence the rituals?”
<>“If Svara1 does not appear before the end of the stipulated
<>time we shall seat Ga1yatri1 in her place,” said Vis2n2u.
<>S4iva also agreed to it. So Bhr2gu seated Ga1yatri1 on the
<>right side of Brahma1 and the rituals were performed. By
<>then Svara1 reached the sacrificial hall. When she saw
<>that Ga1yatri was placed in her place and the rituals were
<>performed she became angry, because of her quarrel
<>with her co-wife. She called out: “Where the person to
<>whom respect is due, is not given respect and where the
<>person who ought not to be respected is given undue
<>respect, there, scarcity, death and fear will be rampant.
<>She dared to sit on the right in my place. So she will
<>grow lean and become a river which will not be seen in
<>the world. All of you will become rivers because you have
<>placed a person lower than me in my position.” Hearing
<>the curse of Svara1, Ga1yatri1 rose up trembling, and cursed
<>Svara1 also to become a river. Before Svara1 was changed
<>to a river, Brahma1 and the other gods rose up and
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Svara1 said,
<>“Gods, it is because you have not given oblations to
<>Gan2apati in the beginning of the sacrifice, that this
<>break, due to my anger, has been caused. My curse
<>cannot be futile. So each of you change to a river by
<>your portions and we, your wives, will also become rivers
<>by our portions, and flow to the west.” [Page150-a+ 65]
<NI>Thus Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara became rivers
<>with their portions. Brahma1 became the fast-flowing
<>Kukudmati1, Maha1vis2n2u changed to river Kr2s2n2a1 and
<>S4iva, the river Ven2i1. The devas also changed their
<>portions to rivers and flowed from the Sahya mountain
<>to the east and their wives changed to rivers by their
<>portions and flowed to the west. Svara1 and Ga1yatri1
<>flowed as two rivers to the west and then joined together
<>as one river called Sa1vitri1. Vis2n2u and S4iva who were
<>consecrated at the sacrifice by Brahma1 came to be called
<>Bala and Atibala (Powerful and more powerful). This is
<>the origin of the rivers in Kerala. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 113).
<NI>9) {%Brahma1 is not worshipped.%} Long ago Brahma1 and
<>Vis2n2u went to see S4iva near Himava1n. They saw a shin-
<>ing phallus there in front of them. It was of immense
<>size. One of them went downwards and the other
<>upwards to find out the end of it. Both returned without
<>reaching the top or the bottom and by penance they
<>pleased S4iva who appeared before them and asked them
<>what boon they desired. Brahma1 asked S4iva to take
<>birth as his son. S4iva did not like this and said that no-
<>body would worship Brahma1 because of his extravagant
<>desire (namely, to have S4iva as his son). Vis2n2u requested
<>that he should be made a servant at S4iva's feet. So
<>Vis2n2u incarnated as S4iva's S4akti (power). That S4akti is
<>Pa1rvati1. So Vis2n2u and Pa1rvati1 are one and the same in a
<>sense. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2halambakam3, Ta-
<>ran3ga 1).
<NI>10) {%The abode of Brahma1.%} It is said in Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 8, that the abode of Brahma1 is on the top of
<>Mount Maha1meru. There are nine towns there. Mano-
<>vati1 which is in the centre, is the town of Brahma1. Due
<>east of Manovati1 stands Amara1vati1, the town of Indra.
<>On the south-east corner there is Rajovati1 which is owned
<>by Agni (fire-god). Due south of Brahmapuri1 there is
<>the town of Sam3yamani1 which is the town of Yama (God
<>of death) On the south west corner there is the town of
<>Nirr2ti. It is named Kr2s2n2a1n5jana1. On the west there is
<>the town called S4raddha1vati1. It is the abode of God
<>Varun2a. On the north-west corner there is the town
<>called Gandhavati1 which is the abode of Bhagava1n
<>Va1yu (Wind-God). Due north to Brahmapuri1 stands the
<>town of Kubera (God of wealth). It is known by the
<>name Mahodaya. On the north east corner there is the
<>city of S4iva. It is known as Yas4ovati1.
<NI>11) {%The sons of Brahma1.%} Brahma1 is the creator of all
<>the living things in the world. Still mention is made in the
<>Pura1n2as about countless divine persons who were born
<>from the mind and body of Brahma1, directly and indi-
<>rectly. They are given below in groups.
<NI>(1) Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
<>It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 10, that these six grand hermits were born
<>from the mind of Brahma1.
<NI>(2) Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 51 that these
<>two were good sons born to Brahma1.
<NI>(3) Rudra. Mention is made in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>20, that Brahma1 had a roaring son who was named
<>Rudra.
<NI>(4) Sva1yam3bhuva Manu. It occurs in Bha1gavata
<>Skandha 11, that Manu Sva1yam3bhuva was the son of
<>Brahma1.
<NI>(5) Kandarpa (Ka1madeva--Cupid). In Katha1sarit- [Page150-b+ 64]
<>sa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3baka, Taran3ga, 6, it is mentioned
<>that Cupid was born from the Egoism of Brahma1.
<NI>(6) Madhuka and Golika1. In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a, men-
<>tion is made that from the playful habit of Brahma1, a
<>giant named Madhuka and a giantess named Golika1
<>were born.
<NI>(7) Bhr2gu. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanza 8, that the hermit Bhr2gu was the son
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>(8) Ja1m3bava1n. It is seen in Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a that
<>Ja1m3bava1n was born from the sweat of Brahma1.
<NI>(9) The Sanakas. In Bha1gavata mention is made that
<>the Sanakas (Sanaka, Sananda, Sana1tana and Sanat-
<>kuma1ra) were sons of Brahma1.
<NI>(10) In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva there is a
<>passage given as the words of Vasis2t2ha spoken to Bhr2gu,
<>about the birth of many of the sons of Brahma1. “May
<>I tell you a story I have heard long ago about the revela-
<>tion of Brahma1 of himself?
<NI>Lord Rudra took the form of Varun2a and performed a
<>sacrifice. Many hermits, all the devas, Agni and others,
<>Vas2at2k ra (Exclamation in sacrifice) which took body,
<>and all yajn5a1n3gas came to the sacrificial hall. All the
<>expedients, all the glories which are thousands in number
<>took shape and came to the sacrifice. R2gveda arrayed
<>in garments of heroism came there. All the omens, all
<>the voices, all the emotions, all the etymologies of pro-
<>nouncing Veda Su1ktas, all the svarabhaktikas, Om3ka1ra
<>(the syllable Om3) the eye of all the Vedic metres and
<>their theories, all restraints and donations, all Vedas,
<>Upanis2ads, accomplishments, Sa1vitri1, the past, the near
<>future and distant future, all these came there. The
<>Lord S4iva held everyone of them. He offered his spirit
<>by his spirit. The sacrifice took many forms and shed
<>radiances. Paramas4iva is heaven, is the sky, is the earth,
<>is the ether and the husband of the Earth, is the lord
<>of all accomplishments, is noble and the lord of radiance.
<>This Lord is lauded by the names Brahma1, S4iva, Rudra,
<>Varun2a, Agni, and Prabha1vati1. S4iva is the King of all
<>the worlds. Penances, sacrifices, vows emblazed by fast,
<>all the directions and gods of directions, Indras, celestial
<>maids, mothers of the worlds, all these assumed forms
<>and came to the sacrifice in multitudes. Everybody who
<>witnessed the sacrifice of Parames4vara, who was in the
<>form of Varun2a, was greatly pleased. Seeing the pleased
<>celestial maids standing in rows passion arose in Brahma1.
<>He had seminal discharge. A1ditya (the Sun) took the
<>earth on which the semen fell and threw it into the sacri-
<>ficial fire, which blazed furiously. Brahma1 who became
<>the offerer of oblation had discharge again. He got it in
<>the sacrificial ladle and with recitation of spells offered
<>it in the sacrificial fire as if it was ghee. The powerful
<>semen contained the three attributes of Sattva, Rajas
<>and Tamas. From the attribute of Rajas arose the
<>living world which had activity as its purpose. Radiance
<>is the quality of Sattva which entered the living and non-
<>living world. It gives light to everything. It also gives
<>the power of discrimination. From the semen offered
<>in the fire, three sons with body and the attributes of
<>demi-gods came out. The male who had originated from
<>the flame called ‘Bharjana’ became An3giras. The male
<>who originated from the burning coals became Kavi.
<>Over and above these three radiances, other radiances
<>also originated from the sacrificial fire. From the Mari1cis [Page151-a+ 65]
<>(rays) of the fire Mari1ci the father of Kas4yapa was born.
<>From the Kus4a-grass spread on the floor of the hall of
<>sacrifice, the Ba1lakhilyas were born. Atri also was
<>born from the Kus4a-grass. The noble hermits called
<>Vaikha1nasas, who have grown powerful by penance and
<>became the seat of all good qualities, were born from
<>the sacrificial ashes. From the stream of fire which are
<>the eyes of the sacrificial fire the handsome As4vins
<>were born. The rest of the Praja1patis were born from
<>the ears of the fire. From the pores of the skin of fire
<>were born the hermits, from the sweat the ‘chandas’
<>(metre of Vedas) and from might, the mind. For this
<>reason the Vedic scholars and knowers of the S4ruti and
<>those who see the superiority of Vedas, say that fire is a
<>combination of all the gods. The trees that feed the fire
<>are called Ma1sas (months), the sap of the tree is called
<>Paks2a (half of the month i.e. full moon to new moon and
<>new moon to full moon), the pith of the tree is called
<>night and day and the flames are called Muhu1rtas
<>(auspicious moments). Rudras were born from the
<>blood of fire and the golden coloured gods, the Maitras,
<>also were born from the blood of fire. From the smoke
<>of the fire, the Vasus, from the flame of the fire Rudras
<>and the A1dityas of the extreme radiance were born.
<>The planets and stars which stand in their places in
<>the sky are the charcoal of the fire. Brahma1 declared that
<>fire was Brahma1 the supreme spirit, eternal and the
<>giver of all wishes. The sinless Maha1deva, who was in
<>the form of Varun2a said, “This sacrificial fire is mine,
<>and I am the sacrificer. So the children born as the first
<>fruit of this sacrifice are mine. So Bhr2gu, An3giras and
<>Kavi are my sons, no doubt. Let everybody who moves
<>along the sky know that these three are my sons, the
<>fruit of my sacrifice.” Agni said, “These are born from
<>my organs. They had been depending on me for their
<>sustenance. So they are my sons.” Brahma1 the teacher
<>of all the worlds and the grandfather of all living beings
<>said, “They are my sons. I offered my sperm to the fire,
<>and these sons were born therefrom, How can they be
<>claimed by anybody else? Here, I am the utterer of the
<>spell and the offerer of the sperm. I am the owner of
<>the sperm. Am I not the owner of the fruit? There is no
<>contest on the point that the birth of Bhr2gu and others is
<>from the oblation of my sperm.” The Gods who heard
<>these arguments bowed their heads before Brahma1 and
<>greeting him said, “Lord Brahma1, It is not only us that
<>are born from you, but the entire world of living and
<>non-living is born from you. So let Agni and Deva in
<>the shape of Varun2a have their wishes.”
<NI>12) {%Brahma1 and the giantess Karkkat2i1.%} In days of old, a
<>ferocious giantess named Karkkat2i1 lived on the northern
<>side of the Hima1layas. Because of the hugeness of her
<>body and the scarcity of food she became famished. She
<>began to do penance for the alleviation of her hunger
<>and thirst. She stood on one leg in the Hima1laya Moun-
<>tain, fixing her eyes on the sun in the day and on the
<>Moon in the night, and the severe penance continued
<>for a thousand years. Then Brahma1 appeared before her
<>and told her that she could ask for any boon. She said
<>“I wish to become a Su1ci1 (Needle) as hard as iron, hav-
<>ing the form of disease. This is the boon I pray for,
<>Brahma1”. Brahma1 blessed her and said, “Let it be so,
<>my daughter, you shall be a su1cika1 (needle) with the
<>prefix ‘V’ that is Vis4u1cika1 (Spasmodic cholera) You
<>can eat those who eat stale food, those who are wicked, [Page151-b+ 65]
<>those who sit in places where they ought not to sit and
<>those who are hard-hearted. Enter into their bodies and
<>affect their hearts, spleens and life-breaths. Thus carry
<>out the work of destruction? You can affect both the
<>good and the bad. But good people should not be killed.
<>So to save them from death, you can use this mantra
<>(spell).
<NI>“om3, hra1m3, hri1m3, s4ri1m3, s4a1m3, vis2n2us4aktaye, namah2;
<>bhagavati vis2n2us4akti ehi, ena1m3 hara hara: dehe hana
<>hana? paca paca! matha matha: utsa1daya utsa1-
<>daya: du1re kuru kuru sva1ha1--vis2u1cike! tvam3 hima-
<>vantam3 gaccha? ji1vasarah2 candraman2d2alam3 gata1si
<>sva1ha1.”
<NI>Saying these words Brahma1 disappeared. Karkkat2i1 made
<>her body smaller and smaller and finally assumed the
<>shape of a needle. After that she began her work by
<>entering the body of those who had lost their energy
<>because of illness, in the form of a needle of gout and
<>caused Cholera, and the body of those who were lean
<>and worn and weary, in the form of internal cholera.
<>Thus assuming two bodies and killing countless people
<>she travelled for a long time in the earth and the sky,
<>until she herself felt aversion to her work. When she
<>remembered her original form she loathed the needle-
<>form. Karkkat2i1 again went to the vicinity of the Hima1-
<>layas and began to do penance, which lasted for another
<>thousand years. Thus she became pure and by the
<>power of thinking, she acquired spiritual knowledge.
<>Then she wanted to be saved from the mirage of birth
<>and death, to attain which, she did penance for yet
<>another thousand years at the end of which, the highly
<>pleased Brahma1 appeared before her and said, “daugh-
<>ter Karkkat2i1, all the darkness is erased from your heart
<>and you have attained deliverance from delusion. Now
<>I will bless you according to your wish. Receive your
<>original body and walk about in the worlds eating the
<>ignorant, bad beginners, the imprudent, those who sit in
<>bad places and dwell in bad places.”
<NI>She became a giantess again, but as she had attained
<>purity of soul, she engaged herself in deep meditation
<>which was free from doubt. The meditation lasted for a
<>long time. Finally her mind waved. Then she remem-
<>bered about worldly things and felt hunger. She remem-
<>bered, “Brahma1 has ordained the wicked as my food.
<>So I shall seek them.” Thinking thus she went to a jungle
<>in the vicinity of the Hima1layas. That was the dwelling
<>place of foresters. In that dark night the King and the
<>minister of the foresters approached the place where
<>Karkkat2i1 sat. Karkkat2i1 seeing them thought, “let me
<>know first if they are good or bad.” So she decided to
<>ask them some questions.
<NI>She asked them in a voice like thunder. “Who are you?
<>Are you enlightened sages or ignorant fools? say quickly.”
<>The king of the foresters hearing this replied in a cynical
<>way. “You insignificant ghost? What is your form?
<>Where do you sit? Let us see your powerless body. Who
<>is there to fear at your sound which is like the humming
<>of a she-beetle?”
<NI>Hearing this reply Karkkat2i1 showed her tusks and lau-
<>ghed loud, to spread light, and to terrify them. They
<>heard the loud roaring sound of her laugh and saw her
<>huge form in the light. But those mighty heroes were
<>not at all shaken by the sound they heard or the sight
<>they witnessed. The Minister looked at her and said,
<>“Hei, Giantess? These delusions of yours will have no [Page152-a+ 65]
<>effect on us. Even if a number of mosquitoes like you
<>come before us, they will be only dry leaves before wind.
<>You are acting like this merely for food. So what is
<>your need? Tell us, we will satisfy you”.
<NI>Hearing the words of the minister Karkkat2i1 knew that
<>her might was useless before such valiant men. She
<>thought them to be sages. So she said “Hey mighty
<>heroes. Who are you? Tell me the truth”. The minister
<>said: “This the King of foresters and I am his minister.
<>We came for a night-walk to find out and punish wicked
<>people like you.”
<NI>The giantess appreciated them and said: “I am about to
<>put some questions to you. If you give me suitable ans-
<>wers you will be saved.” The King agreed. The ques-
<>tions put by her are given below in the order they were
<>asked:--
<NI>1) Inside what atom which is unit and multiple at the
<>same time, do the lakhs of universes originate and vanish
<>as bubbles in a sea?
<NI>2) What does shine as ether and non-ether?
<NI>3) What is it that is something and nothing?
<NI>4) What is it that is going and not going at the same
<>time?
<NI>5) What is it that has taken form from voidness?
<NI>6) What is it that is moving and at the same time station-
<>ary as a rock?
<NI>7) Who draws pictures in clear sky?
<NI>8) In what seed do the worlds exist as a big tree in its
<>seed?
<NI>9) From what substance can the living and non-living
<>things in the worlds, not be separated as the foam and
<>waves cannot be separated from the ocean?
<NI>10) What substance is dualism not separate from
<>(others) as fluidity from water?
<NI>The reply given by the minister to each question is given
<>below in the order of the questions.
<NI>1) Hey, Giantess: All the questions you have put be-
<>fore us encased in figurative words discernible only to
<>the Vedic sages, are concerned with the supreme Being.
<>The atom is the supreme Spirit which is beyond all
<>knowledge of the mind and the senses. As it is without
<>organs of action it is as unmanifested as the sky. And
<>inside that supreme atom which could be felt only by the
<>mind, crores and crores of bubbles of universes originate
<>and vanish due to frailty.
<NI>2) The impersonal Supreme Being, having no substance,
<>pervades everything. This Supreme Being, Brahman,
<>is pure knowledge (Jn5a1nasvaru1pa). It is the sky and the
<>non-sky.
<NI>3) As it is indescribable the Impersonal Supreme Spirit
<>is nothing, but as it is a reality it is something.
<NI>4) As it pervades everything accessible, the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit has the quality of motion. But as it has
<>no emotions and as there exists no space beyond, it is
<>motionless.
<NI>5) As it is inaccessible to others the Supreme Spirit is
<>having no existence, but as it is the essence of everything
<>that is good, it has existence.
<NI>6) The Supreme Spirit is the radiance of motion or
<>activity and as there is nothing else to be found out, that
<>is, as it doesn't know anything else it is as rigid as a
<>rock.
<NI>7) In the clear sky the Supreme Spirit draws the pictures
<>of the universe.
<NI>8) Exists in the Supreme Atom. [Page152-b+ 65]
<NI>9) As the entire visible world cannot be separated from
<>the Supreme Spirit nothing is other than the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit.
<NI>10) The differentiations of the various worlds are mere
<>appearances of the Supreme Spirit and so dualism is of the
<>same figure.
<NI>The King drew Karkkat2i1 nearer to the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit. He advised her not to commit slaughter.
<>She accepted the advice. The King asked her to come
<>to his palace assuming the form of a beautiful woman.
<>She asked, what could he offer to a giantess as food.
<>The King said: “You good woman, we shall find out a
<>way for that. You change yourself to a beautiful woman
<>wearing golden ornaments and stay in my palace for a
<>while. I shall arrange to gather sinners, robbers and
<>such other wicked people who are to be given capital
<>punishment, in thousands from various places, and shall
<>give them to you. You can take your original form and
<>take them all to the peaks of the Himalaya and feed on
<>them.
<NI>Gluttonous people like to eat in solitude. After having
<>eaten sumptuously, take some sleep, and a little rest in
<>meditation. When you wake up you come again and
<>take away people destined to be killed. The slaughter
<>done for the sake of righteousness is not a sin. It is said
<>to be equal to mercy. When your desire for meditation
<>is over you must come to me. If an attachment of love
<>is formed even with bad persons it is difficult to break
<>the love.”
<NI>Karkkat2i1 obeyed the King. They all reached the palace.
<>Within six days three thousand wicked persons, who
<>were sentenced to death, were brought before the King,
<>from his own country and the various dependent coun-
<>tries, and were given to Karkkat2i1. In the night she took
<>her original form, gathered all the wicked people, who
<>deserved killing and bidding good bye to the King,
<>went to the Peaks of the Hima1layas. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>13) {%Brahma1 and Haindavas.%} At the end of the day of
<>Brahma1 there was the great flood, and destroying all the
<>heavens, Brahma1 went to sleep. He woke up next morn-
<>ing and after the usual morning ablutions, prepared for
<>creation. He looked around at the sky, and saw some
<>heavens still engaged in usual activities. He was amazed
<>at this unusual occurrence. Ten Brahma1s and the count-
<>less devas (gods) under them were doing their routine
<>work. Brahma1 stared at the worlds for a long time think-
<>ing “How is it”. Then he by his divine power caused one
<>of the suns, working in a heaven, to come to him, and
<>asked him. “Who are you, shining one? How have these
<>worlds come into existence?”
<NI>The Sun said with humility. “Your sons Mari1ci and
<>others erected a beautiful shed called Suvarn2atat2am,
<>in a corner of Jam3budvi1pa in the valley below Kaila1sa.
<>A Bra1hman2a named Indu arose from that hall.
<>The Brahma1n2a who was a Vedic scholar, righteous
<>and peaceful, led the life of a house-holder with his
<>wife for a long time. But they were childless. So they
<>went to Kaila1sa and did penance to get children. They
<>entered a natural arbour which was quite silent and began
<>severe penance. S4iva appeared and said that they
<>would get children.
<NI>In course of time, ten sons were born to them. After
<>a long time, when the sons had reached manhood the
<>old parents died. The sons felt very sorry. They regarded
<>life as short and full of woe and misery. So they went for [Page153-a+ 65]
<>penance, as they had no relatives left to care for them.
<>They abstained from all the pleasures of the world and
<>reached Kaila1sa. They began to meditate upon the
<>shortness of life. “What is there which is noble in this
<>world? Is there anything except woe and misery? How
<>simple is the desire of man for greatness? One thinks
<>himself prosperous if he becomes a house-holder. The
<>head of the village is more prosperous than a house-
<>holder. The King of a dependent state is more powerful
<>than the head of a village. An independent king is far
<>more prosperous than a dependent King. When we
<>think of the state of an emperor how simple is an inde-
<>pendent king! When compared with Indra, the Lord
<>of the three worlds what is an emperor after all? But
<>there is nothing glorious in the state of Indra also as it
<>ends in a Brahmamuhu1rtta (a period in the life of
<>Brahma1). So what is there substantial and eternal?
<>“Brahma1 alone is eternal and indestructible.” said the
<>eldest brother. “Concentrate your mind and say to your-
<>self, ‘I am the supreme Being Brahma1 seated on a lotus’,
<>and meditate upon it and pray for it and knowledge of
<>Brahma1 will be conferred upon you.” They understood
<>this and thus the ten brothers became Brahma1s. There
<>are ten heavens of them. They are ten worlds in the
<>sky of mind. I am the sun who creates day and night in
<>one of them,” saying thus the Sun went away. Brahma1
<>commenced his activity. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>14) {%The age of Brahma1.%} Forty-three crores twenty lacs
<>of human years is one four-yuga period called ‘Deva-
<>caturyuga’ (a period of four yugas of the devas or gods).
<>One thousand deva caturyugas will make one Maha1yuga
<>(great yuga) A Maha1yuga is a day time of Brahma1.
<>During the period of one Maha1yuga, that is, during
<>one day of Brahma1, fourteen Manus, one after another,
<>help Brahma1 in doing the work of creation. This is the
<>time of the seventh Manu in the present day time
<>(Kalpa) of the present Brahma1. The period of six Manus
<>are over in the present day time of the present Brahma1.
<>Vaivasvata is the present Manu. Brahma1 wakes up in
<>the morning--the beginning of a Kalpa. Those which
<>underwent destruction in the night, are created again
<>in the morning. As Brahma1 wakes up daily in the morn-
<>ing, what are the things created before, which do not
<>undergo destruction? At that time there will remain,
<>without destruction, six or twentyfour tattvas (princi-
<>ples) which are natural creations. These twenty-four
<>principles are not the creation of Brahma1. He who is
<>beyond names, He who created Brahma1 in the lotus
<>flower, created them. Brahma1 who was originated in the
<>lotus which grew from the nave of Na1ra1yan2a performs
<>the work of creation guided by these twentyfour princi-
<>ples. The work of creation performed by Brahma1 is
<>called Pratisarga (substitute creation). Everything
<>Brahma1 created in the day time will be destroyed in the
<>evening. After a day time is over there is the night time
<>and sleep for Brahma1. The life of Brahma1 is hundred
<>years, that is thirty-six thousand Brahma1 days and
<>and Brahma1 nights. At the expiry of this period the life
<>of Brahma1 will come to an end, and will dissolve in
<>Na1ra1yan2a. Thus crores and crores of Brahma1s have
<>appeared and passed away and in future also crores
<>will appear and pass away. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>15) {%The creations and substitute creations of Brahma1.%} The
<>creations performed by Brahma1 are of two kinds. The
<>first is Sarga or creation and the second is Pratisarga or [Page153-b+ 63]
<>substitute creation. In the first Kalpa when a Brahma1
<>is born from the lotus, certain creations are made and
<>the things thus originated do not undergo destruction in
<>the evening or at the end of the Kalpa. They are the
<>sarga or creation. On that day and every day of the life
<>of Brahma1 they help Brahma1 in the work of creation.
<>In a sense they could be called Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). But as most of them have not left sons,
<>and for other reasons also, they are not well known by
<>that name. Only the persons mentioned here have as
<>long a life as that of Brahma1. The Sanakas, Karddama,
<>Mari1ci, Atri, An3giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhr2gu,
<>Vasis2t2ha, Daks2a, Na1rada, Dharma, Adharma, Nirr2ti,
<>Sarasvati1, Ka1ma, Atharva, the Manes, Agni, Stha1n2u,
<>and Sva1yam3bhuva: these do not end at the end of a
<>Brahma1's day (or Kalpa) and will be dissolved only when
<>Brahma1 is dissolved. A Brahma1 creates in his first morn-
<>ing not only persons from Sanaka to Sva1yam3bhuva, but
<>also creations which have a history only up to the end
<>of that day, such as the lokas (worlds) of Bhu1loka,
<>Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, and minerals, plants, animals,
<>humanity etc. Sarga or creation is called Pra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i
<>(natural creation). Pratisarga or substitute creation
<>is called Apra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i or unnatural creation. At the
<>end of the Kalpa, Sam3varttaka1gni (Fire which destroys
<>the universe) and Sam3varttaka vars2a1 (Rain which des-
<>troys the universe) will occur and all the unnatural crea-
<>tions will be destroyed. In all the morning, following
<>the first morning of a Brahma1 substitute creation takes
<>place, and they are destroyed at the end of each Kalpa
<>by Sam3varttaka1gni and Sam3varttakavars2a1. (Bha1ga-
<>vata).

<NI>(52) In almost all the Pura1n2as Brahma1 is called ‘Catur-
<>mukha’ (having four faces) and to substantiate this the
<>following story is given in the Matsyapura1n2a. Brahma1
<>created S4ataru1pa1 with half the portion of his body, and
<>accepted that bright and beautiful woman as his wife.
<>He could not bear his beautiful wife to be away from
<>his sight even for a moment. So much had he become
<>attached to her.
<NI>One day S4ataru1pa1 was walking round Brahma1. The
<>daughters born from his mind also were seated close by.
<>So he could not turn round and round and look at his
<>wife as she was moving. To solve this problem, in place
<>of one face, there arose four faces.
<NI>Once S4ataru1pa1 was walking in the air. To see her at
<>that time there arose a fifth head on the top of his matted
<>hair. It is this face that was plucked off by S4iva.
<NI>(53) Various stories occur in the pura1n2as regarding how
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1. They are
<>given below. [Page155-a+ 65]
<NI>(1) Once Brahma1 praised S4iva and pleased him and
<>asked him to become his son. S4iva did not like it. He
<>got angry and cursed, “I shall become your son. But I
<>will pluck off your fifth head.”
<NI>(2) In the beginning Brahma1 created the incarnation
<>of S4iva, called Ni1lalohita also, along with the creation
<>of worlds and everything in it. In later creations Brahma1
<>did not think of Ni1lalohita. Seeing Brahma1 carrying
<>on the work of creation forgetting him, Ni1lalohita got
<>angry and cursed Brahma1, “Your fifth head will shortly
<>be destroyed.”
<NI>(3) After Brahma1 became five-faced the brightness of
<>the devas began to decrease day by day. Seeing this the
<>conceited Brahma1 said to S4iva: “I am the first who got
<>existence in this world. So by all means I am the eldest.”
<>Hearing this S4iva got angry and plucked off the fifth
<>head of Brahma1 and threw it away. (Matsyapura1n2a,
<>183, 84-86).
<NI>When the fifth head was gone, the rest of the heads were
<>benumbed. The sweat which flowed from them was
<>thrown into the earth by Brahma1. Out of it came out
<>a horrible monster, which began to chase S4iva, who
<>caught hold of it and gave it to Vis2n2u. (Skanda, 5,
<>13, 4).
<NI>(4) In the S4iva-Rudra collections a story occurs about
<>the quarrel between S4iva and Brahma1.
<NI>Once Brahma1 fell in love with Sati1 the wife of S4iva;
<>coming to know of this S4iva tried to kill Brahma1. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u tried to pacify S4iva, but it was of no avail. S4iva
<>took away the fifth head of Brahma1 and made him ugly,
<>and consequently Brahma1 became invincible in the
<>world.
<NI>(5) Once S4iva showed his daughter Sandhya1 to Brahma1
<>who grew lustful instantly; S4iva insulted Brahma1 by
<>showing this ill-owned passion of his to his sons
<>(Brahma1's sons). As a revenge Brahma1 created Sati1
<>and insulted S4iva through Daks2a. (Skanda, 2, 2, 26).

<HI>BRAHMACARYA. In ancient India an ideal life was
<>considered to pass through four stages, and Brahma-
<>carya is one of the stages of life. The four stages
<>are Brahmacarya (Vedic student vowed to chastity),
<>Ga1rhasthya (married householder), Va1naprastha (forest
<>hermit) and Sannya1sa (an ascetic who has renounced
<>the world). Brahmacarya, the first stage of the four
<>is considered as the period of education. The rules and
<>conduct of a Brahmaca1ri1 are given in Manusmr2ti,
<>Chapter 2.
<NI>The brahmaca1ri1 who lives with the teacher has to obey
<>certain rules and principles. He should bathe in the
<>river at sun-rise and offer oblations to gods and manes.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 has to abstain from using honey, meat,
<>fragrance, flowers, flower of chrysanthemum (Ind.)
<>women, curd, milk, ghee, churned-curd, slaughter,
<>bath applying oil, anointing the eyes with collyrium,
<>sandals, umbrella, lust, anger, covetousness, dance,
<>music, gambling, slander, ridicule, falsehood, and
<>causing injury to others. A Brahmaca1ri1 should go to
<>bed alone. Semen should not be made to discharge
<>through lust. If seminal discharge occurs in dream he
<>should take bath early in the morning and worship the
<>Sun, pronouncing the mantra or spell ‘Punah2’ thrice.
<>The Brahmaca1ri1 should live on alms. It is the duty of
<>the brahmaca1ri1 to bring water, flower for oblation,
<>cowdung, soil and darbha (grass) for the teacher. He
<>should receive alms only from the houses of those who
<>believe in the Vedas and sacrifices. He should not go
<>to the house of his teacher or his heirs and their families
<>for alms. Provided there are no other houses he may
<>receive alms from the houses of his teacher's relatives
<>and in the absence of such houses he may approach
<>the houses of heirs to his teacher and in the absence
<>of such houses he may receive alms from the house of
<>the teacher. He should fetch ‘Camata’ (fuel chiefly
<>from butea frondosa) from a place of purity in the [Page156-a+ 65]
<>forest, as instructed in rules and dry it in the sun; in
<>the absence of which it may be got dried in a sheltered
<>place. This fuel should be put in the sacrificial fire in
<>the mornings, at noons, and in the evenings. If a healthy
<>Brahmaca1ri1 fails in doing his duties consecutively for
<>seven days it will be considered that his vow of Brahma-
<>carya is broken and then he will have to take the vow
<>of ‘Avaki1rn2i’ again. Without waiting for the order of
<>the teacher, the Brahmaca1ri1 (student) should engage
<>himself in devotion and meditation and in the service
<>of the teacher daily. When the student is before the
<>teacher he should stand with folded hands controlling
<>his body, speech, brains, sensitive organs, and mind.
<>Only when he is asked to sit, should he do so before
<>the teacher, covering the portions of his body, which
<>are to be covered, with clothes. He should rise up in
<>the morning before his teacher wakes up, and go to
<>bed only after the teacher has retired for sleep. When
<>his teacher calls him, he should not give reply lying,
<>sitting, walking, eating or looking in the opposite
<>direction. He should not gainsay the teacher. The
<>student should attend to the orders of the teacher and
<>comply with them, sitting if the teacher is sitting,
<>standing if the teacher is standing, standing back if the
<>teacher is advancing towards him, running behind if
<>he is walking, standing close by when he is facing the
<>opposite direction, folding his limbs when the teacher
<>is lying or sitting near. The student should have his
<>seat and bed one step lower than those of his teacher.
<>The student should not sit in a careless manner in
<>places where the teacher's eyes could reaeh. He should
<>not utter the name of his teacher. If anybody speaks ill
<>of his teacher he should close his ears and run away
<>from the spot. If a Brahmaca1ri1 scoffs his teacher, he
<>will be born as a donkey, and as a dog if he scorns him,
<>and as a worm if he steals the wealth of his teacher
<>and as a beetle if he becomes jealous at the greatness
<>of his teacher. When the teacher is angry the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 should not go near him. The Brahmaca1ri1 should
<>not speak unasked. A Brahmaca1ri1 could sit with his
<>teacher only when they are in a vehicle, or on a camel
<>or in a tower or on the steps or on rocks or in a boat. He
<>should consider the teacher of his teacher as his teacher.
<>He should not address his parents who visit the house
<>of the teacher, without the permission of his teacher. He
<>should respect learned men, holymen, sons of the
<>teacher and those who are born of his family, as a
<>teacher. If the wife of the teacher is of the caste of the
<>teacher, the brahmaca1ri1 should consider her as his
<>teacher. If the wife is not of the same caste the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 needs only to stand up and make obeisance to her.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 should not apply oil to the body of his
<>teacher's wife, wash her, massage her body, and comb
<>her hair. A brahmaca1ri1 may either shave his head or
<>grow matted hair. He should never be asleep at sunrise
<>or sunset. For learning Vedas etc. the student should not
<>give the teacher cows, clothes etc. as free gifts before-
<>hand. On completion of education, when the student
<>asks the teacher for permission to get married, he should
<>give the teacher what he demands. A brahmaca1ri1 who
<>has fully complied with the rules mentioned above,
<>will attain heaven after his death.

<>III, Chapter 10, there is a story stating how the
<>seven sons of Kaus4ika, a hermit, became fishermen by
<>a curse and how they got absolution and attainment
<>of heaven by offering oblations to the manes. The
<>story is given below. Brahmadatta was the rebirth of
<>Pitr2vartti, one of those seven sons.
<NI>In days of old there was a hermit named Kaus4ika in
<>Kuruks2etra. His seven sons, S4varu1pa, Krodhana,
<>Him3sra, Pis4una, Kavi, Va1gdus2t2a and Pitr2vartti were
<>studying under Garga, a teacher. Their deeds were as
<>bad as their names indicated. Their father died. The
<>sons were in want. There was no rain anywhere in the
<>world. These brothers had taken the milking cow of
<>their teacher Garga to the forest for grazing. They
<>decided to kill the cow of their teacher. The youngest
<>of them said, “If we kill the cow we can use it as
<>offerings to the manes, and the sin will not be visited
<>on us.” The elder brothers agreed to it. Accordingly
<>Pitr2vartti killed the cow and began sacrifice to the
<>manes. Two of the elder brothers were detailed to give
<>oblations to the devas, and three of them to offer
<>oblations to the manes. One was detailed to be the
<>guest and himself as the sacrificer. Thus remembering
<>the manes the sacrifice was completed with the neces-
<>sary rituals. In short, those seven hermits got divine
<>power and became daring wicked men and ate the cow
<>of their teacher. They told the teacher that the cow
<>was eaten by a leopard and gave him the calf.
<NI>In course of time they all died and were born again as
<>wild men in Das4apura. But because of their offerings to
<>the manes they had retained memory of their previous
<>births. So they fasted in holy baths and discarded their
<>lives before the people. They were born again as deer
<>in the mount of Ka1lan5jara. Because of the power of
<>knowledge and the penance and fast they discarded
<>the body of deer in Prapatana and got rebirth as
<>Cakrava1ka (ruddy goose) in the lake called Ma1nasa-
<>saras. In this birth their names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<>Vasu, Citradars4i, Sudars4i, Jn5a1ta and Jn5a1napa1raga,
<>names suitable to their character. Those seven loving
<>brothers were saints by virtue of their harmony with
<>the Supreme spirit. But owing to mental disturbance
<>three of them lost their attainments. Seeing the plea-
<>sures that King An2uha of Pa1n5ca1la was enjoying by
<>his wealth, vehicles, big army and beautiful women
<>one of the Cakrava1kas, Pitr2vartti, the devoted Bra1h-
<>man2a, who being loyal to his father had performed
<>sacrifice and given offerings to the manes, desired to
<>become a king. The other two brothers seeing the
<>wealth, glory and power of the two ministers, wished
<>to become ministers. Thus Pitr2vartti was born as the
<>son of An2uha with the name Brahmadatta and the
<>other two were born as Pun2d2ari1ka and Suba1laka, sons of
<>the two ministers. Brahmadatta was anointed as King of [Page157-a+ 65]
<>Pa1n5ca1la in the great city of Ka1m3pilya. The King
<>loved his father. He was mighty and powerful. He was
<>regular in performing sacrifices and giving offerings to
<>the manes. He had the attainment of harmony with
<>the supreme spirit. He understood the thought and
<>speech of birds and animals. He married Sannati, the
<>daughter of Sudeva (Devala); she was in her former
<>birth the cow of Garga.
<NI>Once as the King was walking in the garden with his
<>wife, he saw two ants. The minute creatures, who
<>were husband and wife were engaged in a petty quar-
<>rel. The male one, with loving words, pacified the
<>female one, who instantly came close to her husband
<>and they became happy. The King felt amazed at this
<>conversation of the ants, and he laughed. Because of
<>the attainments of his previous lives, he had the power
<>to understand the language of animals, birds, etc.
<>Seeing the King laughing without any reason the queen
<>Sannati asked him why he laughed. She said that
<>there was no reason whatsoever for the king to laugh
<>just then. The King replied, “Oh, beautiful one! just
<>now there was a quarrel between a female and a male
<>ant. I heard it, That is why I laughed. There is no
<>other reason.” The queen did not believe the King.
<>She thought that the King had been scoffing her. She
<>asked him how he came to understand the language
<>of such creatures. The King could not answer her
<>question. He fasted for seven days. On the seventh
<>day Brahma1 appeared before him and told him, “The
<>King will know everything from the words of a
<>Bra1hmin, whom he would meet when he goes to walk
<>in the streets.”
<NI>Brahmadatta returned to the palace and spent the
<>night there. Next morning he started with his wife and
<>ministers, for a walk. When they left the palace they
<>saw an old Brahmin coming towards them. Seeing the
<>king the Bra1hmin recited a verse:
<Poem>“Bra1hman2as in Kuruks2etra
<>which seven as wild men in Das4apura?
<>Stags in Ka1lan5jara, ruddy geese in Ma1nasa,
<>Then, are we, now living here”.</Poem>
<NI>When the King heard this verse the memory of his
<>former births revived and he fell down in a swoon.
<NI>There is a reason why the old Bra1hmin recited the
<>verse. The Ruddy geese mentioned before took their
<>next birth as sons of a poor Bra1hmin in the same city.
<>They had the memory of their previous births. They
<>were called Dhr2tima1n, Sarvadars4i, Vidya1candra and
<>Tapodhika, names suitable to their character. The
<>Brahmin boys decided to go for penance to attain su-
<>preme bliss. Then the poor father asked them, “My dear
<>sons, what is this? You are going away leaving your
<>poor and aged father. Is that dutiful? The sons replied,
<>“We will tell you a way to earn wealth. You recite to
<>the King, to-morrow morning this verse, which we
<>will teach you now. You will get plenty of wealth.”
<>The boys taught their father this verse and then they
<>went to the forest. Their father, the old Brahmin, came
<>to the gate of the palace at Ka1m3pilya. The King was
<>Brahmadatta.
<NI>There is another story how Brahmadatta became the
<>King of this place. Long ago An2uha, the King of Pa1n5ca1la
<>did penance before Brahma1, who appeared before the
<>King and asked him what he desired. The King made
<>his request that he might have a son who should be a [Page157-b+ 64]
<>mighty hero, a learned man, a great hermit and who
<>could understand the language of all living creatures.
<>Brahma1 granted him boon and thus Brahmadatta was
<>born to An2uha. It was before this Brahmadatta that
<>the Bra1hman2a recited his verse and it was that King
<>who swooned and fell down.
<NI>The two ministers were Suba1laka the son of Ba1bhravya
<>who was the author of the Ka1mas4a1stra and Pun2d2ari1ka
<>the son of Pa1n5ca1la who propagated the science of
<>medicine. They also remembered about their former
<>births and also fell down unconscious. When they
<>recovered the King Brahmadatta and the minister
<>Subala and Pun2d2ari1ka bemoaned the loss of powers
<>they had attained before by devotion, meditation,
<>penance and sacrifice. They cried, “Fate has made us
<>desirous of the objects of our senses and we have lost our
<>harmony with the Supreme Spirit.” They repeated the
<>cry again and again and they spoke about the blessings
<>obtained by offering oblation to their manes. Brahma-
<>datta gave the old Bra1hman2a plenty of wealth and
<>several villages and sent him fully satisfied. Then he
<>anointed his capable and fully qualified son Vis2vaksena
<>as King and with his retinue retired to Ma1nasa-saras
<>for penance.
<NI>3) {%A bird as his wife when he was King.%} When Brahma-
<>datta was the King of Ka1m3pilyapura a bird named
<>Tapani1ya1 become his friend. Her head was purple
<>coloured and body black. By and by this bird became
<>his wife. A daughter named Sarvasena1 was born to
<>Brahmadatta by his bird-wife. The King had sons by
<>other wives. Tapani1ya1 would wash her child and place
<>her in the cradle early in the morning and then
<>go to the forest and fly about in the air. She would
<>return in the evening and tell the King news all over
<>the world. It went on like this for a long time.
<NI>Once, when there was nobody in the room a prince
<>took Sarvasena1 from the cage and choked her to death.
<>Tapani1ya1 returned and seeing the dead body of her
<>daughter, waited for a long time. Finally she pecked
<>out the eyes of the prince and flew away into the air.
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 20).
<HI>BRAHMADATTA II. Another King who ruled over
<>Ka1m3pilya. This King was the son of the hermit Cu1li
<>and his wife Somada1, a Gandharva woman whose
<>mother was U1rmila1. When he was ruling Ka1m3pilya,
<>Kus4ana1bha was the King of Ka1nyakubja. One hund-
<>red beautiful daughters were born to the King
<>Kus4ana1bha. One day while they were playing in the
<>jungle Va1yubhagava1n (wind-god) saw them and grew
<>lustful. But they did not yield to his request. So he got
<>angry and cursed them and they became hump-backed.
<>The King was very sorry. He presented his hundred
<>hunch-backed daughters to King Brahmadatta, who,
<>by his divine power straightened their backs. When
<>they regained their former form they became the wives
<>of Brahmadatta. This story occurs in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sargas 32 & 33.
<HI>BRAHMADATTA III. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhavis2ya Parva, Chapter 104, about another Brahma-
<>datta. He was the King of Sa1lva. Though he had two
<>wives he had no children. Finally by the grace of
<>S4iva two children were born to them. They were called
<>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka. (For further information see
<>D2ibhaka). [Page158-a+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMADATTA IV. A king who ruled over the coun-
<>try of Ka1s4i. One night he saw two swans flying in the
<>air. They were of golden colour. There were a num-
<>ber of swans around them. They seemed like two
<>lightnings in the midst of white clouds. Brahmadatta
<>wished to see them again. His desire increased to such
<>an extent that he had desire for nothing else. He
<>consulted his ministers and made a lake. Every crea-
<>ture which seemed beautiful to him was brought to
<>that place. Hearing this those two swans also came
<>there. By and by he tamed them and asked them how
<>they got the golden colour. The swans said thus:
<>“Oh King! you might have heard of the famous moun-
<>tain Mandara, which is the field of games of the Devas
<>(gods). At the time of the churning of the milk sea
<>when this mountain was used as churn-drill, Amr2tam3
<>(celestial nectar of immortality) touched this moun-
<>tain. So the flowers, fruits and roots in the vicinity of
<>this mountain got the power of removing death, wrin-
<>kles etc. Candracu1d2a also will come to this mountain
<>occasionally to play on the top of it and so it became
<>more glorious than the mount Kaila1sa. One day
<>while Maha1deva was playing in those gardens he had
<>to leave on an urgent matter concerning Gods. So he
<>left Pa1rvati1 there and went away. Devi1 began to walk
<>about in those gardens with pangs of separation.
<>Spring season came. The Gan2as (servants of S4iva) and
<>the maids of Pa1rvati1 attended on her. One day Man2i-
<>pus2pes4vara, a Gan2a, hankered after Candralekha1,
<>daughter of Jaya1. She had been engaged in fanning
<>Pa1rvati1. Both were young and their figures suited each
<>other. Candralekha1 reciprocated his love. Under-
<>standing this Pin3ges4vara and Guhes4vara, two gan2as
<>looked at each other and smiled. Seeing this Devi1
<>looked round with anger to see what caused them to
<>smile. They squinted their eyes and showed Manipus2-
<>pe vara and Candralekha1 to Devi1. Because of separation
<>she had been much worried, weary and sad. So all
<>these affairs made her angry. She said: “It is good
<>that you behave like this when I am in this plight !
<>The two are making love. Seeing that, you are laughing.
<>May these two dotards be born on the earth and be-
<>come husband and wife there. Let you two who
<>laughed before me without humility also be born on
<>the earth, first as poor Bra1hman2as, and then as
<>Brahmaraks2as (demon friends), outcasts, robbers,
<>dogs with tails cut off and finally as various kind of
<>birds.” Thus she cursed the four of gan2as. Then a
<>gan2a named Dhu1rjat2a said to Pa1rvati1: “Devi1, this is
<>unfortunate. They have not commited any severe
<>crime.” Devi1 got angry at him and cursed him too:
<>“May you also be born on the earth as a human be-
<>ing.” After this Jaya the loved maid of Pa1rvati1 reques-
<>ted her for absolution from curse, for all. The Devi1
<>said that all of them would get absolution at the place
<>of penance of Brahma1 and other gods and would re-
<>turn here. Of these, Candralekha1 and her husband and
<>Dhu1rjat2a would be happy on the earth. The two
<>others would lead a miserable life on the earth.”
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Padma1vati1lam3baka, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>BRAHMADEVA. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas against the Kauravas in the battle of
<>Maha1bha1rata. His duty was to protect the army in
<>the rear. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 196,
<>Stanza 25). [Page158-b+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMA1DUM3BARA. A holy place in Kuruks2etra. In
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Stanza 71, it
<>is said that this place is auspicious to Brahma1.
<HI>BRAHMAHATYA1. Killing a Bra1hman2a is called Brahma-
<>hatya1. In ancient India killing a Bra1hmin was consi-
<>dered to be a great sin. He, who committed this sin
<>had to build a hut in the forest and live there for a
<>period of twelve years, or make an alms-pot called
<>‘S4ivas4irodhvaja’ and wander about begging alms, to
<>purify his soul, or else to attempt to jump into a
<>blazing fire thrice with bowed head, or perform one
<>of the three sacrifices As4vamedha, Svarjit or Gosava.
<>If none of these was possible, he had to give all the
<>wealth he had to Bra1hmins well-versed in Vedas, as
<>gift. It is mentioned in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 169, that
<>if any of the vows mentioned above was performed he
<>would be absolved from the sin of Brahmahatya1.
<HI>BRAHMAJIT. A son of Ka1lanemi. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>35:38).
<HI>BRAHMAMEDHYA1. A river, famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>Mention is made about this river in Maha1bha1rata
<>Bhi1s2maparva, Chapter 9, Stanza 32.
<HI>BRA1HMAMUHU1RTA. The period of forty-eight minutes
<>before the sunrise is called Bra1hmamuhu1rta. The
<>deity of this period is Brahma1. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 155, it is instructed that one should wake up at
<>this period and engage in prayer and meditation.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A. (BRA1HMIN).
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} Bra1hman2as, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas, and S4u1dras
<>are the caturvarn2as or the four castes. The Pura1n2as say
<>that the four castes originated from different parts of
<>the body of Brahma1. See Manusmr2ti, Chapter 1,
<>Stanza 87
<Poem>“Sarvasya1sya tu sargasya
<>Guptyartham3 sa maha1dyutih2
<>Mukhaba1hu1ru1pajja1na1m3
<>Pr2thakkarma1n2yakalpayat.</Poem>
<NI>(With a view to sustain the world, Brahma1 ordered acti-
<>vities, for the four castes (Bra1hman2a Ks2atriya, Vais4ya,
<>and S4u1dra) who were born from his face, arms, thighs
<>and feet). From this statement it is seen that the Bra1h-
<>man2as were born from the face, Ks2atriyas from the
<>arms, Vais4yas from the thighs and Su1dras from the feet
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>2) {%The activities of a Bra1hman2a.%} The duties of a Bra1hman2a
<>are, performing sacrifice, and encouraging others to
<>perform sacrifice, learning Vedas and teaching Vedas,
<>giving gifts and getting remuneration. A Bra1hman2a has
<>two births in one life. Till the time of investiture with
<>the sacred string is one birth and from that period on-
<>wards is the second birth. So a Bra1hman2a is called
<>‘dvija’ or twice-born.
<NI>The Bra1hman2as were allowed to do the works of agri-
<>culture, keeping cows, trade and commerce and Kusi1da
<>(money-lending). Living on the interest of money
<>giving out as loan is Kusi1da. But they should not trade
<>on products from cow, jaggery, salt, lac and flesh.
<>The suffix ‘S4arma1’ should be added to the name of
<>Bra1hman2a. A Bra1hman2a can have four wives.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A(M). See Veda.
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2A. The word Brahma1n2d2a means the an2d2a
<>of Brahma1 (an2d2a-egg), the Supreme Being which is
<>the root of the origin of the universe. At a time long
<>ago, which is beyond reckoning, there was nothing but
<>an egg. This egg was split into two and from it a male [Page159-a+ 64]
<>child with the radiance of innumerable suns came out.
<>This wonderful child was helpless. After his birth he
<>cried for a while, because of hunger and thirst. He
<>got no help. There was nobody to feed it. So this
<>wonderful child looked up and lay there. This help-
<>less child was called ‘Vira1t2purus2a’ (the next emanation
<>from Brahma1) by those versed in the Pura1n2as. The
<>boy was so called because he was the most material
<>of materiality. But he was an atom of atoms and the
<>first figuration of God. From each pore of the skin of
<>the great vira1t2, who was the base of all the worlds a
<>universe came into being. Thus all the countless uni-
<>verses were born. Each universe has its own trinity of
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and devas (the bright ones), the
<>protectors of the eight zones. One universe comprises
<>fourteen worlds or realms, from Pa1ta1la to the Brahma-
<>loka (from the nether world to the upper world or
<>the realm of Brahma1). Countless such universes exist.
<>Over and above all these universes there is Vaikun2t2ha,
<>and above Vaikun2t2ha there is another world with an
<>area of fifty crore yojanas (leagues), called ‘Goloka’ (the
<>world of cow). Only the two worlds Vaikun2t2ha and
<>the Goloka are eternal. Bhu1loka (the earth) consists
<>of seven islands and sixty-four peninsulas. There are
<>seven worlds above and seven worlds below. The seven
<>upper worlds are Bhu1loka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Jana-
<>loka, Tapoloka. Satyaloka and Brahmaloka. Thus a
<>universe consists of fourteen worlds. This is the idea
<>given by the Pura1n2as about Brahma1n2d2a. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandhas 9).
<NI>Mention is made, in the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2,
<>Chapter 7, about the construction of Brahma1n2d2a.
<NI>This Brahma1n2d2a, like the seed of the Kapittha tree
<>(Vitar--the wood-apple), is covered under, above and
<>all around by an2d2akat2a1ha (egg-shell). The an2d2a (egg)
<>is covered by water ten times the egg in volume. This
<>water-shell is covered by a shell of fire. Around the
<>shell of fire there is the shell of air and the air-shell
<>is covered with ether. Around the shell of ether there
<>is the shell of Egoism of darkness. Over the shell of
<>Egoism there is the shell of glory and the shell of
<>glory is covered by Prakr2ti, the Divine Nature. It is
<>immeasurable. Prakr2ti contains numberless Brah-
<>ma1n2d2as. As oil exists in sesame, God pervades the whole
<>universe. This is the connection between Prakr2ti and
<>Purus2a. (The Nature and the Supreme Spirit).
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2APURA1N2A. One of the eighteen pura1n2as.
<>This pura1n2a contains a talk by Brahma1 about the glory
<>of Brahma1n2d2a. There are twelve thousand verses in
<>this pura1n2a. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 272).
<HI>BRA1HMAN2IPPA1T2T2U. (Pa1t2t2u = song). A performance
<>connected with the temples of Kerala.
<HI>BRAHMA1N5JALI. When a disciple stands before his
<>teacher he should have both his arms folded. Folding
<>both arms in this way is called Brahma1n5jali. (Manu-
<>smr2ti, Chapter 2).
<HI>BRAHMAPRALAYA. See Manvantara.
<HI>BRAHMAPURA1N2A, (BRA1HMAPURA1N2A). This is a
<>great book of twenty-five thousand verses taught to
<>the great hermit-sage Mari1ci by Brahma1. It is mention-
<>ed in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 271, that if a copy of this
<>book is taken and offered to a Brahmin on the full
<>moon day of the month of Vais4a1kha with cow and
<>water, the giver will attain heaven. [Page159-b+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMAPURI1. The abode of Brahma1. Brahmapuri1 is
<>on the summit of Maha1meru, with an area of fourteen
<>thousand yojanas (leagues). Around this city, at the
<>four sides, (East etc.) and at the four corners (South-
<>East etc.) there are eight towns, very big and beautiful,
<>kept by eight protectors such as Indra and others. The
<>river Gan3ga1 which springs from the feet of Maha1vis2n2u
<>wets the whole of Candraman2d2ala (Lunar region),
<>falls down on the Brahmapuri1, and dividing itself into
<>four rivers called Si1ta1, Alakananda1, Caks2us and Bhadra1
<>flows in four directions. The river Si1ta1 flows through
<>the top of the mountains and passing through the
<>mountain in the east called Bhadra1s4va, falls in the
<>Eastern Ocean. The river Alakananda1 flows to the
<>south and reaches Bha1rata. Then it divides into seven
<>rivers which unite in the ocean. The river Caks2us pas-
<>ses through the mountains in the west and enters the
<>country called Ketuma1lavars2a and then flows into the
<>ocean. The river Bhadra1 passes through all the moun-
<>tains in the north and flows through the north country
<>of the Kuru1s2a and falls in the North Ocean. The moun-
<>tain of Ma1lyava1n in the west and the mountain of
<>Gandhama1dana in the east are as long as the moun-
<>tain of Ni1lagiri in the north and the mountain of
<>Nis2adha in the south. Mount Meru shaped like an ear-
<>ring stands in the middle of these four mountains.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 21).
<HI>BRAHMAS4A1LA1. A holy place. It is mentioned in Maha1-

<>moment one visits this holy Bath in the river Gan3ges,
<>one would attain heaven.
<HI>BRAHMASARAS. A holy place in Dharma1ran2ya. If a
<>man fasts in this holy place for one night, he would
<>reach the world of Brahma1. In this holy place there is
<>a peg driven down by Brahma1 himself. One who walks
<>round this peg will attain the fruits of performing a
<>Va1japeya yajn5a (a drinking sacrifice). There is another
<>holy bath of the name Brahmasaras in Gaya1. (M.B.

<>S4iva. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 138, Stanza 9, that Agastya gave this weapon
<>to Agnives4a, who gave it to Dron2a and Dron2a gave it to
<>Arjuna and instructed him about the use of it as
<>follows:
<NI>“You should never shoot this arrow at man. If it is
<>used against mean people the three worlds would be
<>destroyed. It is said that this weapon has no parallel
<>in the world. Keep this pure, and give ear to what I
<>say. If an enemy, other than human being attacks you,
<>this weapon may be used to kill him in battle.”
<HI>BRAHMATI1RTHA. A holy place in Kuruks2etra. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83,

<HI>BRAHMA1VARTTA. A holy place situated in Kuruk-
<>s2etra. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Stanza 53, that he who takes a bath in
<>this holy place will go to the world of Brahma1. Manu-
<>smr2ti, Chapter 2, Stanza 17, refers to this Brahma1vartta.
<>Manu says as follows:

<NI>The Bra1hman2a should rinse his mouth three times.
<>Then he should wipe his mouth twice and face once.
<>Then he should take water in his hand and sprinkle

<>with an army of three aks2auhin2i1s (an aks2auhin2i is a
<>complete army consisting of 21870 horses and 109350
<>infantry). Though he had married two daughters of
<>the King of Ka1s4i he was childless. The sorrowful king
<>went with his wives to a hermit named Can2d2akaus4ika
<>and pleased him by giving him precious stones. The
<>King told the hermit about his sorrow due to lack of
<>children. The hermit gave them a mango fruit and
<>said that the King should enthrone the son who would
<>be born by eating the mango, and return to the forest
<>for penance. The hermit gave eight boons for the son
<>who was to be born.
<NI>The King and his wives returned to the palace and
<>divided the mango fruit into two and both of his wives
<>ate the fruit and became pregnant. Each of them gave
<>birth to half of a child. The lifeless forms of these half
<>children were thrown out. A giantess called Jara1 put
<>them together and instantly the pieces joined together
<>and became a living child. The giantess took that child
<>and made a present of it to the King. That child grew up
<>and was known by the famous name Jara1sandha. From
<>that time onwards Giantess-worship began in Magadha.
<>When Jara1sandha came of age the King anointed him
<>as King and went to the hermitage of Can2d2akaus4ika
<>with his wives and began to do penance. After coming
<>to the forest Br2hadratha killed a giant named R2s2abha
<>and with his hide made three Big drums and placed
<>them in the city. The sound of one beat on the drum
<>will last for a month. When Bhi1ma, Arjuna and S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a came to Magadha to kill Jara1sandha they broke
<>these drums. (M.B. A1di Parva, 53; Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapters 17, 19 and 21).

<HI>BR2HANTA1. One of the seven mothers of Subrahman2ya.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 118, Stanza 10).
<HI>BR2HASPATI. The teacher of the devas (Gods).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The father of Br2haspati was An3giras, the
<>son of Brahma1. Brahma1 grew amorous, at the sight of
<>some celestial maids who were present at a sacrifice
<>performed by Rudra; and he had seminal flow.
<>Brahma1 put the semen in fire. From that fire the devas
<>such as Mari1ci, Bhr2gu, An3giras and others were born.
<>The name An3giras was given because he was born out
<>of an3ga1ra (live-coal). Eight sons were born to An3giras
<>by his wife Vasuda1. They were Utathya, Br2haspati,
<>Vayasya, S4a1nti, Ghora, Viru1pa, Sam3varta and Sudh-
<>anva1. All of them were sages who had attained one-
<>ness with the supreme Spirit by knowledge, and who
<>had been free from worldly pain. Of them Br2haspati,
<>Utathya and Sam3varta became famous through all
<>the worlds. In some pura1n2as Vasuda1, the mother of
<>Br2haspati, is given the name S4raddha1 also.
<NI>It is stated that Br2haspati had a sister named A1n3girasi1.
<>She was a follower of the Brahma1 cult. She became
<>the wife of Prabha1sa the last one of the eight Vasus.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 218 that the mother of Br2haspati had another name, S4ubha1, and that Br2has-
<>pati had six more brothers, born later, named Br2hatki1rti, Br2hatjyoti, Br2hadbrahma1, Br2hadmana1, Br2hadmantra, and Br2hadbha1sa and that
<>A1n3girasi1 had the name Bha1numati1 also.</F>
<>Vis4vakarma1 was her son. (Bha1gavata Skandha 4, Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 66).
<NI>2) {%Is Br2haspati the son of Agni?%} In some pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is described as the son of Agni. Its authority
<>is given below. An3giras, the father of Br2haspati was
<>once doing penance in his hermitage. When the fire of
<>penance increased the brightness of the real fire
<>decreased. Agni (fire) stood before An3giras and said
<>“Oh Lord! your brightness surpasses mine. From this
<>day onwards you are the real fire. So you shall be the
<>first fire and I will be the fire of Praja1pati which is the
<>second fire.”
<NI>Because of this boon of Agni, the devas (gods), recog-
<>nized An3giras also as a fire-god. So in some Pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is mentioned as the son of Agni (fire-god).
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 4). [Page162-b+ 62]
<NI>3) {%Teacher of the Devas.%} The story of how Br2haspati
<>became the teacher of the devas, is given in the
<>Bha1s2a1bha1rata, Chapter 76 as shown below:
<NI>“The Suras and the asuras (the gods and the demons)
<>became enemies from time immemorial, regarding the
<>possession of wealth and prosperity in the three worlds.
<>To secure victory in the battles the gods made Br2has-
<>pati their teacher and likewise the asuras made S4ukra
<>their teacher.”
<NI>The devas and asuras began to fight for prosperity
<>and wealth. At that time the devas selected Br2haspati
<>and the asuras selected S4ukra, as their teacher.
<NI>4) {%The conjugality of Br2haspati.%} Ta1ra1 was the wife of
<>Br2haspati. She was very beautiful. Seeing Candra's
<>handsome figure she doted on him. There arose several
<>quarrels over this affair. Finally the devas intervened
<>and Ta1ra1 was given back to Br2haspati1. Budha was
<>born to Candra by Ta1ra1.
<NI>The individual called Ta1ra in the family of the monkeys,
<>was a son of Br2haspati. It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 17, Stanza 10 as follows,
<>which proves this fact.
<NI>“Br2haspati begot the mighty monkey Ta1ra.” In the
<>R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 19, Su1kta 126, it is
<>mentioned that Br2haspati had a daughter named
<>Romas4a1. When her husband teased her Romas4a1 said
<>to her husband: “You please come and feel your
<>hand on my body. Don't think that my organs are
<>small. Though I am hairy like the goats of Ga1ndha1ra,
<>I have got all the organs fully grown.” This is the
<>statement in the R2gveda. In the Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>it is stated that Br2haspati had a Bra1hman2a son named
<>Kus4adhvaja, and that a daughter named Devavati1 was
<>born to Kus4adhvaja. Devavati1 was born from his
<>mouth while Kus4adhvaja was engaged in devotional
<>recitation of the Vedas. Si1ta1 was the rebirth of this
<>Devavati1. It is stated in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 67, Stanza 69, that Dron2a, the son of Bhara-
<>dva1ja, was born from a portion of Br2haspati. Kaca was
<>another son of Br2haspati. For full particulars of the
<>story how Devaya1ni1 (daughter of S4ukra) hankered
<>after Kaca, see ‘Kaca’. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza 1,
<>that Br2haspati had a wife called Ca1ndramasi1 and that
<>she gave birth to six Agnis. In Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a mention is made that Br2haspati had a
<>daughter named Sulekha1. Six sons and a daughter
<>were born to Ca1ndramasi1. The six sons were six Agnis
<>(fires): In sacrifices the burnt offerings and the ghee
<>were the portions meant for the great and mighty fire
<>S4amyu, the son of Br2haspati. It is to satisfy this great
<>fire which blazes with numberless pointed tongues, that
<>in sacrifices such as Ca1turma1sya, As4vamedha etc. ani-
<>mals are slaughtered. The daughter of Dharma was
<>the wife of S4am3yu. The name of the wonderful being
<>(S4amyu's wife) is Satya1. A son named Di1pti and three
<>daughters were born to S4amyu. The son of Di1pti is
<>Bharadva1ja who is the recipient of first portion of Ghee
<>oblated in sacrifice. On all full-moon days offerings
<>of sacrifices are meant for Bharata. Bharata had a son
<>named Bha1rata and a daughter named Bha1rati1. Bharata
<>the Agni is said to be the son of the Agni who is Praja1- [Page163-a+ 65]
<>pati Bharata. Thus Bharata got the famous name ‘the
<>great’. Bharata married Vi1ra1 and a son was born to
<>them called Vi1ra. This Vi1ra like Soma is the recipient
<>of sacrificial ghee, according to the belief of the Bra1h-
<>man2as. As this Vi1ra is the recipient of the second ghee
<>offered in sacrifice, as Soma, he is known by names
<>such as Rathaprabhu, Rathadhva1na and Kumbharetas.
<>Vi1ra married Sarayu1 and became the father of Siddhi--
<>Siddhi the Agnidevata1--who is remembered in all
<>fire songs. Fire which has no action on prosperity,
<>fame and vigour has the name Nis4cyavana. Nis4cya-
<>vana praises the earth. Satya is the son of Nis4cyavana.
<>Satya which blazes by flame determines time. Satya is
<>known by another name Nis2kr2ti. The Agni Svana
<>spreads diseases. The Agnis called Vipulaprabha, Yat-
<>a1tma1 and Brahmaca1ri are invoked in simple domestic
<>sacrifices by Bra1hman2as. The awful fire Bad2ava1gni is
<>supported by life. The sixth son of Br2haspati and Ta1ra1
<>is called S4vetakr2t. The oblation offered to this Agni
<>is known as Udadva1ra. Sva1ha1 was the daughter of
<>Ca1ndramasi1. Sva1ha1 had three sons. They are three
<>Agnis called Ka1ma1gni, Amogha, and Ukthya. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 4).
<NI>5) {%Growing amorous on the wife of elder brother.%} A story
<>stating how Br2haspati begot a son by the wife of
<>Utathya is given in Skandha 9 of Bha1gavata. Mamata1,
<>the wife of Utathya, was pregnant. Br2haspati had
<>coition with her when her husband was away. The
<>mother and the child in the womb who opposed the
<>act of Br2haspati were cursed. Mamata1 gave birth to two
<>children. Fearing that her husband might cast her out
<>she left the son of Br2haspati in the forest and was
<>about to go, when there was a divine voice from above,
<>“Mu1d2he, Bharadva1jamimam bhara dva1jam3 Br2has-
<>pate.” “You senseless woman, bring up this one born
<>of the two. Br2haspati, bring up this one born of the
<>two.” Hearing this ethereal voice Br2haspati took the
<>child and gave him the name Bharadva1ja and brought
<>him up. After that the child was given to emperor
<>Bharata. The famous archer Dron2a was the son of this
<>Bharadva1ja.
<NI>6) {%Personation of Br2haspati.%} The enmity between the
<>devas and asuras increased day by day. S4ukra1ca1rya
<>the teacher of the asuras began to do penance before
<>S4iva in the Hima1layas, with a view to get a divine
<>spell or incantation to destroy the devas. The duration
<>of the penance was thousand years. Indra came to
<>know of this secret and sent his daughter Jayanti1 to
<>get the spell from S4ukra by deceit. She stayed with
<>S4ukra as his disciple and servant. Thousand years passed
<>by. S4iva appeared before S4ukra and gave him the spell,
<>capable of destroying the devas. When he was about
<>to return Jayanti1 accepted him as her husband. Be-
<>cause of his familiarity with her, of a long standing,
<>he could not refuse her request. S4ukra told her that
<>he would become her husband, for a period of ten
<>years and that during that period both of them would
<>be invisible to the world. Thus the couple began an
<>invisible life.
<NI>Br2haspati thought of making the best use of this period.
<>He personated himself as S4ukra1ca1rya and went to the
<>Asuras, who thinking that their teacher had returned
<>after a long penance gave him a loving and sincere
<>welcome. Br2haspati sat on the seat of S4ukra1ca1rya and
<>began to exhort the asuras in such a manner that [Page163-b+ 64]
<>within the period of ten years he was able to remove
<>factionalism and hatred from them.
<NI>At the expiry of ten years' invisible life S4ukra returned
<>having sent Jayanti1 away. The asuras saw two S4ukras
<>together and were amazed. They declared that the
<>real S4ukra was he who had been teaching them for the
<>last ten years. Being dismayed at the ingratitude of the
<>asuras he cursed them that they would shortly be
<>destroyed and then left the place. At this juncture
<>Br2haspati also assumed his real form and returned to
<>heaven. Thus the asuras became a people without a
<>leader like sheep without a shepherd. At last they
<>approached their teacher S4ukra who became their
<>teacher again, when they begged for his pardon. But
<>he said that his curse could not be recalled. But he
<>gave them absolution by saying that they would regain
<>their lost power during the time of Manu Sa1varn2i.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>7) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a was returning haugh-
<>ty and proud after having defeated the devas and con-
<>quered heaven, when Sulekha1 the daughter of Br2has-
<>pati, got terrified and ran away to hide herself from
<>him. Ra1van2a chased her and when she was caught he
<>tried to ravish her. Br2haspati got angry and cursed him.
<>“You, who have grown rank by the dart of Cupid,
<>will meet with death by the dart of Ra1ma”. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>8) {%Br2haspati and Hanu1ma1n.%} An5jana1 the mother of
<>Hanu1ma1n was a servant of Br2haspati in her previous
<>birth. Her name then was Pun5jika1sthali1. She once went
<>to fetch water. At that time many Vidya1dhara young
<>people, both male and female, came there and engaged
<>in amorous acts. Pun5jika1sthali1 witnessed these love
<>scenes for a long time and then returned home. It is
<>mentioned in Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a that Br2haspati
<>cursed her to be born in the next birth as a female
<>monkey.
<NI>An5jana1 gave birth to Hanu1ma1n. When he grew up
<>Hanu1ma1n desired to learn Vedas and S4a1stras (scrip-

<>him. But Br2haspati was not prepared to teach a monkey
<>who jumped about everywhere. The disappointed
<>Hanu1ma1n went to the Sun, who asked him how it
<>could be done by him as he was engaged in travelling
<>without stop. Hanu1ma1n said that he would move in
<>front of the sun always. Thus Hanu1ma1n who had been
<>rejected by Br2haspati became the disciple of the Sun.

<HI>BUDHA I. Son of Candra.
<NI>1) Birth. Br2haspati the teacher-priest of the devas
<>had a very beautiful wife named Ta1ra1. One day seeing
<>the handsome figure of Candra, Ta1ra1 became amorous.
<>Candra was the Disciple of Br2haspati. It was not right
<>on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous
<>towards a disciple. Br2haspati came to know of the
<>affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his
<>wife. Both Candra and Ta1ra1 did not pay any heed to
<>Br2haspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle.
<>The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing
<>that this was not an honourable thing some devas
<>tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Ta1ra1
<>to Br2haspati. At this time Ta1ra1 was pregnant. Both
<>Candra and Br2haspati claimed the paternity of the
<>child in the womb of Ta1ra1, who witnessed that Candra [Page165-a+ 65]
<>was the father of the child. All accepted the words of
<>Ta1ra1. Budha was the child Ta1ra1 gave birth to.

<HI>BUDHA IV. A Bra1hman2a who lived in Gaud2ades4a.
<>Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too
<>much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on
<>the veranda of the house of a harlot. His father became
<>anxious about him as he had not returned though the
<>night had advanced much. He searched everywhere
<>and finally came to the place where he was lying un-
<>conscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry
<>killed his father then and there.
<NI>After that he returned home. His mother advised him
<>to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him.
<>Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments
<>on his way, he put an end to their lives.
<NI>Once this Bra1hman2a carried away Sulabha1 the beauti-
<>ful wife of hermit Ka1labhu1ti and ravished her. Sulabha1
<>cursed him and made him a leper.
<NI>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King
<>S4u1rasena. On that day the King was about to go to
<>Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However
<>hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an
<>inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away
<>the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer
<>have made the plane stationary.”
<NI>S4u1rasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper
<>and cured him with catura1ks2ari1mantra (a spell of four
<>letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
<>(Gan2es4a Pura1n2a 1:76).
<HI>BUDDHA. The founder of Buddhism. Some consider
<>him to be an incarnation of Vis2n2u. In days of old in
<>a battle the devas were defeated by the asuras and the
<>gods approached Vis2n2u with their grievance. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u incarnated as the son of S4uddhodana with the [Page165-b+ 65]
<>name Gautamabuddha (Siddha1rtha). Then he went
<>to the asuras and made them reject the Vedas and the
<>laws thereof. All the Daityas (Asuras) became Bud-
<>dhists. There is a story in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 16,
<>that thus it was the purpose of Buddha to convert
<>every asura to Buddhism and send him to hell.
<NI>The story given above is in accordance with the Pura1-
<>n2as. The following are the facts gained by historic
<>investigations.
<NI>Gautama Buddha was born in B.C. 560, in Kapilavastu
<>near the Hima1layas. His father was S4uddhodana. He
<>was born in the family of the S4a1kyas. The word ‘S4a1kya’
<>is another form of the word Ks2atriya. The real name of
<>Buddha was Siddha1rtha. S4uddhodana brought up his
<>son in such a way that he should not be subjected to
<>any sort of mental pain or worry. So he kept Buddha
<>aloof from the outer world. Thus he spent his childhood
<>in comfort and pleasure. Once by chance he happened
<>to see a sick man, an old man and a dead body. The
<>sight made him thoughtful. He began to think upon
<>a way to remove sorrow and pain from the world and
<>to bring about peace and comfort.
<NI>The change that appeared in the son worried the
<>father. So at the age of sixteen he made Siddha1rtha
<>marry Yas4odhara1. A son was born to them. But the
<>mind of Siddha1rtha was restless, distressed and agi-
<>tated. One day Siddha1rtha discarded everything and
<>went out of the palace alone.
<NI>Siddha1rtha wandered from place to place learning
<>from various teachers. But he did not find peace.
<>Once on a full-moon day while he was sitting in medi-
<>tation under a banian tree he got ‘Bodha’. (insight or
<>conviction). From that day onwards he began to be
<>known by the name ‘Buddha’. After that he came to
<>Ka1s4i, and told his disciples how he got Bodha or con-
<>viction. The number of his followers increased day by
<>day. Thus Buddhism came into being. Buddha said
<>that the reason for pain and sorrow in the world was
<>desire and that sorrow could be exterminated only
<>by controlling and overcoming all desire. To attain
<>Eternal Bliss one should be true and righteous in
<>thought, deed and word and that ‘Not Killing’ was
<>the foundation of righteousness. Buddhism spread
<>everywhere in Bha1rata.
<NI>Gautama Buddha died at the age of eighty.
<HI>BUDDHAGHOS2A. An ancient Sanskrit poet. It is be-
<>lieved that he lived in the 4th century A.D. The
<>most important work of this poet who was a Buddhist,
<>is ‘Padyacu1d2a1man2i’. The life of Buddha is described
<>in this Book in ten Ka1n2d2as (sections). A similarity to
<>the poems of Ka1lida1sa and As4vaghos2a is seen in this
<>poem. Buddhaghos2a is said to have reached Ceylon
<>in 357 A.D. and translated some Buddhist literature.
<HI>BUDDHI. A wife of Dharmadeva. In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7, it is mentioned that Dharmadeva
<>had married thirteen daughters of Daks2a. They are
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,
<>Buddhi, Lajja1, Vapus, S4a1nti, Siddhi1 and Ki1rti.
<HI>BUDDHIKA1MA. An attendant of S4ubrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>Salya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 12).
<HI>BUDDHISM. (BUDDHA-MATA). The origin of Bud-
<>dhism was in the sixth century B.C. This new religion
<>was shaped out of Hinduism that prevailed at that
<>time. Buddhism which had its origin in North India,
<>prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh [Page166-a+ 65]
<>century A.D. During that period there was an over-
<>flow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now
<>this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma.
<>90% of the population there, are adherents of Bud-
<>dhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the
<>people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are
<>now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines
<>the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indo-
<>nesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of
<>Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are consi-
<>dered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are
<>only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In count-
<>ries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism.
<>Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixty-
<>five thousand Buddhists in North America, one
<>hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America,
<>and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists
<>in the world today is 150.31 crores.

<>days once with his wives Ma1dri1 and Kunti1. (S4loka 48,
<>Chapter 118, A1di Parva).
<NI>As a support to the great mountain Maha1meru were
<>four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supa1rs4va
<>and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood,
<>Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhra1jaka and Sarvatobhadra.
<>Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on
<>Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pan5cama Skandha,

<HI>CAKAT2A. (See Brahmadatta II).
<HI>CAKRA I. A son of Va1suki, the Na1ga king. He died at

<HI>CAKRA(M3) I. Sudars4ana Cakra (disc) of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a contains the following story about
<>the origin of the Cakra.
<NI>Su1ryadeva (the Sun God) married Sam3jn5a1, daughter
<>of Vis4vakarma1. But, due to the insufferable heat of
<>her husband the marital life of Sam3jn5a1 became miser- [Page166-b+ 65]
<>able, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat
<>of Su1rya. And, accordingly Vis4vakarma1 ground Su1rya
<>on a grinding machine and thus diminished his efful-
<>gence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of
<>that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the
<>earth, and with that Vis4vakarma1 made the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra, the Tris4u1la, the Pus2pakavima1na and the
<>weapon called S4akti. Out of those four things the
<>Tris4u1la came to be possessed by S4iva, the Pus2paka-
<>vima1na by Kubera and S4akti by Brahma1. The Sudar-
<>s4ana Cakra which was glowing like anything was
<>deposited in the sea. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata as to how the
<>Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna were picnic-
<>ing on the shores of the Yamuna1 Agnideva went to
<>them and requested them to give Kha1n2d2ava forest to
<>him for food. As Taks2aka, friend of Indra, was living
<>in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall
<>there. Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni
<>would be able to consume the forest only after subjuga-
<>ting Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said
<>that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with,
<>and accordingly he meditated on Varun2a, who pre-
<>sented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey
<>as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty
<>of arrows, a bow called Ga1n2d2i1va and the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the
<>other things to Arjuna. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>297).
<HI>CAKRA(M3) II. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma

<>trapped and killed. (Abhimanyu, who forced himself
<>inside the Vyu1ha did not know the method of get-
<>ing out of it which Arjuna alone knew). Cakravyu1ha is
<>made in the form and shape of Cart-wheels. Vya1sa has
<>described the Cakravyu1ha made by Dron2a as follows:--
<>The great preceptor made the Cakravyu1ha and posted
<>in it to maximum capacity kings, who were equal to
<>Indra. In every opening of the vyu1ha were posted
<>princes equal in prowess to the Sun. All the princes
<>were organised compactly. And, all of them wore red
<>uniforms and were adorned with other things also red
<>in colour and held red flags. They also wore golden
<>ornaments and garlands scented with Sandal paste.
<>Ten thousand strong they rushed forward to fight with
<>Abhimanyu. Duryodhana's son, Laks2man2a, led the

<>stood Dron2a, the captain of the army, who looked like
<>the rising sun. Then there was the King of Sindhu,
<>and near him stood As4vattha1ma1, and there stood in
<>front of them thirty Kauravas, all of them equal to
<>Devas. On the flanks were great heroes like S4alya,
<>Bhu1ris4ravas. And then did the battle rage. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 34).

<>fruits, (edible) roots etc. But, he did so only after
<>himself tasting them. One day while thus tasting a
<>fruit, somehow or other it got itself lodged in his
<>throat, and all his attempts to dislodge it failed. The
<>fruit had to be, at any rate, offered to Vis2n2u and there-
<>fore Cakrika drew his sword and cut his throat with it.
<>Lord Vis2n2u who was so pleased at such great devotion
<>of the man appeared on the scene and brought him
<>back to life. Sometime afterwards Cakrika expired at
<>the Dva1raka1 temple, and thus attained salvation.
<HI>CAKRODDHATA. A king in the dynasty of Yaya1ti.
<>(Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US I. A synonym of the Sun. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>1, Verse 42).
<HI>CAKS2US II. A tributary of river Gan3ga1. Starting from
<>Vis2n2upa1da (Svarga) the Gan3ga1 falls into Devaya1na
<>and thence into the moon and after flooding the whole
<>area it divides itself into four tributaries, viz., Si1ta1,
<>Caks2us, Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and falls into Brahma-
<>loka and flows in four directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries the river called Caks2us falls on the peak of Mount
<>Ma1lyava1n and then flows through Ketuma1la and falls
<>into the western sea. The Gan3ga1 which flows through
<>India is a branch of the above-mentioned tributary,
<>Alakananda1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US III. A king born in the lunar dynasty. He
<>was the son of King Anudruhyu. (Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2URVARDHANIKA1. A river which flows through
<>S4a1kadvi1pa. (S4a1ka island). (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Verse 33).
<HI>CA1KS2US2AMANU.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The sixth of the fourteen Manus. (See
<>Manvantara). [Page167-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Genealogy.%} Utta1napa1da and Priyavrata were the
<>sons of Sva1yambhuvamanu, and Dhruva was Utta1na-
<>pa1da's son. Dhruva had two sons, S4is2t2i, and Bhavya
<>by his wife S4ambhu. Sucha1ya1, wife of S4is2t2i, had five
<>sons, viz., Ripu, Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2kate-
<>jas. From Br2hati1, wife of Ripu, was born Ca1ks2us2a, the
<>mighty and Ca1ks2us2a begot a son called Manu by
<>Pus2karan2i1, daughter of Vi1ran2apraja1pati and one of the
<>offsprings of Varun2a. This Manu was called Ca1ks2us2a
<>Manu. And Ca1ks2us2a Manu had ten sons by his wife
<>Nadvala1, daughter of Vaira1japraja1pati, called Kuru,
<>Puru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agni-
<>s2t2oma, Atira1tra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Out of
<>the ten, Puru had the following sons by A1gneyi1, viz.
<>An3ga, Sumanas, Khya1ti, Kratu, An3giras and S4ibi.
<>An3ga married Suni1tha1, and Vena was their son. The
<>famous emperor, Pr2thu was Vena's son.
<NI>3) {%Former life.%} The following story is told in the
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a about the former life of Ca1ks2us2a
<>before he was born as Ca1ks2us2a. In that former life he
<>was A1nanda, son of Anamitra. Once a cat carried
<>A1nanda away and laid him on the bed of the child of
<>King Vikra1nta, and the same cat deposited the king's
<>child somewhere else. And, A1nanda grew up as the
<>real son of the King. But, one day he told the King
<>the truth about him and left for the forest for tapas.
<>Brahma1 appeared before him and blessed that he
<>would, in the next birth, be born as the sixth Manu
<>and thus Ca1ks2us2a became the sixth Manu.
<NI>4) {%Chief incidents during his time.%} During Ca1ks2us2aman-
<>vantara were born the famous Nara and Na1ra1yan2a as
<>the sons of Dharma. It was also during this period that
<>Brahma1 was born as Candra, Vis2n2u as Datta1treya and
<>S4iva as Durva1sas from Anasu1ya1, the purest of women
<>and the wife of Atri. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Caturtha
<>Skandha).
<HI>CA1KS2US2I1. An art, the study of which will enable one
<>to see anything in the three worlds. Ca1ks2us2i1 was
<>taught by Manu to Soma, by him to Vis4va1vasu, by
<>him to Citraratha, the Gandharva and by him to
<>Arjuna, son of Pa1n2d2u. (A1di Parva).
<HI>CA1KYA1RKU1TTU. A very important art practised in
<>temples mainly in Kerala. It is called so because it is
<>exhibited by Ca1kya1rs (a sect attached to temples). In
<>important temples a place called Ku1ttambala is set
<>apart for displaying the art. The Ku1ttu now prevalent
<>in Kerala temples is not exactly of its old form. Kula-
<>s4ekharavarma1 peruma1l (elected ruler of old Kerala)
<>effected some changes in the old art form, and Bha1skara-
<>ravivarma1 peruma1l and Tolakavi made further reforms
<>in it. The art of Ku1ttu was evolved with the object of
<>relating pura1n2ic stories in such a manner as will help
<>devotional feelings grow in man.
<NI>The main aim of the Ku1ttu is to narrate pura1n2ic
<>stories in such a way as to instil Bhakti in the hearers
<>and to create an interest in them in the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ca1kya1r (the man who gives the discourse who usually
<>belongs to the Brahmin sect called Ca1kya1rs) tells the
<>story in a very interesting way, reciting appropriate
<>passages from the Pura1n2as and illustrating them with
<>apt examples and similes. The narration is from the
<>beginning till end humorous. The Ca1kya1r who delivers
<>the discourse is usually a man with a good sense of
<>humour and a sense of what is odd, strange or eccentric
<>in nature and human character. There are three varie- [Page168-a+ 65]
<>ties of Ku1ttu: Prabandham3 Ku1ttu, Nam3biar Ku1ttu and
<>Ku1t2ia1t2t2am. Of these the first is narrative (A1khya1na-
<>para) while in the second and third type, the element
<>of acting is more important (Abhinayapara).
<HI>CALA1. Laks2mi1devi1. The following story is told in the
<>Devi1-bha1gavata as to how this name came to be
<>applied to the devi1. Once Revanta the very handsome
<>son of Su1ryadeva came to Vaikun2t2ha riding Uccaih2-
<>s4ravas, Indra's horse. Devi1, who was at that time with
<>Vis2n2u gazed for a few minutes in wonder at the horse.
<>She did not, therefore, attend to Vis2n2u's talk. Angered
<>at this Vis2n2u told the devi1: “Since your eyes find
<>enjoyment on unnecessary things and move about
<>among such objects, you shall be called from today
<>onwards Rama1 and Cala1. Also you will be born as a
<>mare on earth. Accordingly Maha1laks2mi1 was born as
<>a mare on the banks of river Sarasvati1, and regained
<>her old form only after delivering a son by Vis2n2u. That
<>son was Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya kingdom. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 6).
<HI>CAMARA. (CAMARI1). An animal whose tail is its most
<>important and valued organ. In the course of its move-
<>ments in the forest if the tail gets entangled anywhere
<>it is supposed to lie down there till the tail is freed by
<>itself. About the origin of Camara, the following story
<>is told in the Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. Krodhavas4a1, daughter
<>of Daks2apraja1pati and wife of Kas4yapa had ten daugh-
<>ters, viz. Mr2gi1, Mr2gamada1, Hari, Bhadramada1,
<>Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, S4veti1, Surasa1, Surabhi and Kadru1.
<>To Mr2gamada1 the Sr2maras and Camaras owe their
<>origin. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>CA1MARA(M). A rod (handle) with a large tuft of
<>hair, fibre or feathers at the end. A symbol used by
<>kings and brahmins. Ca1mara of the king should have a
<>golden handle, and it should be made of the wings of
<>the swan, the pea cock, the Bala1ka1 bird etc. But, the
<>wings of different birds shall not be intermixed. Circu-
<>lar in shape, the Ca1mara should have on its handle
<>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 sandhis (joints, knots). (Agni-
<>pura1n2a, Chapter 245).
<HI>CAMASA. A yogi, the younger brother of Bharata, a king
<>born in the dynasty of Priyavrata, son of Manu. This
<>country got its name Bha1rata from king Bharata (country
<>ruled by Bharata). Bharata had nine brothers called
<>Kus4a1varta, Ila1varta, Brahma1varta, A1rya1varta, Malaya,
<>Bhadraketu, Sena, Indraspr2k and Ki1kat2a. Bharata had
<>also nine other brothers renowned as navayogi1s, born
<>of another mother. Camasa was one of them, the other
<>eight being Kavi, Hari, Ambari1s2a, Prabuddha, Pippa-
<>la1yana, A1vi1rhotra, Dramid2a and Kharabha1jana. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAMASODBHEDA. A holy place in Saura1s2t2ra which
<>forms part of the very reputed sacred place called
<>Vina1s4ana. It is said that it was here that the river
<>Sarasvati1 which once became invisible, was detected. A
<>bath here is as efficacious as performing the Jyotis2t2oma
<>yajn5a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 112).
<HI>CAMATKA1RA. (See PATTU).
<HI>CAMOHARA. A vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva.
<>Chapter 191, Verse 35).
<HI>CAMPA. A king born in the An3ga dynasty. (See
<>CANDRAVAM3S4A).
<HI>CAM3PA1. (CAM3PA1PURI1). A city on the banks of river
<>Gan3ga1, Cam3pa1 is often referred to in the Pura1n2as4. It
<>was here that Lomapa1da lived in treta1yuga. (M.B. [Page168-b+ 64]
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 113, Verse 15). In Dva1parayuga
<>the city was ruled by a Su1ta called Atiratha, who got
<>Karn2a, while he and his wife were brooding over their
<>lack of a child. In after years Karn2a also ruled the
<>city. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 7).
<HI>CAM3PAKA. A vidya1dhara. Once he visited the banks
<>of river Yamuna1 with his wife Mada1lasa1 when they got
<>from the forest nearby a child. The child in later years
<>became famous as Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya
<>dynasty. (See EKAVI1RA).
<HI>CAMPAKA1RAN2YA. (CAMPA1KARA). A holy place
<>in Northern India. One day's halt at the place and a
<>bath there is considered to be as good as giving away
<>one thousand cows as gift. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 84).
<HI>CA1MPEYA. Son of Vis4va1mitra who was a brahmava1din
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 58).
<HI>CAMPU1. A literary form of presenting a story in a
<>mixture of prose and verse, and abounding in beauti-
<>ful descriptions: “Gadyapadyamayam3 ka1vyam3 Cam-
<>pu1rityabhidhi1yate”. Over and above prose and verse
<>the Campu1s use dan2d2akas (very long, involved and
<>poetical prose). This literary form had its origin
<>first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it
<>with some variations. For instance, though prose in
<>Sanskrit Campu1s is really prose, that in Malayalam
<>is something akin to metrical prose. There are more
<>than two hundred Campu1s in Malayalam. The most
<>famous of the Campu1 writers in Malaya1lam are
<>Punam Namboothiri, Maha1man3galam Namboothiri
<>and Ni1lakan2t2ha.
<HI>CAMU1. A division of an army. (See Aksauhin2i1)
<HI>CA1MUN2D2A1. (See Pa1rvati1).
<HI>CA1N2AKA. The auspiciousness of Ca1n2aka (cowdung) is
<>due to Laks2mi1. (See Laks2mi1, Paras 1 and 6).
<HI>CA1N2AKYA (KAUT2ILYA). The famous author of
<>“Arthas4a1stra” a treatise on political economy.
<NI>Eastern and western scholars have made exhaustive
<>researches on this intellectual giant of ancient India,
<>Ca1n2akya. But, nothing definite has yet been established
<>about his time or life. Indians have accepted as a fact
<>the traditional legend that he was a minister of Candra-
<>gupta, the founder of the Maurya dynasty. It is also
<>firmly believed that it was this mighty intellect of a
<>brahmin who made Candragupta a powerful emperor
<>and steered the ship of his state. The phrase ‘Ca1n2akya's
<>kut2ilani1ti’ (crooked tactics) has become proverbial.
<>Some scholars hold the opinion that he came to be
<>called ‘Kaut2ilya’ because of his Kut2ila (crooked)
<>tactics; but evidence to establish this view-point is yet
<>to be adduced.
<NI>It is his famous Arthas4a1stra, which has made Ca1n2akya's
<>name a world famous one. The great German thinker
<>Jolly has described the Arthas4a1stra as a unique composi-
<>tion in the Sanskrit language. And, Johann Meyer, the
<>great western scholar has the following to say about
<>the book:--
<NI>“Kaut2ilya's Arthas4a1stra is not one single text, it is a
<>collection and collateration of all books in ancient
<>India. To study the greatness of the theories and
<>principles contained in it today requires continuous and
<>constant study at least for twenty years and the un-
<>remitting efforts of a scholar with unabounded know-
<>ledge are required.” [Page169-a+ 65]
<>Even his name has not yet been confirmed beyond
<>doubts. Kaut2ilya is also called Vis2n2ugupta, Ca1n2akya,
<>Dramila, and An3gula. Modern researches place the
<>date of the Arthas4a1stra at near about B.C. 400. In
<>Vis4a1khadatta's Mudra1ra1ksasa (drama) the name
<>Kaut2ilya is used.
<NI>The Authors of Ni1tis4a1stra maintain that the name of
<>the author of Arthas4a1stra was Vis2n2ugupta. It may be
<>gathered from the Mudra1ra1ks2asa that he became famous
<>as Ca1n2akya as he was the son of Can2aka, and that
<>he possessed deep erudition in Ni1tis4a1stra, Dharma-
<>s4a1stra and astrology. There is another legend to the
<>effect that this brahmin (Ca1n2akya) belonged to Ka1n5ci1-
<>pura and that he migrated to Pa1t2ali1putra, the seat of
<>learning and scholarship. As Ka1mandaka, who lived
<>in the fourth century B.C. has eulogised Ca1n2akya in
<>his ni1tis4a1stra it may be surmised that Ca1n2akya lived
<>sometime near about that. Candragupta and Ca1n2akya
<>are referred to in the Vis2n2u and the Va1mana Pura1n2as.
<>Kaut2ilya was keen-eyed and scholar par excellence.
<>“Arthas4a1stra” is a great book written by him after
<>thoroughly examining the viewpoints of previous
<>scholars, and then establishing his own views and
<>theories. From the Das4akuma1racarita of Dan2d2i1 (A.D.
<>700) it may be seen that there are 6000 verses in the
<>Anus2t2up metre (eight letters in one line) in the Artha-
<>s4a1stra composed by Vis2n2ugupta for the use of Candra-
<>gupta Maurya. The Artha a1stra has been held in praise
<>by Ba1n2abhat2t2a who lived in the 7th Century, Soma-
<>devasu1ri, who lived in the 10th century and also by
<>Hemacandra, the author of Ka1vya1nus4a1sana, who lived
<>in the 12th century. The book is a discourse on the
<>principles and practices that are necessary to establish
<>a strong government of an ideal empire. Ca1n2akya has
<>mentioned in his book with respect the old scholars like
<>Manu, S4ukra, Br2haspati, Na1ra1yan2a, Ka1tya1yana and
<>Govinda di1ks2ita. (For the pura1n2ic story about Ca1n2akya
<>see Vararuci, Para 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1. A notorious harlot who lived in dva1-
<>para yuga. When one day at midnight she came to the
<>appointed place to meet a paramour the latter had not
<>arrived. While waiting impatiently there she was
<>attacked and killed by a leopard. Emissaries of Vis2n2u
<>as also of Yama arrived to carry away the soul of
<>Can5cala1ks2i1. Yama's men argued that she had sinned
<>throughout her life, and therefore claimed the harlot's
<>soul. But the emissaries of Visn2u countered the argu-
<>ment thus: “once on her way to conduct her trade
<>Can5cala1ks2i1 got into a temple and munched ta1mbu1la in
<>the course of which she rubbed some lime on the walls
<>of the temple. Taking into consideration this fact of
<>her having spent sometime thus to clean the temple
<>wall her soul deserves to be led to Vis2n2uloka”.
<NI>In the argument the emissaries of Yama were defeated
<>and the soul of Can5cala1ks2i1 was taken to Vaikun2t2ha by
<>the emissaries of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1 II. A vidya1dhara girl. Once while she
<>was concentrating her mind in prayer over Maha1laksmi1,
<>Ra1van2a, King of the Ra1ks2asas, committed rape on her,
<>and she cursed him that he should die on account of
<>Maha1laks2mi1 herself and accordingly at last he was
<>killed by Ra1ma on account of Si1ta1, the incarnation of
<>Maha1laks2mi1. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CAN2D2A. (See Can2d2amun2d2a1s).
<HI>CAN2D2ABALA. A prominent monkey. In the Ra1ma- [Page169-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a war this monkey caused much trouble to Kum-
<>bhakarn2a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 287, Verse 6).
<HI>CAN2D2ABHA1RGAVA. A mahars2i born in the dynasty
<>of Cyavana Muni. A very erudite scholar and deeply
<>versed in the Vedas, it was this mahars2i, who performed
<>Janamejaya's famous Sarpa sattra. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 58, Verse 4).
<HI>CAN2D2AKA. A forest hunter who attained salvation by
<>the worship of S4ivalin3ga. (Phallus of S4iva).
<NI>While once hunting in the woods Can2d2aka saw a S4iva
<>temple in ruins, and the S4ivalin3ga lying on the ground
<>uncared for. This sight greatly grieved him, and he
<>told S4im3haketu, son of the Pa1n5ca1la Ra1ja who happened
<>to come that way all about the temple and the
<>lin3ga. To his query as to whether the s4a1stra permitted
<>a hunter like himself to worship S4ivalin3ga, Sim3haketu
<>answered there were injunctions in the S4a1stras for
<>people like him (Can2d2akas) to instal S4ivalin3ga on
<>rock and then worship it daily, the worshipper wear-
<>ing ashes from the burning gha1t2 on his body. Accord-
<>ingly Can2d2aka installed the lin3ga on a rock and began
<>worshipping it daily along with his wife, Pulindi1. But
<>after sometime there was left no ashes in the burning
<>gha1t2 and Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 discussed between them
<>the means to get ashes for the next day. Then Pulindi1
<>suggested that she should burn herself to ashes and that
<>Can2d2aka should continue worshipping the S4ivalin3ga
<>wearing on his body the ashes. Very unwillingly
<>Can2d2aka agreed with the sad proposal of his wife, and
<>the next day he worshipped the S4ivalin3ga wearing on
<>his body the ashes of Pulindi1. And, at the close of the
<>worship he called aloud for Pulindi1, and lo! wonder
<>of wonders! she stood there before him more healthy
<>than formerly. Moreover a vima1na descended from the
<>skies and conducted both Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 to
<>S4ivaloka. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4am3barama1ha1tyma).
<HI>CAN2D2AKAUS4IKA. A muni, son of Kaks4iva1n, the son of
<>Gautama. Br2hadratha, King of Magadha, was having no
<>issues when, one day, Can2d2akaus4ika went to the palace
<>and blessed the King as a result of which a son called
<>Jara1sandha was born to him. Can2d2akaus4ika continued to
<>live at Magadha for long as the preceptor of the kings of
<>that land. (See Jara1sandha).
<HI>CAN2D2A1LA. (See Ca1turvarn2ya).
<HI>CAN2D2AMAHA1SENA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A very prominent and reputed king of
<>Ujjayini. Va1savadatta1, wife of Udayana was his
<>daughter.
<NI>2) {%The name Can2d2amaha1sena.%} His real name was Maha1-
<>sena. After ascending the throne he began doing
<>tapas to get a noble wife and a good sword. When he
<>cut his own flesh and made an offering of the same to
<>the sacred fire after a long period of tapas the Devi1
<>became pleased, and offered him a sword of exceptional
<>excellence and said that as long as he had that sword
<>with him no enemy would defeat him. The Devi1 also
<>assured him that ere long An3ga1ravati1, daughter of the
<>asura called An3ga1raka and the fairest damsel in the
<>three worlds would become his wife. Since he (Maha1-
<>sena) did the most austere rites and rituals, the Devi1
<>said, he would come to be called Can2d2amaha1sena.
<>Afterwards the sword given by the Devi1 and the ele-
<>phant called nad2a1giri proved as successful and effective
<>to him as were Vajra1yudha and his elephant Aira1vata
<>to Indra. [Page170-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} One day, during a hunting expedition
<>a boar escaped unhurt by the king's arrows and after
<>turning turtle his chariot it went into a cave. The king
<>in great anger followed the pig into the cave, and going
<>forward some distance he saw a beautiful animal where-
<>upon he seated himself on the side of a tank. There he
<>saw, amidst a number of women an exceptionally
<>beautiful woman moving about. Casting her charming
<>eyes glistering with love the woman approached the
<>King. During their conversation, when the king told
<>her about himself she began crying. To the query as
<>to the reason for her crying she answered as follows:--
<>“The boar you saw is my father, An3ga1raka1sura. His
<>body is harder than even diamond, and none can inflict
<>any injury on it. The women you see around are
<>princesses captured by my father from various palaces
<>for my help, and my name is An3ga1ravati1. My father
<>became a Ra1ks2asa as the result of a curse; he is now
<>asleep in the assumed form of a boar. On awaking he
<>is sure to eat you for food, and it was that thought which
<>brought tears to my eyes”. To these words of An3ga1ra-
<>vati1, the king replied as follows:--“If you have any
<>love for me you would go to your father and begin
<>crying when he wakes up, and to his question as to
<>why you are crying you should reply that thoughts
<>about your future in the event of your fathers's death
<>brought tears in your eyes.”
<NI>An3ga1ravati1 agreed to the above proposal of the King.
<>She hid the King in a safe place and went and stood
<>by the side of her father. Everything happened as was
<>anticipated and An3ga1raka consoled his daughter by
<>saying that none would be able to kill him whose
<>body was as hard and strong as diamond, there being
<>only one opening through which he might be struck on
<>the left wrist which might be concealed by the bow.
<>Can2d2amaha1sena who heard the above talk came out of
<>his hiding place and challenged the asura to war. He
<>raised his left hand to show the sign, “just coming,
<>please wait”, and the king then shot his arrow through
<>the opening on his left wrist. The asura fell dead.
<NI>4) {%Birth of Va1savadatta1:%} And, now Can2d2amaha1sena
<>married An3ga1ravati1 and returned to his kingdom with
<>his wife. Two sons, Gopa1laka and Pa1laka were born to
<>the royal couple, and the King celebrated an Indro-
<>tsava for the welfare and prosperity of the children.
<>Pleased at the utsava Indra appeared to the king in
<>sleep and blessed him saying that a daughter would be
<>born to him and that her son would be crowned empe-
<>ror of the Vidya1dharas. Accordingly a daughter was
<>born to the King, and she was called Va1savadatta1.
<>(given by Va1sava, i.e. Indra). Udayana married Va1sava-
<>datta1. (See Udayana).
<HI>CAN2D2AMUN2D2AS. Two brothers born in the Asura
<>dynasty, the elder brother being called Can2d2a and
<>the younger Mun2d2a. These brothers collected, like
<>the other asura leaders Dhu1mra1ks2a, and Raktabi1ja,
<>thousands of soldiers and lived in all pomp and
<>glory.
<NI>During this period two asura brothers called S4umbha
<>and Nis4umbha had returned from the Hima1layas after
<>securing from Brahman a boon that they would meet
<>with their death only at the hands of a woman. Can2d2a
<>and Mun2d2a became their friends and attendants.
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha set out on a triumphal tour
<>and conquered heaven, earth and pa1ta1la. The Devas [Page170-b+ 65]
<>took refuge in a forest. After wandering in the forest
<>for a long time, at the instance of Br2haspati they sought
<>asylum with Pa1rvati1. Pa1rvati1 stood for sometime in deep
<>concentration, and there emerged from her divine body
<>Kaus2iki1 or Ka1li1. Pa1rvati1 assured the Devas that she
<>would kill S4umbha and Nis4umbha. And, then Ka1li1 sat
<>alone on a rock in the thick Forest. Can2d2a and Mun2d2a,
<>who happened to pass that way were attracted by the
<>great beauty of Pa1rvati1 and imparted the news to
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha, and they deputed Dhu1mra1ks2a
<>and 60,000 soldiers to bring Pa1rvati1 over to them; but
<>by one hum3ka1ra (sound ‘hum’) she reduced them to
<>ashes. Ultimately she killed S4umbha and Nis4umbha
<>also. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAN2D2ATUN2D2AKA(S). A son of Garuda. (Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 9).
<HI>CAN2D2AVEGA. A gandharva. (See Puran5jana).
<HI>CAN2D2IKA1. A terrific form of Pa1rvati1, who is worship-
<>ped in temples under the name Can2d2ika1devi1. The
<>Devi1's idol has twenty hands. In the hands on the right
<>side are held S4u1la (three-pronged weapons) sword,
<>Vela (rod), Cakra, pa1s4a (rope), parigha (shield),
<>a1yudha, abhaya, d2amaru and S4akti, while the hands
<>on the left side hold na1gapa1s4a, small parigha, axe,
<>An3kus4a (a long-hooked rod), pa1s4a, man2i, flag, gada1,
<>mirror and an iron cylindrical rod. There are also
<>idols of Can2d2ika1 with ten hands. At the feet of the
<>Devi1 lies Mahis2a1sura with his head severed from body.
<>There will also be standing near the idol a purus2a (man)
<>born from the neck of the Ma1his2a brandishing his wea-
<>pon, and with the S4u1la in his hand in all rage and
<>womitting blood and with red hairs and eyes. That
<>purus2a is bound strongly on his neck with rope. The
<>vehicle of the Devi1 is a lion. The Devi1 is mounted on
<>the lion with her left leg on the asura lying below. This
<>Can2d2ika1devi1 thus stands with weapons in the hand, as
<>annihilator of enemies and with three eyes, and she
<>should be worshipped in pu1ja1man2d2ala with nine Padmas
<>(tantric divisions) along with her idol. Firstly the Devi1
<>should be worshipped in the central padma and Indra
<>and others in the other padmas.
<NI>There is also another Can2d2ika1devi1 (Durga1) with eigh-
<>teen hands. She holds in her right hand a skull, shield,
<>mirror, broom, bow, flag, d2amaru and pa1s4a (cord) and
<>in her left hand rod, iron pounder, S4u1la, Vajra, sword,
<>An3kus4a (a sticklike weapon with one end bent to hold
<>on to things) S4ara (arrow) Cakra and s4ala1ka1. There
<>are nine other Durga1s having the same weapons as the
<>above except the D2amaru and the broom. But, they
<>have only sixteen hands each. These nine Durga1s are
<>called Rudracan2d2a1, Pracan2d2a1, Ugracan2d2a1, Can2d2a1-
<>na1yika1, Atican2d2ika1, and Can2d2ogra1. The Durga1 standing
<>at the centre will have the colour of gorocana (red
<>sandal paste) and the others will have the following
<>colours; arun2avarn2a (red) Kr2s2n2a varn2a (black), ni1la
<>varn2a (blue), s4ukla varn2a (white), dhu1mra varn2a
<>(brown) pi1ta varn2a (yellow) and s4vet2a varn2a (white).
<>The nava Durga1s (nine Durga1s) are installed for the
<>prosperity of children etc. And all these are different
<>forms of Pa1rvati1.
<NI>Also, in various aspects or poses, Pa1rvati1 is called by
<>other names. She is called Siddha1 when installed in
<>Ram3bha1-vana wearing aks2ama1la1 (garland of beads),
<>kiri1t2a (crown) and agni. The same Siddha1 without
<>the fire is called Lalita1. Gauri1devi1 with one of the [Page171-a+ 65]
<>hands on the left side placed on the shoulder and the
<>head, and holding the mirror in the other hand, and
<>holding in one of the hands on the right side fruits etc.
<>and the other hand held up is called Saubha1gya gauri1.
<>(For further details see Pa1rvati1). (Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 50).
<HI>CANDRA I. A prominent asura, also called Candra-
<>varman. It was this asura, as beautiful as Candra (the
<>moon) who was born as the king of Ka1mboja under
<>the name Candravarman (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>67, Verse 31).
<HI>CANDRA II. A king born in the Solar dynasty and the
<>son of Vis4varandhi and father of Yuvana1s4va. See
<>Vam3s4a1vali1)
<HI>CANDRA III. The Pura1n2as declare that Candra was
<>one of the invaluable things got at the churning of
<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi (ocean of milk) Candra, Maha1laks2mi1, Sura1,
<>Uccaih2s4ravas, Kaustubha, Pa1rija1ta, Ka1madhenu,
<>Dhanvantari, Amr2tam and Ka1laku1t2a were the things
<>thus got from the Ocean of Milk. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 18 and Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 9). Also,
<>the evil devata1 called Jyes2t2ha1, Aira1vata, the gem
<>named Cinta1man2i and fair damsels like Ta1ra1 and Ruma1
<>were got from the Ks2i1ra1bdhi, (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a). For general information about Candra,
<>see Grahas).
<HI>CANDRA IV. (CANDRA DEVA).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The child born to Atri by Anasuya1. (See
<>Puru1ravas). In Skandha 4 of the Devi1bha1gavata it is
<>stated that it was Brahman who was born as Candra.
<>(See Atri).
<NI>2) {%Candra led married life with the wife of his guru.%} Ta1ra1,
<>the very beautiful wife of Br2haspati, preceptor of the
<>Devas happened to reach Candra's home during her
<>perambulation one day. Candra and Ta1ra1 fell in love
<>with each other at first sight and lived in conjugal
<>happiness. And thus days passed by. Br2haspati, being
<>informed of the fact on enquiry, deputed his disciples
<>to bring Ta1ra1 back, but to no purpose. Br2haspati sent
<>his disciples again and again to Ta1ra1, but all to no
<>purpose. Then Br2haspati himself went to the house of
<>Candra and invited Ta1ra1, this time also to no purpose.
<>Enraged at this the Deva guru spoke to Candra as
<>follows: “The brahmin-killer, gold-thief, drunkard, he
<>who marries another's wife and he who associates him-
<>self with the above three types are responsible for the
<>most terrible five sins, and you, therefore, are not fit
<>enough to reside in Devaloka. Unless you return my
<>wife to me I will curse you.” None of the threats of
<>Br2haspati could shake Candra. He told the Devaguru
<>that Ta1ra1 who had gone to his house on her own accord
<>would also leave him when she was satiated with him.
<>These words of Candra made Br2haspati all the more
<>angry. He returned home and waited sometime more
<>for Ta1ra1's return. But, he got disappointed, and getting
<>impatient he started again for Candra's house. But,
<>this time the gatekeepers did not let him in.
<NI>Terribly angry at the cruel rebuff Br2haspati sought
<>help of Indra. Indra sent word to Candra asking him
<>to send Ta1ra1 back home or be prepared for war. Even
<>then Candra refused to yield, and Indra started for
<>war against Candra. But, there was somehow some dif-
<>ference among the devas about all this, and the news
<>reached the asuras. At once S4ukra, preceptor of the
<>asuras and an old enemy of Br2haspati met Candra and [Page171-b+ 65]
<>assured him all support in case war broke out between
<>Indra and Candra. He also strongly advised Candra
<>not to return Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati. And, ultimately a
<>fierce war began between Indra and Candra. All acti-
<>vities in the world were thrown into confusion and
<>chaos. At this Brahma1 on his ham3sa (swan) came to
<>the scene and admonished Candra and S4ukra. They
<>could not but obey Brahma1 and so were forced to stop
<>fighting. Moreover, Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2has-
<>pati.
<NI>The quarrel and fighting thus ended for the time
<>being, but another problem cropped up. At the time
<>Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati she was carrying,
<>and Br2haspati was not aware of the fact. And at last
<>Ta1ra1 delivered an exceptionally beautiful male child.
<>The naming ceremony of the child was duly performed,
<>Br2haspati himself acting as its father. When the news
<>reached Candra he sent a messenger to Br2haspati
<>claiming the child was his. Br2haspati too claimed its
<>fatherhood. This controversy developed almost to the
<>brink of a second deva1sura war. At this stage Brahma1
<>went to Br2haspati's house and questioned Ta1ra1 as to
<>who really was her child's father, and she named Candra.
<>Upon this Brahma1 asked Br2haspati to release the child
<>to Candra. Br2haspati did so. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pratha-
<>ma Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Wives of Candra.%} Candra took twentyseven daugh-
<>ters of Daks2a as his wives. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha). These twentyseven wives are the twenty-
<>seven stars. Candra circumambulates Maha1meru along
<>with these, his twentyseven wives (Stars). (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 163, Verse 33). The names of the
<>twentyseven wives are given hereunder: As4vini1, Bha-
<>ran2i1, Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu,
<>Pus2ya, A1s4les2a1, Janakam3, Pha1lguni1, Uttarapha1lguni1,
<>Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti, Vis4a1kha1, Anura1dha1, Jyes2t2ha1,
<>Mu1la1, Purva1s2a1d2ha1, Uttara1s2a1d2ha1, S4ron2a1, S4ravis2t2ha,
<>Pracetas, Pu1rvapros2t2hapada1, Uttarapros2t2hapada1,
<>Revati1.
<NI>{%Solar eclipse according to the Pura1n2as.%} The Devas and
<>the asuras jointly churned Ks2i1ra1bdhi wherefrom emerg-
<>ed Dhanvantari with the Amr2takumbha (pot of nectar).
<>(See Amr2tam).
<NI>But an asura ma1ya1vi1 (magician) called Saim3hikeya
<>absconded to Pa1ta1la with the Amr2takumbha which
<>nobody noticed as everybody was busy with dividing
<>other divine objects. Only after the ma1ya1vi1's disap-
<>pearance was it noticed that the Amr2ta Kumbha was
<>missing. At once Maha1vis2n2u assumed the figure of a
<>beautiful woman, got back the Kumbha and gave it to
<>the devas. The devas began drinking the amr2tam when,
<>at the instance of some other devas, Saim3hikeya, the
<>ma1ya1vi1 assuming the form of an old brahmin reached
<>svarga, got a share of the amr2ta and began to drink it.
<>Su1rya and Candra (Sun and Moon) who were on
<>guard at the gates divined the secret of the ‘old
<>brahmin’ and informed Maha1vis2n2u about it. He cut
<>the throat of the pseudo-brahmin with his Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. But, half of the nectar he had drunk stayed
<>above the throat and the other half below it. Therefore,
<>though the head and the trunk were severed they
<>remained alive. These two parts, in course of time,
<>evolved as Ra1hu and Ketu.
<NI>When the throat was cut some blood as well as some
<>amr2ta dropped on two places on the ground, and they [Page172-a+ 64]
<>became the red onion and the white onion respecti-
<>vely. Some vaidika brahmins used to consider the red
<>onion objectionable for consumption as it was evolved
<>from blood, while the white onion was considered
<>usable as it was evolved from amr2tam.
<NI>R2a1hu and Ketu still maintain their hatred for Su1rya
<>and Candra who had betrayed the asura, who, disguis-
<>ed as brahmin tried to drink the amr2ta. Eclipse is the
<>phenomenon of Ra1hu and Ketu swallowing Su1rya and
<>Candra as and when opportunity presents itself for it.
<>But, since the throat is severed from the body, Su1rya
<>and Candra thus swallowed get out through the throat.
<>That is the reason why Su1rya and Candra become
<>visible after the eclipse in over. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a and Bha1gavata As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>5) {%Candra besame Calf.%} Once emperor Pr2thu trans-
<>formed Bha1midevi1 into a cow and milked from her all
<>things and provisions. On that occasion it was Brahma1,
<>who acted as Calf. And, following Pr2thu when the
<>R2s2is milked the cow Candra served as Calf. (For
<>details see Pr2thu).
<NI>6) {%Waxing and waning of Candra, the pura1n2ic story regard-
<>ding it.%} Of the twentyseven daughters of Daks2a whom
<>Candra had married he loved Rohin2i1 much more than
<>the other twentysix wives, and so kept her always with
<>him. This annoyed the twentysix wives, who complained
<>about it to Daks2a. Daks2a's advice to Candra to treat
<>all the wives on an equal footing had no effect on him.
<>So, the twentysix neglected wives again complained to
<>Daks2a as follows: “We shall stay in the a1s4rama and
<>serve you. Soma (Candra) does not associate with us,
<>he will not accept your advice.”
<NI>Though Daks2a warned Candra a second time, that too
<>had no effect on him. So the twentysix wives, for the
<>third time, complained to Daks2a. Daks2a got angry at
<>this and cursed that Candra should suffer from tuber-
<>culosis. Thus Candra was afflicted by consumption.
<>Though Candra performed many a yajn5a to get cured
<>of the fell disease, they did not produce the desired
<>effect. Candra remaining a tubercular patient, the
<>growth of medicinal plants stopped with the result that
<>all living things contracted consumption. When people
<>began becoming thinner, the devas asked Candra for
<>an explanation, and he told them all the details. They
<>then sought the help of Daks2a, who gave Candra
<>redemption from the curse by ordaining that if he dived
<>in the Sarasvati1 ti1rtha in the western sea he would be
<>free from consumption for half of every month. Thence-
<>forth Candra made it a practice to dive in the Saras-
<>vati1ti1rtha and that is the reason why Candra is exempt-
<>ed from Ks2ayaroga for fifteen days. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 35).
<NI>7) {%Candra--King of stars and of medicines.%} During the
<>reign of emperor Pr2thu, he changed Bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow. Later the R2s2is also changed bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow and milked her. It was Candra who served as
<>calf then. Pleased at this Brahman crowned Candra as
<>king of the stars and medicines. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter
<>4, Verse 2).
<NI>8) {%Other information about Candra%}
<NI>(1) Candra is 11,000 sq. yojanas in area, 33,000 yojanas
<>in circumference and a volume of 5,900 cubic yojanas.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12).
<NI>(2) Candra presented two attendants called Man2i and [Page172-b+ 65]
<>Sumati to Subrahman2ya (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45,
<>Verse 32).
<NI>(3) Candra once made a discourse on the superior
<>qualities of brahmins to S4ambara1sura. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 13, Southern Text).
<NI>(4) All welfare and prosperity accrue to him, who on
<>full-moon day at moon-rise tenders offerings to Candra
<>of bread in copper vessels with honey poured into it.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 36, Verse, 13, Southern
<>Text).
<NI>(5) Candra is one of the as2t2a-vasus. Candra had
<>four sons, Varcas, S4is4ira, Pra1n2a and Raman2a by his
<>wife named Manohara1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 18).
<NI>(6) Abhimanyu was Candra's son, Varcas, reborn as
<>the son of Arjuna. (See Abhimanyu).
<HI>CANDRA1. An important river in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 29).
<HI>CANDRAGUPTA I. Second son of Ra1van2a. Once
<>when S4ri1 Ra1ma was King, Candragupta abducted the
<>daughter o! Sugri1va and the daughter-in-law of Vibhi1-
<>s2an2a. Hanuma1n released them both as ordered by S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a Uttara Ka1n2d2a; also see
<>Sahasramukha Ra1van2a).
<HI>CANDRAGUPTA II. A minister of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was once fed sumptuously by Jamad-
<>agni at his a1s4rama with the help of S4us4i1la1, the deva-
<>surabhi (divine cow). Candragupta, at the instance of
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna tried to capture Sus4i1la1 by force, which
<>disappeared immediately in the sky. Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna's
<>servants then forcibly took away its calf. Candragupta
<>thrashed to death Jamadagni, who tried to obstruct
<>their action. (See Ka1rtavi1rya, Para 9).
<HI>CANDRAHANTA1. An asura, who was reborn as King
<>S4unaka. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 677, Verse 37).
<HI>CANDRAHARTA1. A son born to Kas2yapa praja1pati of
<>Sim3hika1, daughter of Daks2a. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65, Verse 31).
<HI>CANDRAHA1SA. Son of King Sudha1rmika of Kerala.
<>The following story about him is told in Jaimini As4va-
<>medha Parva.
<NI>Candraha1sa, born under the star Mu1lam had a sixth
<>finger on the left foot indicative of poverty and of all
<>other evils. And, therefore, on his birth enemies killed
<>Sudha1rmika and his wife followed him soon to the
<>other world. The child thus left an orphan was taken
<>to Kaun2d2alakapuri1 by a female inmate of the palace.
<>But unfortunately the woman died within three years
<>of the above incident. The child, just for very existence,
<>took to begging. After sometime some women jointly
<>took up charge of the boy. Once he went to the house
<>of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, minister of Kaun2d2ala where a feast
<>was in progress. The munis present there were impres-
<>sed by Candraha1sa and prophesied that he would be-
<>come a King. To Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the munis said that the
<>child would guard his wealth. Angry and suspicious at
<>the prophesy of the munis Dhr2s2t2abuddhi asked his men
<>to kill the boy. They led him to the forest. On the
<>way Candraha1sa got a S4a1lagra1ma (a small sacred stone
<>which represented some upadevata1) which he applied
<>very devotedly to his face. They did not in fact kill the
<>boy, but cut off his sixth finger on the left foot and
<>showed it to their master.
<NI>Thus left alive in the forest by the murderers the
<>boy was roaming about when the King af Kalinda on [Page173-a+ 65]
<>a hunting expedition saw the destitute boy, and taking
<>pity on him took him back with him to the palace.
<>The boy was put under the care of Medha1vati1, the
<>King's consort. The king named him Candraha1sa. Since
<>the King took a special interest in the education of
<>the child he became adept in all arts and sciences. At
<>the age of twelve Candraha1sa, with the permission of
<>the king, set out on a triumphal tour, and the king
<>welcomed Candraha1sa on his return after his glorious
<>victory that brought him wealth.
<NI>At the instance of the Kalinda king, Candraha1sa, sent by
<>his messengers tribute to the Kaun2d2ala king, who, under-
<>standing from them that so much of wealth had been
<>brought to the Kalinda king by Candraha1sa started at
<>once for the Kalinda palace. On being told the whole
<>story about Candraha1sa, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the minister of
<>the King of Kaun2d2ala made up his mind to do away with
<>him somehow or other for which he despatched a letter
<>to his son, Madana, through Candraha1sa.
<NI>Candraha1sa on his way to Kaun2d2ala slept on the banks
<>of a river. Campakama1lini1, the daughter of the King
<>of Kaun2d2ala and Vis2aya1, daughter of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi
<>happened to go to the river bank where Candraha1sa
<>was sleeping. Campakama1lini1, who became subject to
<>great love for Candraha1sa removed the anklets on her
<>feet and approached him slowly, and when she took up
<>and read a letter she found lying beside him, she felt
<>awe and sorrow to find therein a suggestion to poison
<>him to death. Without wasting much time in thought she
<>changed the word ‘vis2amasmai’ (give him poison) to
<>‘Vis2aya1smai’ (give him Vis2aya1) and put it in its former
<>place. After some time when Candraha1sa awoke from
<>sleep and reached Kaun2d2ala city and delivered the letter
<>to Madana its content pleased him very much. As for
<>Vis2aya1, she was spending her days in constant prayer
<>that Candraha1sa should marry her. In the cir-
<>cumstances the marriage of Candraha1sa and Vis2aya1 was
<>solemnised on the earliest auspicious day.
<NI>In due course Dhr2s2t2abuddhi returned to Kaun2d2ala with
<>all the wealth he could lay his hands upon after capturing
<>Kalinda. He seethed with grief and rage at the news
<>that Vis2aya1 had been married to Candraha1sa. All the
<>explanations offered by Madana did not satisfy him. He
<>persisted in his determination to kill Candraha1sa.
<NI>The evil-minded Dhr2s2t2abuddhi one day asked Candra-
<>ha1sa to go and worship at the Devi1 temple after having
<>made arrangements for his murder there. But, as fate
<>would have it, it was Madana who, instead of Candra-
<>ha1sa, was killed. Even before the above incident had
<>happened the Kaun2dala King had married his daughter
<>Candrama1lini1 to Candraha1sa, and after relinquishing
<>the kingdom also in his favour the King took to the forest
<>to lead a hermit's life.
<NI>The above developments added fuel to the fire of anger
<>in respect of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, and when he saw in the
<>temple precincts, his son's corpse he became well-nigh
<>mad. Crying out that all this was the result of his having
<>troubled the Vais2n2ava Candraha1sa he dashed his head
<>against the pillars of the temple and died.
<NI>Candraha1sa was grieved over the death of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi.
<>He worshipped Devi1 offering his flesh in the sacrificial
<>fire. Devi1 appeared and granted him two boons which
<>helped him to bring Dhr2s2t2abuddhi and Madana back to
<>life. And, when the Kalinda king and his wife, fearing the
<>wicked Dhr2s2t2abuddhi were about to end their lives in [Page173-b+ 65]
<>flaming fire, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi went to them and imparted
<>to them the secrets about the life of Candraha1sa. The
<>Kalinda king and his wife dropped their former decision
<>to end their life, and Candraha1sa took up the reins of
<>government at the behest of the King. Candraha1sa,
<>who won repute as a very powerful and effective ruler,
<>during the As4vamedha sacrifice of Yudhis2t2hira captured
<>the sacrificial horse, and Arjuna, at the instance of
<>Kr2s2n2a had to enter into a pact with Candraha1sa, who
<>promised him help for the success of the sacrifice. Candra-
<>ha1sa had a son called Makara1ks2a by Vis2aya1 and another
<>son, Padma1ks2a by Campakama1lini1.
<HI>CANDRAHA1SA (M). Ra1van2a's sword. Ra1van2a, in the
<>course of his triumphal tour after receiving the boons
<>from Brahman, subjugated kings, and marching north-
<>ward reached the valleys of Mount Kaila1sa. But, Nandi-
<>kes4vara stopped him there, and Ra1van2a, threatening to
<>throw away S4iva, master of Nandikes4vara along with
<>Kaila1sa, put his twenty hands under it to pull it out,
<>and the great mountain shook violently. Pa1rvati1 got
<>frightened and running upto S4iva embraced him.
<>S4iva, who divined the reason for all these with his eye of
<>supreme knowledge grounded the mountain firmly on
<>earth, crushing Ra1van2a's hands under it. Unable to
<>take away his arms from under the mountain, Ra1van2a
<>remained there for about thousand years singing the
<>praises of the Lord. At last S4iva appeared to Ra1van2a
<>and presented him with a sword called Candraha1sa.
<>It was this sword which won victories for Ra1van2a in
<>future wars. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU I. A son of S4atrughna, brother of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. S4atrughna had two sons. An3gada and Candra-
<>ketu by his wife S4rutaki1rti (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU II. A vidya1dhara King. See Mukta1-
<>phalaketu).
<HI>CANDRAMAS. A r2s2i who imparted spiritual knowledge
<>to Sampa1ti and advised Jat2a1yu to give directions about
<>the way to the monkeys in their search for Si1ta1devi1.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CA1NDRAMASI1. Ta1ra1, the wife of Br2haspati. She fell in
<>love with Candra and lived with him for sometime, and
<>came to be called Ca1ndramasi1. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 219; see also Ta1ra1).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 I. Wife of king Haris4candra reputed for
<>his unique honesty and integrity. (See Haris4candra).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 II. A city. Two sons, Taks2aka and
<>Citraketu were born to Laks2man2a of U1rmila1. Taks2aka
<>was crowned King of Agati, a city built on the eastern
<>coast of the sea after annihilating the hunter tribe there,
<>and Citraketu was crowned king of Candramati1, a city
<>built on the western coast of the sea after killing all the
<>Mlecchas there. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRA1N3GADA. Grandson of Nala. He married
<>Si1mantini1, daughter of Citravarman, a king of A1rya1varta.
<>Si1mantini1, hearing about Candra1n3gada fell in love
<>with him, and it was with the help of Maitreyi1, wife of
<>Ya1jn5avalkya, that she was wedded to him.
<NI>While once Candra1n3gada was enjoying a boat-race in
<>Ka1lindi1 (river) with his friends a storm upset the boat
<>and most of them were drowned to death. The servants
<>of Taks2aka saw Candra1n3gada sinking to the bottom
<>of the river and carried him to Pa1ta1la and he stayed
<>there for sometime in the midst of amorous na1ga damsels.
<>Candra1n3gada's people, under the impression that he
<>had died, performed his funeral rites, and Si1mantini1 [Page174-a+ 65]
<>took to widow's life. Enemies captured his kingdom
<>and imprisoned his father, Indrasena. When once the
<>na1ga King asked Candra1n3gada to marry na1ga girls and
<>settle down in Pa1ta1la he told the King that he was already
<>married and that his wife Si1mantini1 was brooding over
<>him, and he had, therefore, to return to her. Accordingly
<>the na1ga king sent him back with presents of a white
<>horse, a Ra1ks2asa and an infant serpent.
<NI>Candra1n3gada, with his presents, came up in Ka1lindi1
<>where Si1mantini1, grief-stricken was spending her days
<>in penance, and they recognised each other. Informed
<>about the return of Candra1n3gada the enemy kings releas-
<>ed his father from captivity and apologised to him.
<>And he pardoned them.
<NI>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 took great interest in observ-
<>ing somava1ravrata (fasting etc. on Mondays) and pleased
<>at the vrata of the latter S4ri1 Pa1rvati1 blessed her. Two
<>brahmins called Devamitra and Sa1rasvata were living
<>there at the time. Three sons called Sumedha, Sa1rasvata
<>and Sa1mava1n were born to Devamitra. The sons also
<>turned out to be great scholars but they were poor.
<>They could not get brides as they were poor. In the
<>hope that they would get some money if they approached
<>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 the brahmins went to
<>them. After hearing their story the king and his queen
<>conducted them in a procession in the precincts of the
<>palace, Sumedha dressed as husband and Sa1mava1n
<>as his wife. But, lo! when the procession was over
<>Sa1mava1n could not be divested of his womanhood, and
<>Si1mantini1 named her Sa1mavati1. Being told that his
<>son had turned woman Sa1rasvata sought the advice of
<>some munis to remedy the situation. But, all the attempts
<>of the munis to change the woman to man failed, and
<>they opined that only Pa1rvati1, who had been pleased
<>by the Somava1ravrata, would be able to find a solution
<>to the problem. From that day onwards the brahmin
<>youths lived as husband and wife. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Soma-
<>va1ravratam).
<HI>CANDRA1PI1D2A. A son of Janamejaya. Pari1ks2it was the
<>son of Abhimanyu (Arjuna's son). Janamejaya was
<>Pari1ks2it's son. Janamejaya married princess Vapus2t2ama1
<>of Ka1s4i. Two sons called Candra1pi1d2a and Su1rya1pi1d2a
<>were born to the couple. Candra1pi1d2a had hundred sons,
<>who distinguished themselves as great heroes in archery.
<>Satyakarn2a was the eldest among the sons. S4vetakarn2a,
<>son of Satyakarn2a, married Ya1davi1, the daughter of
<>Suca1ru. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA. (See Su1ryaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA1. Mother of the wonderful girl,
<>Somaprabha1. (See Somaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 I. A great sinner, who killed his
<>preceptor. The Padma Pura1n2a relates the story of four
<>sinners named Vidura, Candras4arman, Vedas4arman
<>and Van5jula, who shed their sin by bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1. The sins committed by the four were respectively
<>Brahmahatya1 (killing of brahmin), Guruhatya1 (killing
<>of the preceptor), Agamya1gamana (having sexual con-
<>tact with women like the wife of guru which is debarred)
<>and Govadha (killing of cow) respectively. The leader
<>of the above four sinners was one Vidura of the Pa1n5ca1la
<>des4a. He was begging in the streets without the tuft
<>of hair, the sacred thread and tilaka (mark of sandal
<>paste etc. on the forehead). He went from house to
<>house begging for alms crying thus: “Here is come the
<>man (himself) who committed Brahmahatya1. Please [Page174-b+ 65]
<>give alms to the brahmin-killer who is a drunkard also.”
<>During his begging tour he visited all the ti1rthas also,
<>yet brahmahatya1 stuck on to him.
<NI>While this sinner Vidura, his heart rent with sorrow and
<>remorse, was sitting under a tree, a Ma1gadha brahmin
<>called Candras4arman happened to come there. This
<>brahmin had committed the sin of guruhatya1 (killing the
<>preceptor). He told Vidura:--“While residing with the
<>guru, blinded by desire, I killed the guru, and am now
<>burning myself in the fire of repentance.”
<NI>While they were engaged thus in conversation a third
<>person, called Vedas4arman also came there in an absolu-
<>tely tired condition. He told Vidura and Candras4arman
<>that his relatives and others had cast him out as he once
<>did the sin of agamya1gamana, and by the time he had
<>finished telling his story a Vais4ya called Van5jula came
<>there. Besides drinking liquor he had committed govadha
<>(killing of cow) also. Though these four sinners assemb-
<>led at the same place, they only talked, but did not touch
<>one another, take food together, rest on the same seat
<>or lie on the same bedsheet.
<NI>According to the advice of a Siddha (an evolved soul)
<>the four sinners dived in the holy waters of Gan3ga1 and
<>came out redeemed of their sins. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 91).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 II. A brahmin of Agni gotra from
<>Ma1ya1pura, he was the disciple and son-in-law of Deva-
<>s4arman. Both of them were killed by a Ra1ks2asa while
<>they were gathering darbha (a particular variety of
<>grass used in religious ceremonies) in the forest. Candra-
<>s4arma1 attained Vaikun2t2ha as he was a very righteous
<>person. During Kr2s2n2a1vata1ra (incarnation of Vis2n2u
<>as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a) he was born as Acru1ra. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAS4EKHARA. A King (son of Paus2ya). The
<>following story about his birth is told in the Padma
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Though married for a long time Paus2ya did not have an
<>issue. He began worshipping S4iva to be blessed with a
<>son. S4iva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit
<>which he divided equally among his three wives. In
<>due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the
<>full and complete form of a child the three children had to
<>be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This
<>boy was Candras4ekhara. Thus Candras4ekhara acquired
<>the name Tryam3baka.
<NI>Candras4ekhara married Ta1ra1vati1, daughter of Kaku-
<>tstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the
<>curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhr2n3gi and Maha1ka1la
<>were born to Ta1ra1vati1 in Veta1la yoni and Bhairava
<>yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were
<>sons born to Candras4ekhara himself. (Aurasaputras).
<HI>CANDRASENA I. A king of Sim3hala des4a (Ceylon).
<>Candrasena had two daughters, Mandodari1 and Indu-
<>mati1 by his wife Gun2avati1. Kambugri1va, son of Sudh-
<>anva1, the chief of Ma1dra desired to marry Mandodari1.
<>But, since she preferred unmarried life Kambugri1va's
<>desire did not fructify. Some time later she refused to
<>marry another suitor also, King Vi1rasena of Kosala.
<>Meanwhile the marriage of her younger sister, Indumati1
<>was celebrated, herself having selected Sudes2n2a, the
<>Ma1dra prince at the Svayam3vara as husband. Though a
<>handsome person Sudes2n2a was a philanderer, and one
<>day Indumati1 saw him in bed with her maid-servant.
<>From that day onwards, cutting asunder all marital
<>relationship with Sudes2n2a, Indumati1 went and stayed [Page175-a+ 64]
<>with her father. This story told by Mahis2a1sura to show
<>that women possess only very little discretion occurs in
<>the Pan5cama Skandha of Devi1bha1gavata.
<HI>CANDRASENA II. A king of Ujjayani1 and a great
<>devotee of S4iva. As he performed great sacrifices and
<>gave away money and materials in gift to those who pray-
<>ed for them, an attendant of S4iva called Man2ibhadra
<>once gave him a gem, which possessed supernatural
<>powers. Attracted by the lustre and glare of the gem
<>many kings wanted to purchase it. But Candrasena
<>refused to sell it. Much incensed at the refusal, the enemy
<>kings set out to fight Candrasena, who then took refuge
<>in the Maha1ka1la temple in Ujjayani1 the idol installed in
<>which was S4ivalin3ga. Lord S4iva then appeared to him
<>and granted him salvation. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4aniprado-
<>s2ama1ha1tmyam).
<HI>CANDRASENA III. The Maha1bha1rata refers to another
<>Candrasena, son of Samudrasena, King of Bengal. He
<>was present at the svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 11). Bhi1masena once defeat-
<>ed Candrasena and his father in fight. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 30, Verse 24). After that Candrasena became a
<>supporter of the Pa1n2d2avas. It is stated in Dron2a Parva
<>that in the great war Candrasena fought from a chariot
<>drawn by horses as white as Candra (moon) and got
<>killed by As4vattha1ma1.
<HI>CANDRASENA IV. Another Candrasena, a partisan of
<>the Kauravas, is referred to in the Bha1rata as having
<>fought against the Pa1n2d2avas. His duty was to guard the
<>chariot wheels of S4alya; he was killed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 52).
<HI>CANDRASI1TA1. A female attendant of Skandadeva.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 11).
<HI>CANDRAS4RI1. A woman, who, though actually in love
<>with her husband enjoyed life with her paramour.
<>Candras4ri1 is the heroine of a story narrated in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara to prove that the interest married women take
<>in clandestine relationship is only due to fleeting temp-
<>tations. Candras4ri1 was the wife of a vais4ya called Ba1la-
<>varman, who lived in the city of Pratis2t2ha1na. One day,
<>looking out through the windows in her house she saw
<>the very handsome vais4ya youth called S4i1laha1ra and
<>felt great desire for him. She brought him secretly to
<>the house of her companion and satisfied her desire.
<>When their meeting became a routine affair her relations
<>and servants knew about it. And, her husband alone was
<>unaware of it. Once he became ill with severe fever.
<>Even while he was in his death-bed Candras4ri1 continued
<>her affair with the paramour. When one day she was
<>with her paramour thus, she was told that her husband
<>was no more. At once she took leave of him, returned
<>home and committed suicide by jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of the husband. (Katha1saritsa1gara, S4aktiyas4olam-
<>baka, Taran3ga 2).
<HI>CANDRA1S4VA (M). Son of King Kuvalaya1s4va of the
<>Iks2va1ku dynasty. He had two brothers called Dr2d2ha1s4va
<>and Kapila1s4va. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 24).
<HI>CANDRASVA1MI1. A brahmin, who got back his life by
<>worshipping Su1rya. He stayed with his wife, Devamati1
<>in Kamalapura ruled by King Kamalavarman. A son
<>called Mahi1pa1la was born to him, and at the time of the
<>birth of the child a celestial voice declared that Mahi1pa1la
<>would become King. A few years later a daughter called
<>Candramati1 also was born to Candrasva1mi1. [Page175-b+ 65]
<>During this period, rains having failed, very severe
<>famine stalked Kamalapura. Even the king unmindful of
<>justice and righteousness began extracting from the
<>people whatever they possessed. Finding the situation
<>deteriorated so much Candrasva1mi1 set out for his father-
<>in-law's house with Mahi1pa1la and Candramati1, and on
<>the way they had to cross what was once a wild forest,
<>but which had by then been denuded of green trees or
<>other foliage due to the failure of the rains. The children
<>were severely afflicted by thirst, and so the father, after
<>leaving them at the foot of a tree went in search of water
<>when he was caught by the people of the forest king and
<>taken before him. When he knew that he was about to
<>be given in sacrifice to Devi1 the brahmin folded his
<>hands and prayed to Su1ryadeva, who appeared before
<>him and assured him that not only will death not visit
<>him, but also he would be united with his wife and
<>children.
<NI>The children left under the tree began crying, their
<>father having not returned to them, and a Vais4ya called
<>Sa1rthadha1ra who came that way felt pity for the crying
<>children and took them to his house. One day
<>Anantasva1mi1, a brahmin and a minister of King
<>Ta1ra1na1tha of Ta1ra1pura happened to visit Sa1rthadha1ra.
<>Anantasva1mi1, who had no children of his own took away
<>with him the children from Sa1rthadha1ra.
<NI>One day Su1ryadeva appeared to the forest king in his
<>sleep and asked him not to kill the brahmin (Candra-
<>sva1mi) held captive by him. The very next morning
<>Candrasva1mi1 was released from captivity. Roaming
<>about in quest of his children, Candrasva1mi1 reached the
<>city called Jalapura where he was put up as the guest
<>of a house-holder. One day the host told Candrasva1mi1
<>that a vais4ya called Kanakavarman had, a few days back,
<>told him that he (Kanakavarman) had got two children,
<>one male and the other female from the forest, and taken
<>them to the Na1likera island. The very next day Candra-
<>sva1mi1, along with a vais4ya called Vis2n2uvarman arrived
<>at the Na1likera island, and on enquiry they were told
<>that Kanakavarman, with the children had left for
<>Kat2a1ha island. They then went to Kat2a1ha island only
<>to be told that Kanakavarman had gone to Karpu1ra
<>island. With another Vais4ya Candrasva1mi landed on the
<>Karpu1ra island to no purpose. After thus going to the
<>Suvarn2a and Sim3hala islands too Candrasva1mi met
<>Kanakavarman at Citraku1t2apura. Kanakavarman
<>showed the children to Candrasva1mi, but they were not
<>his. He burst into tears, and returned from Citraku1t2a-
<>pura. He passed on his way back many a temple and
<>city and at dusk reached a big forest. He satisfied his
<>hunger by eating some roots and fruits, and got upon
<>a tree and sat on the top of it. It was mid-night, yet
<>sleep did not oblige him. Then he saw a ma1tr2san3gha
<>(a group of women) consisting of Na1ra1yan2i1 and others
<>come and dance at the foot of the tree. Na1ra1yan2i1 saw
<>Candrasva1mi1 and after the dance was over and her
<>companions had left the place Na1ra1yan2i1 called him down
<>from the tree and gave him a flower. And, according
<>to the advice of Na1ra1yan2i1 the next day morning Candra-
<>sva1mi1 went to Ta1ra1pura where, accidentally he got into
<>the house of Anantasva1mi1, minister of the kingdom, and,
<>for food, repeated vedic hymns. The minister invited him
<>for meals, and there he saw Mahi1pa1la and Candra1vati1.
<>He placed the flower presented by Na1ra1yan2i1 on Mahi1-
<>pa1la's nose whereupon the children recognised him, [Page176-a+ 65]
<>their father. The people celebrated it as a happy day.
<>King Ta1ra1varman gave his daughter, Vasumati1, in
<>marriage to Mahi1pa1la along with half his kingdom.
<>They went to Kamalapura and returned with their
<>mother. All of them spent their days very happily at
<>Ta1ra1pura. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Alan3ka1ravati1 Lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 6).
<HI>CANDRA1VALOKA. A King of Citraku1t2anagara.
<NI>When once the King in the course of a hunting expedition
<>came to the bank of a river tired and done up he saw
<>there the very beautiful lady, Indi1varaprabha1, daughter
<>of Mahars2i Kan2va by Menaka1. Having fallen in love
<>with each other they went to the a1s4rama of the mahars2i
<>where, at his instance, Candra1valoka took the pledge not
<>to kill animals in future, and Kan2va married his daugh-
<>ter to the King. On their way back to the palace the
<>couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which be-
<>longed to a Brahmaraks2as, who caught hold of them,
<>but released them on condition that they gave him in
<>their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they re-
<>turned to Citraku1t2a and told about the incident to
<>minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold
<>equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and
<>a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would
<>be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy
<>seven years old. A brahmin boy was got, and he was
<>given to the Brahmaraks2as. (Katha1saritsa1gara S4as4a1n3ka-
<>vati1 Lam3baka, Taran3ga 27).

<>bands for them also from among the Ya1davas. Prabha1-
<>vati1, in her childhood had learnt from Durva1sas a

<HI>CA1RVA1KA I. A Ra1ks2asa, who was a close friend of

<NI>In the Kr2tayuga this Ra1ks2asa did tapas to please Brah-
<>ma1 at Badarya1s4rama, and Brahma1 gave him the
<>boon that he would be safe from all beings. Then he
<>went round the world troubling brahmins, who, at
<>last sought refuge in Brahma1, and he pacified them
<>with the assurance that Ca1rva1ka would become a friend
<>of Duryodhana when he would insult Brahmins and
<>be reduced to ashes in the fire of their anger.
<NI>Accordingly Ca1rva1ka became a friend of Duryodhana.
<>When, after the great war, Dharmaputra entered
<>Hastina1pura with his followers thousands of brahmins
<>gathered around and blessed him. Ca1rva1ka also dis-
<>guised as a brahmin came there and condemning Dhar-
<>maputra as an enemy of his own people cursed him.
<>The brahmins recognised him and cursed him to ashes.

<HI>CATURA1SYA. A heroic asura. Once he fell in love
<>with Rambha1, and on his request Svayamprabha1,
<>Rambha1's attendant, won over her mistress to the asura.
<>The asura, Rambha1 and Svayamprabha1 then shifted
<>their residence to a beautiful palace built in south India
<>by Maya for Catura1sya. But, Indra who felt Rambha1's
<>absence badly came down to earth, killed Catura1sya
<>and took Rambha1 back with him. Indra cursed Svayam-
<>prabha1 to remain on earth. And, he told her that she
<>should welcome and treat well the monkeys who would
<>be arriving there in their quest of Si1ta1, and then she
<>would get redemption from the curse. The above facts
<>were revealed by Svayamprabha1 herself while welcom-
<>ing the monkeys. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CATURDAS4I1MA1HA1TMYA. The pura1n2as declare
<>that worshipping S4iva on Caturdas4i1 day will satisfy all

<>ing this claim. (See Kumudvati1).
<HI>CATURDAM3S2T2RA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>He always showed great devotion towards Brahmins.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 62).
<HI>CATURIKA1. A harlot about whom the following story
<>is told in Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Once a poor Brahmin got a piece of gold as Pratigraha
<>(fee or daks2in2a1 for performing a religious rite). While
<>he was perplexed not knowing what to do with the gold,
<>a Vit2a advised him to go on tour with the money got by [Page179-a+ 65]
<>selling the gold. The poor Brahmin did not even know
<>how to go on tour. Then the Vit2a advised him to visit a
<>harlot called Caturika1, who lived close by and who,
<>the Vita said, would teach him how to go on tour.
<NI>Brahmin:--What shall I do first after going to the
<>harlot's house?
<NI>Vit2a:--Caturika1 will become friendly if you would
<>give her the gold. Then you should use sweet and charm-
<>ing words, and that is all.
<NI>The Brahmin went immediately to Caturika1's house and
<>he was received honourably by her. Then giving the
<>gold to her he requested her to instruct him about going
<>on tour. This request of his evoked laughter from people
<>around him. Then the Brahmin who was versed in the
<>S4rutis began reciting the Sa1man with his palm formed
<>in the shape of the ears of the cow. All those who were
<>present there wildly laughed at him, and somehow or
<>other he escaped from the none too pleasant scene, and
<>reported his experience at the harlot's to the Vit2a.
<>He very easily understood that the reason for the Brah-
<>min being ridiculed was that misreading his advice to
<>use ‘sa1ma’ (sweet words) the Brahmin recited the sa1ma-
<>veda. He took the brahmin back to Caturika1 and asked
<>her to return the ‘grass’ (gold given her by the brah-
<>min) to ‘the cow’, the Brahmin who was as simple as
<>the cow. Laughingly Caturika1 returned the gold to
<>him. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha Lam3bakam, Ta-
<>ran3ga 6).
<HI>CA1TURMA1SYA. A penance (Vrata) which continues
<>for four months. During this period, the Vedas are to be
<>studied with pure heart. The Pa1n2d2avas did this penance
<>at Gaya1. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 95).
<HI>CATURMUKHALIN3GA. A Brahma lin3ga installed on
<>the northern bank of Sarasvati1 by Brahma1. Brahma1,
<>to start with, created animate and inanimate objects,
<>and was thinking about further creation when a beauti-
<>ful girl, born of herself appeared before him. Brahma1
<>became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbe-
<>coming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his
<>heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahma1, went to
<>the Stha1n2uti1rtha, which washes off all sins, on the north-
<>ern bank of Sarasvati1 and installed his own lin3ga, known
<>as the Caturmukhalin3ga. This installation of lin3ga
<>redeemed him from sins. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 49).
<HI>CATURTHI1VRATA. A fast undertaken so that one
<>may be happy for one year, may achieve all desires and
<>attain S4ivaloka. While observing this fast one should
<>worship Gan2apati on the fourth day after New Moon
<>(Caturthi1) in the month of Makara (February-March).
<>Next day the fast should be broken by eating cooked
<>rice and oil seeds. The Mu1lamantra of Gan2apati is
<>‘gam3 sva1ha1’; hr2daya1dis2ad2an3gas beginning with ‘gam’.
<>‘A1gaccha1tika1ya’ is the a1va1hana mantra and ‘Gaccha1-
<>tika1ya’ the visarjana mantra. Gan2apati should be
<>worshipped with mantras ending with ‘tun3ka1ya’ and
<>beginning with ‘gaka1ra’ as also with offering of sandal
<>paste, rice balls etc. “Om3 Mahotka1ya1ya vidmahe vakra-
<>tun2d2a1ya dhi1mahi tanno danti1 pracodaya1t” is the Gan2es4a
<>ga1yatri1 mantra. He or she who performs the Caturthi1
<>vrata will attain S4ivaloka. If Gan2apati is worshipped
<>on a Tuesday which is also Caturthi1 the devotee will
<>get all his desires satisfied. Caturthi1 occurring in Mi1na
<>(March-April) is called Avighnacaturthi1, and that day
<>fasting should be in the night. On Caturthi1 in April-
<>May Gan2apati should be worshipped with damanaka [Page179-b+ 65]
<>flowers, and then the worshipper will become very
<>happy. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 179). Also see Vina1yaka
<>Caturthi1.
<HI>CATURUPA1YAM. The four means used by Kings in
<>olden times to achieve their objects are called Caturu-
<>pa1yam. Sa1ma, da1na, bheda and dan2d2a are the Catur-
<>upa1yas (four tactics). There are three other upa1yas
<>also, almost equally important as the first four, and the
<>seven upa1yas are collectively called Saptopa1yas. There
<>are also yet other upa1yas, but they are not important
<>enough to merit special mention.
<NI>1) {%Sa1ma.%} It is the best means to attract and convert
<>others to one's side. It consists in winning people with
<>sweet words and looks. People who are friendly by
<>temperament and straightforward may be brought
<>round by sa1ma. Sa1ma is employed in dealing with sons,
<>brothers and other relatives.
<NI>2) {%Da1na.%} There are five kinds or varieties of da1na
<>(gift) viz. pri1tida1na, dravyada1na, svayam3gra1ha, deya
<>and pratimoks2a. If a person gets help from another
<>and acknowledges help by reward that reward is
<>called pri1tida1na. The miser and the poor should be
<>brought round by pri1tida1na. Military captains, heroes
<>and citizens should be won over by this da1na. Those
<>who fall at feet should be honoured by da1na.
<NI>3) {%Bheda.%} Bhedopa1ya is of three kinds: to destroy or
<>end the friendship subsisting between people, to create
<>dissension and to make the parties quarrel with each
<>other. He who is falsely praised, he who does not desire
<>wealth or welfare, he who has been invited to come and
<>then insulted, traitor to king, he who has been exorbi-
<>tantly taxed, the angry one, the honourable one, the
<>insulted, the unreasonably forsaken one, he who har-
<>bours hatred in his mind, the pacified one, one whose
<>wealth and wife have been taken away or stolen, he
<>who has not been respected though deserving of respect--
<>if such people are in one's opposite camp, suspicion
<>should be raked up among them and thus division crea-
<>ted in their ranks. If subordinate chieftains, and forest
<>tribes commit offences they should be brought round
<>by the use of sa1ma and bheda upa1yas.
<NI>4) {%Dan2d2a.%} Dan2d2opa1ya is of three kinds, viz, killing,
<>denuding of wealth, and inflicting pain on the body or
<>torture. Dan2d2a has two other forms, praka1s4a (open)
<>and apraka1s4a (secret). Those who have become objects
<>of hatred to all people should be subjected to praka1s4a-
<>dan2d2a. People, whose killing the world will detest,
<>should not be killed openly, but only secretly. Enemies
<>should be killed with weapons etc. Brahmins should not
<>be killed. Friends and allies should not be subjected
<>to dan2d2a; friends, who are made objects of dan2d2a will
<>wither away like worm-eaten trees. The King, who
<>possesses the three powers (of wealth, army and people's
<>support) and is fully conscious of the time and environ-
<>mental factors should annihilate enemies by the instru-
<>ment of dan2d2a. Evil people should be defeated by
<>dan2d2a itself.
<NI>The upa1ya ma1ya1 consists in practising deception by
<>magic or other yogic powers. The powers can be
<>acquired by the worship of the idols of certain Devata1s.
<>People who employ go about at night in various dis-
<>guises. They disguise themselves as beautiful women or
<>even as animals. They also deceive people by creating
<>illusions of clouds, fire or lightning. For instance, Bhi1ma
<>killed Ki1caka by going to him in the guise of a woman. [Page180-a+ 65]
<>Not to dissuade people who indulge in unjustifiable
<>grief, war etc. is the principal aim of the upa1ya called
<>upeks2a1. Hid2imbi1 gave up his brother Hidimba by
<>practising Upeks2a1. Next is the Indraja1lopa1ya (magic).
<>For example, to create illusions of clouds, darkness, rain,
<>fire, and other magic in order to instil fear among
<>troops of the enemy etc. To scare the enemy is the aim
<>of Indraja1la. (For details of Caturupa1yas see Kan2ika).
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 241).
<HI>CA1TURVARN2YAM. (The four Castes, Classes).
<NI>1) {%General.%} The pura1n2as tell that Brahma1 created the
<>four castes like Brahmins, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas and S4u1dras
<>and assigned to them duties and rules of procedure.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} Brahma1 got ready for the work of Crea-
<>tion, concentrating his mind on the universal soul, the
<>embodiment of Truth. And, the first to be born from his
<>face were people with sublime qualities, and them he
<>called Brahmins. Then emerged from his chest people
<>in whom the heroic or militant qualities preponderated.
<>(Ra1jasa). Them the Creator named Ks2atriyas. Then
<>from his thighs were born people in whom rajas and
<>tamas preponderated, and they were called Vais4yas.
<>And, lastly Brahma1 brought forth from his feet another
<>sect of people, and as tamas (darkness, cultural darkness)
<>preponderated in them they were named S4u1dras. The
<>system of four castes is called Ca1turvarn2yam. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 6).
<NI>3) {%Code of conduct.%} Ahim3sa1 (non-violence), Satyava1da
<>(speaking truth), Bhu1tada1ya (love for all living beings),
<>Ti1rthaseva1 (resort to holy places), Da1na (gifts), Brahma-
<>carya (celibacy), Vimatsaratva (absence of malice),
<>Service of Devas, Brahmins and Gurus (elders), to attend
<>to all dharmas (duties), Pitr2pu1ja1 (worship of elders)
<>eternal loyalty to King, to accomplish objects in con-
<>formity with the injunction of the S4a1stras, not to commit
<>cruel deeds, Titiks2a1 (forbearance, to put up with
<>equanimity the pair of opposites such as pleasure and
<>pain, heat and cold), belief in God--these codes of con-
<>duct are common to all Castes and in all the four stations
<>in life. Now, the special codes for each of the four
<>castes.
<NI>1) {%Brahmins.%} To perform and get performed Yajn5as,
<>to study and to teach the Vedas, to give gifts and to
<>receive gifts--these form the dharma (duties) of the
<>Brahmin. Brahmins take their second birth (dvija)
<>on the upanayana (wearing of the sacred thread).
<>The caste of the mother is the caste of the child. But
<>children born to Brahmins of their non-Brahmin wives
<>are not Brahmins. Children born of a Brahmin woman
<>to a S4u1dra1 are called Can2d2a1las. Sons born of Brahmin
<>women to Ks2atriyas are called Su1tas, and sons born of a
<>Brahmin woman to a Vais4ya are called Vaidehikas.
<>The Brahmin shall not adopt the profession of the other
<>castes. The twice-born are, however, allowed in certain
<>circumstances, the profession of agriculture, protection
<>of cows, commerce and kusi1da (to lend money on inte-
<>rest). But, he shall not trade in gorasa (milk and other
<>cow products) lavan2a (salt) and flesh. If he be an
<>agriculturist, the Brahmin may till the earth, cut medi-
<>cinal plants and destroy pests. But, he must purify the
<>soul by performing yajn5as and worshipping Devas.
<>The soil should be ploughed with eight oxen attached to
<>the plough. He may sustain himself either with R2ta
<>(food got by begging) or Amr2ta (food got not by beg-
<>ging). The suffix “S4arma1” should be added to the names [Page180-b+ 64]
<>of Brahmin children. Upanayana (wearing of the sacred
<>thread) should be done when the child is eight years
<>old. The maun5ji (girdle around the waist) to be worn

<NI>The Can2d2a1la's profession is to hang criminals sentenced
<>to death, and to live by women. The Pulkasa must
<>live by hunting. A1yogava is to act on the stage and live
<>by architecture. The Can2d2a1la should live outside the

<HI>CA1VET2T2UPAT2A. (CA1VERU). (Pat2a = army).
<NI>A particular division of the army which in olden days
<>used to come forward to lay down their lives in the
<>service of the country. When defeat in war was almost
<>certain for their king an army division under royal [Page181-a+ 64]
<>leadership was formed of heroes, who took their last
<>leave of their homes and people. The soldiers left their
<>homes with their head and eyebrows shaved, and people
<>gave them a hearty send-off. Either victory or death
<>in battlefield was their slogan. This system originated
<>in Kerala. Imitating Kerala, Turkey and Egypt formed
<>their own division of Ca1vet2t2upat2a in the 15th century.
<>The Ca1vet2t2upat2a of Turkey called the Janissary was
<>formed out of poor Christians captured in war, and that
<>of Egypt called Mamaluk was formed out of slaves.
<>But, the Ca1vet2t2upat2a of ancient Kerala was self-orga-
<>nised out of burning love for their king and country.
<>The families of those warriors of the pata who died in
<>fight were allotted royal favours. Even before, in the 14th
<>century A.D. there existed in Kerala this system of
<>Ca1vet2t2upat2a. From A.D. 1090 to 1111 A.D. many fierce
<>wars were fought between Kerala and the Cola country,
<>and it was perhaps during this period that this system of
<>fighting came into vogue. Certain inscriptions of the
<>period go to prove that Ra1mavarmakulas4ekhara Cakra-
<>varti who ruled Kerala during the above period drove
<>out the Colas from Quilon and captured places up to
<>Kot2t2ar.
<NI>Foreign writers have also referred to the Ca1vet2t2upat2a.
<>“Amouces” and “Amochi” used in the ‘Rise of Portu-
<>guese power in India’ indicate the Ca1vet2t2upat2a. “In
<>the war between Cochin and Calicut in 1504 three
<>princes of Cochin were killed, one of them being the
<>nephew of the ruling monarch. On his death 200
<>Ca1vet2t2u warriors who formed the body-guard of the
<>nephew rushed to the field after shaving their heads
<>and eyebrows and killed all the enemies they saw.”

<HI>CERA. (A king of serpents). See under Ruru.
<HI>CERIPPU. (FOOTWEAR). There is a story in
<>Maha1bha1rata of how Cerippu and Kut2a (footwear and
<>umbrella) were born. Once the heat of the Sun be-
<>came unbearable to Jamadagni and enraged at this
<>the sage started sending arrows against the Sun. His
<>wife Ren2uka1 was supplying him with arrows. When a
<>set of arrows was finished Ren2uka1 brought another set.
<>This continued without break and the Sun began to
<>feel the attack. Unable to do anything against the sage
<>the Sun heated the head and foot of Ren2uka1 on her way
<>to supply the arrows so fiercely that Ren2uka1 fell down
<>under a banyan tree exhausted. When she became well
<>enough to walk she took the arrows to her husband who
<>was very angry for her being late. She then explained
<>to him how because of the extreme heat of the sun she
<>fell down on the way. Jamadagni then started with
<>increased fury his shower of arrows and the Sun in the
<>disguise of a Brahmin approached and advised him that it
<>was not possible to strike down the Sun because he was
<>a swift-mover in the sky and so it was better to withdraw
<>from that attempt. But Jamadagni said the Sun would [Page182-a+ 65]
<>be stationary for some time at midday and then he would
<>hit the Sun down. When the Sun found that Jamadagni
<>would never drop his attempt he accepted defeat and
<>presented Jamadagni with a pair of sandals and an
<>umbrella to protect against the heat from below and
<>above. From that day onwards footwear and umbrella
<>came into vogue.
<NI>The practice of presenting sandals and umbrella is
<>being carried down from generation to generation and

<>previous birth by this name. (See Matan3ga).
<HI>CHATRAKETU. The second son born to Laks2man2a
<>of his wife U1rmila1. The eldest son was Taks2aka. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma after his return from the exile established a
<>Kingdom called Agati on the eastern sea-shore and
<>crowned Taks2aka as the King of that place. On the wes-
<>tern side after subjugating the mlechhas (low-caste

<HI>CHA1YA1. A substitute of Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4va-
<>karma1. Sam3jn5a1 got from Su1rya three children, Manu,
<>Yama and Yami1. The heat of Su1rya, her husband,
<>became unbearable to her and so she created a substitute
<>in her exact form and leaving her to look after Su1rya,
<>her husband, she left the place and went to her father.
<>Su1rya did not know of this replacement and taking her
<>to be Sam3jn5a1 he produced three children by her, S4ani,
<>Sa1varn2amanu and Tapati1. Cha1ya1 loved her sons more
<>and this made Yama angry and he raised his legs to
<>strike her when Cha1ya1 cursed that Yama's legs would fall
<>off from his body. Yama complained to his father and he
<>amended the curse and said that only some flesh from
<>his limbs would fall to the ground and that flesh would
<>serve as food to the germs in the earth. Yama would
<>escape from further injury. After consoling his son he
<>turned towards Cha1ya1. The anger of Su1rya frightened
<>her and she told him everything. Su1rya then divorced
<>her and brought back Sam3jn5a1. For details see Sam3jn5a1.

<>were born from the body of Nandini1, the cow, during
<>her fight with Vis4va1mitra. (S4loka 38, Chapter 174,

<>(Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CIRADA1TA1. There was a king called Cirada1ta1 in the
<>country called Cirapura. Though himself a good man he
<>was surrounded by bad advisers. Once a foreigner,
<>Prasan3ga, came along with two friends to the palace to
<>see the King. But due to the bad advice of his courtiers
<>the King did not care to see them even. For five years
<>they stayed there without even getting a look at the
<>King. One day the only son of the King died. All the
<>courtiers gathered round the child and pretended to
<>be greatly grieved. Prasan3ga and his friends also came
<>to the scene. They saw the king and spoke to him thus:
<>“For five years you have not cared either to see or talk to
<>us. We were cherishing a hope that at least your son
<>would give us a better treatment when he grew old and
<>became King. We were living here on that hope and now
<>that hope also has been shattered and so we are leaving
<>the place this instant.” The King was surprised to hear
<>that they were prepared even to wait for his son to
<>become the King and gave them very many presents.
<>(Taran3ga 5, Alan3ka1ravati1 Lam3baka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>CI1RAKA. A place of habitation in ancient India. Once
<>Karn2a conquered this land and from then onwards they
<>started paying tribute to Duryodhana. (S4loka 19,
<>Chapter 8, Karn2a Parva).
<HI>CIRAKA1RI1. A son of Gautama Mahars2i. He used to
<>think deeply before doing any deed and so he earned the
<>name Ciraka1ri1.
<NI>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the
<>chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded
<>his son Ciraka1ri1 to chop off the head of the latter's
<>mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the
<>forest and Ciraka1ri1 in obedience to his father's order
<>came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not
<>kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences
<>of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then
<>again who would be there to look after father if mother
<>died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might
<>regret his command and come back repentant. Thus
<>he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full
<>of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife [Page183-a+ 63]
<>alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and
<>he blessed Ciraka1ri1. (Chapter 266, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>CIRAN5JI1VI1. The name of a crow, a character in the

<>Parva).
<HI>CI1RAVA1SAS II. A yaks2a. He stayed in the court of
<>Kubera worshipping him. (S4loka 10, Chapter 10,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CIRA1YUS. An ancient King of the country Cira1yu.
<>Na1ga1rjuna was a minister of this King. Na1ga1rjuna knew
<>the secret of ‘Rasa1yanasiddhi’. Once Na1ga1rjuna pre-
<>pared a medicine for himself and the King which if
<>taken would keep them eternally young. They took
<>medicine accordingly.
<NI>After some days a child of the minister died. Grief-
<>stricken Na1ga1rjuna decided to prepare Amr2ta which
<>would eradicate death from this world. He had pre-
<>pared it but there remained one more medicine to be
<>added to this. The auspicious moment to add the same
<>was to come only after five days and Na1ga1rjuna waited.
<>The devas were frightened. If Amr2ta was made avail-
<>able on earth men would become Devas. Devas could
<>not bear this and so they sent the As4vini1kuma1ras to
<>the earth to persuade Na1ga1rjuna to desist from his work
<>of preparing Amr2ta. Further they informed him that his
<>dead child was living happily in heaven. He agreed to
<>stop his work.
<NI>After some time Cira1yus crowned his son Ji1vahara as the
<>heir-apparent. Overjoyed Ji1vahara ran to his mother
<>Dhanapara1 to give her the glad tidings. Dhanapara1
<>told her son thus: “My child, why should you be so
<>happy to think that you have become the heir-apparent.
<>Several sons of your father had already become yuvara1jas
<>and died before becoming King. Your father has taken
<>a medicine from Na1ga1rjuna and that will keep him
<>eternally young. None of his sons can aspire to be the
<>King. Your father is now eight hundred years old and
<>will live long. Many of you will become yuvara1jas but
<>not the King. I will therefore suggest a way to tide over
<>this difficulty. Everyday in the afternoon Na1ga1rjuna
<>would come outside the palace and enquire whether
<>anybody is in need of anything. At that time he would
<>give whatever was asked for. It is an opportunity when
<>you can ask for his head. When Na1ga1rjuna is dead your
<>father would either die of grief or go to the forests.
<>Then you can become the King.”
<NI>Ji1vahara was pleased to hear this suggestion and he went
<>that after-noon to the palace of Na1ga1rjuna and when
<>Na1ga1rjuna as usual came out with his query Ji1vahara
<>asked for his head. Most willingly Na1ga1rjuna offered
<>his head to be chopped off. But the effect of the medicine
<>made even the strongest cut by the sword ineffective.
<>Ji1vahara lost many swords without Na1ga1rjuna getting
<>even a small scratch on his neck. The hubbub brought
<>the King to the scene and he immediately asked Na1ga1r-
<>juna to withdraw his head but Na1ga1rjuna refused saying,
<>“Oh, King, in my ninetynine previous births I have
<>offered my head like this and please do not ask me to
<>desist from making this offer for the hundredth time”. [Page183-b+ 65]
<>So saying he embraced the King and taking a powder
<>from his body smeared it on the sword and asked Ji1va-
<>hara to strike again. This time very easily Ji1vahara
<>severed the head from the body of Na1ga1rjuna. The
<>King was greatly aggrieved and he renounced all and
<>went to the forest and led a pious life.
<NI>Cira1yus' son Ji1vahara became King. But Na1ga1rjuna's
<>sons killed him and his mother died of grief. (Taran3ga,
<>Ratnaprabha1 Lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>CI1RIN2I. A river. It was on the banks of this river that
<>Vaivasvata Manu clad in bark-skin and with knotted
<>hair did penance. (S4loka 6, Chapter 187, Vana Parva).
<HI>CITAL. (Termites). Cital has got its own place in the
<>pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata has the following story about
<>the origin of it.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u once looking at the face of Laks2mi1 laughed
<>without any apparent reason. Laks2mi1, thinking that
<>Vis2n2u was laughing at her and that he had an eye on
<>some other woman more beautiful than her lost her
<>temper and cursed Vis2n2u that his head would be severed
<>from his body.
<NI>No sooner was the curse pronounced than the asuras came
<>in batches fully armed and challenged Vis2n2u to war.
<>Single-handed the Lord fought the asuras with one bow.
<>The fight did not end though it continued for thousands
<>of years. Vis2n2u felt tired and decided to rest awhile.
<>He planted one end of the untied bow on the ground,
<>rested his chin on the other and sat in Padma1sana.
<>Being very tired the Lord remained asleep for a long
<>time in this posture.
<NI>About this time the devas made preparations to perform
<>a yajn5a. All the devas except Maha1vis2n2u attended that
<>yajn5a. Since he was the master of yajn5as performed for
<>purposes of the devas they could not begin it in his
<>absence. So, Brahma1 and others went in search
<>of Vis2n2u to Vaikun2t2ha. But he was not to be found there.
<>Then Brahma1 and others found out with their
<>eyes of knowledge where Vis2n2u was and they went to
<>the place where he was sleeping. They waited there
<>for a long time, yet Vis2n2u did not awake from sleep.
<>Then Brahma1 hit at a plan to awaken Vis2n2u. It was
<>to create citals (termites) to eat the end of the bow.
<>When they had eaten away the end of the bow
<>planted on the ground the cord binding the two ends
<>of it would break, the bow would straighten up and the
<>speedy movement of it would awaken Vis2n2u.
<NI>According to this plan Brahma1 created citals, but his
<>other plans were not acceptable to the citals. They
<>argued that the advantage of awakening the Lord from
<>sleep would go only to the devas, while its sin would
<>fall upon them.
<NI>They argued,
<Poem>Nidra1bhan3gah2 katha1chedo
<>Dampatyoh2 pri1tibhedanam /
<>S4is4uma1tr2vibhedas4ca
<>Brahmahatya1samam3 smr2tam //</Poem>
<F>*) To disturb one in sleep, to interrupt a story, to separate husband and wife as also mother and child from each other--these things
<>are tantamount to Brahmahatya1 (killing of the brahmin).</F>
<>Brahma1 conceded the justness of this argument and
<>agreed that, in future, a part of the result of yajn5as
<>shall go to citals. It was after this that havis (sa crificial
<>offering) which, in the course of being submitted to the
<>fire falls on the sides of the pit of fire became the share
<>of citals (termites). This promise of Brahma1 pleased the
<>the citals, and they did as was bidden by Brahma1 and [Page184-a+ 65]
<>the bow of Vis2n2u straightened up with a terrific sound.
<>The devas were terror-stricken, the whole universe
<>shook, the earth experienced a convulsion and the oceans

<>severed from the body, rose high up in the sky and fell
<>into the sea. Brahma1, S4iva and others opened their eyes
<>only to find the body of Vis2n2u lying thus without the
<>head.
<NI>This loss of Vis2n2u's head proved to be useful in another
<>way. Now, Hayagri1va, after securing the boon from
<>Brahma1 that he would be killed only by one with horse's
<>head, was running rough-shod over the whole earth.
<>The devas cut off the head of a horse and attached it to
<>the trunk of Vis2n2u. Thus Vis2n2u came to life again, and
<>according to his orders the citals gnawed away the cord
<>of Hayagri1va's bow as a result of which he was killed.

<HI>CITRA1N3GADA1 III. Daughter of Vis4vakarma1. Once
<>while she was bathing in a pond along with her compa-
<>nions in the forest of Naimis4a Prince Suratha, son of
<>Sudeva, came that way. Seeing him Citra1n3gada1 told her
<>companions “This beautiful young man is in love. I
<>must give myself to him”. Though her companions
<>objected to her doing this, waving aside the objections
<>Citra1n3gada1 approached Suratha.
<NI>When Vis4vakarma1 knew about this he was extremely
<>angry and cursed her saying that she would never have
<>a marriage. Citra1n3gada1 fainted when she heard the
<>curse and her companions tried their best to wake her
<>up, but failed. They then took her to be dead and left
<>the place in search of firewood and other things to
<>conduct a funeral.
<NI>When Citra1n3gada1 woke up she looked around for her
<>companions and finding none including her lover, the
<>prince, she ran and threw herself into the river, Sarasvati1. [Page186-a+ 64]
<>That river pushed her down to river Gomati1 and that
<>river in turn washed her ashore a huge forest. There
<>she was met by the sage R2tadhvaja. Knowing her

<>dharva.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Citraratha was the gandharva son of
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife Muni. (S4loka 43, Chapter
<>65, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Citraratha and Arjuna.%} The greatest event in the
<>life of Citraratha alias An3ga1raparn2a was the defeat he
<>suffered at the hands of Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas after
<>their escape from the lac palace (La1ks2a1gr2ha) through
<>a tunnel arrived in a forest and there they killed the
<>demons Hid2im3ba and Baka. One night they were
<>walking along the shores of the river Gan3ga1 when they
<>heard a sound of somebody bathing in the river. Arjuna
<>who was walking ahead waving a country torch went
<>to see who was bathing at that time of the night. Arjuna
<>then saw Citraratha enjoying a bath with his wife
<>Kumbhi1nasi1. That period of the night was allotted to
<>the gandharvas, and human beings were not expected
<>to be out walking at that time. Citraratha felt it
<>impertinent that Arjuna a human being should be out
<>walking at night and peep into the privacy of the
<>gandharvas. The gandharva and Arjuna so entered into
<>a combat. Citraratha who was a great fighter was,
<>after a grim battle, subdued, bound hand and foot, and
<>brought before his brothers by Arjuna. Kumbhi1nasi1
<>followed her exhausted, powerless and spiritless husband
<>and pleaded to Dharmaputra to release him. Dharma-
<>putra advised Arjuna to do so and on getting his release
<>he taught Arjuna the famous Ca1ks2us2i1vidya1--the magic
<>art of seeing by one's own eyes anything and everything
<>in the three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether-
<>world. Manu was the author of this magic art and from
<>him Soma learnt it and from Soma Vis4va1vasu, from
<>Vis4va1vasu, Citraratha and from Citraratha, Arjuna.
<>Besides this Citraratha gave Arjuna many chariots
<>and horses.
<NI>In return Arjuna taught him the secret of the missile
<>Agnis4ira. Exchanging faith and affection thus Citraratha
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas became friends. He then narrated to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas many interesting stories, of which the
<>following are a few. The story of the feud between
<>Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra, story of Tapati1sam3varan2a
<>and tales about the sage Para1s4ara, Kalma1s2apa1da,
<>Adr2s4yanti1, Bha1rgavas, Kr2tavi1rya and Aurva. Citra-
<>ratha advised the Pa1n2d2avas to have a priest for the
<>sacrificial rites and it was thus that they engaged
<>Dhaumya as their family priest.
<NI>Since Arjuna had destroyed all the chariots belonging to
<>Citraratha, the latter got a name ‘Bhagnaratha’ (devoid
<>of chariots). Citraratha admitted that Arjuna could [Page186-b+ 65]
<>conquer him because of his vow of celibacy. (Chapters
<>165 to 183, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}

<NI>(3) He offered as a gift to Dharmaputra four hundred
<>excellent horses which could fly like wind. (Chapter 52,
<>S4loka 23, Vana Parva).
<NI>(4) When the gandharvas milked the earth during the
<>time of the emperor, Pr2thu, Citraratha acted as the calf.

<>He was the son of Us4an3ku and father of S4u1ra. (S4loka 29,
<>Chapter 147, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>CITRARATHA VIII. Son of Vi1raba1hu and a friend of
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma. In the Ra1jya Ka1n2d2a of A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a
<>there is the following story about him.
<NI>Citraratha was also one among those assembled for the
<>svayam3vara of Hema1, daughter of Kus4a. He sent an
<>anaesthetic missile to the assemblage and made them
<>all fall down senseless. He then took Hema1 out from the
<>marriage hall. But on reaching outside he felt he had
<>done a very unjust thing and so withdrew the missile
<>and stood outside ready to fight. A fight ensued in
<>which Citraratha defeated all. But Lava alone continued
<>to fight with him. Vi1raba1hu, father of Citraratha, who
<>was closely watching the fight came to the help of Citra-
<>ratha and engaging Lava in a fight struck him down.
<>Kus4a seeing this attacked Vi1raba1hu and bound him
<>hand and foot. At that time S4ri1 Ra1ma came to the scene
<>and told Kus4a that Vi1raba1hu was a friend of his and
<>set Vi1raba1hu free. Hema1 was then married to Citra-
<>ratha and Vi1raba1hu was sent away with due respect.
<HI>CITRARATHA. An Indian river of pura1n2ic fame.

<HI>CITRAS4ARA1SANA. (S4ARA1SANA, CITRACA1PA). One
<>of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. In the great battle he was
<>killed by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 20, Chapter 136, Dron2a
<>Parva).
<HI>CITRASENA I. A gandharva. There is reference to
<>this gandharva in many places in the pura1n2as. He had
<>two wives Sandhya1vali1 and Ratna1vali1.
<NI>1) {%How Arjuna saved him.%} Once when Citrasena with
<>his wives was travelling in the aerial car the spittings of
<>Citrasena fell upon the sage Ga1lava who was doing his
<>sandhya1 rites then. The sage complained about the
<>incident to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who promised to bring to him the
<>head of Citrasena before sun-set. Sage Na1rada informed
<>Citrasena of this vow of Kr2s2n2a. The gandharva was
<>taken aback and did not know what to do. But Sandhya1-
<>vali1 and Ratna1vali1 went and sought the help of Subhadra1.
<>They made a fire pit in front of her house and decided
<>to end their lives along with Citrasena by jumping into
<>the fire. While Citrasena was circling the fire-pit be-
<>fore jumping into it his wives wept loudly and hearing
<>the noise Subhadra1 came out and saw what was happen-
<>ing. They then took from Subhadra1 a boon to the effect
<>that they should be allowed to live with their husband.
<>It was only after granting them the boon that Subhadra1
<>understood the whole situation. Subhadra1 was in a
<>fix but Arjuna assured her that Citrasena would be
<>protected at any cost. Arjuna very cleverly shielded all
<>the arrows sent against the gandharva by Kr2s2n2a and
<>gradually the fight came to be one between Arjuna and
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Subhadra1 came between them and it was
<>found difficult to continue the fight. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a advised
<>Citrasena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava.
<>Citrasena obeyed and the issue settled without harm to
<>both the parties.
<NI>2) {%Arjuna defeats Citrasena.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>in exile, Duryodhana knew through a spy that they
<>were camping in the Dvaitavana forest. Prompted by
<>Karn2a Duryodhana programmed to go to Dvaitavana
<>with his retinue to enjoy the sight of the suffering Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas. So they started to the forests under a pretext of an
<>annual stock-taking of the cows. They reached Dvaita-
<>vana with a huge army. There they split into parties
<>and roamed about making merry by themselves. Soon
<>one of the parties reached a pond near the hermitage of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. They saw a few gandharvas making
<>merry in the pond. With the usual haughtiness they
<>commanded the gandharvas to leave the pond and make
<>room for Duryodhana to come and bathe. The gandhar-
<>vas did not pay heed to their words and on being inform-
<>ed of this Duryodhana went to fight with the gandhar-
<>vas. It was Citrasena who led the gandharvas and by
<>his incessant shower of piercing arrows split the Kaurava
<>forces and made them flee for life. Duryodhana was
<>isolated from his army, was bound hand and foot and
<>taken a prisoner. In their sheer helplessness they approa-
<>ched Dharmaputra in his hermitage and acquainted
<>him with the pitiable plight of Duryodhana. Dharma-
<>putra asked Arjuna to go to the help of the Kauravas.
<>Arjuna faced Citrasena in a grim combat. Citrasena
<>then appeared in his real form and Arjuna knew that
<>he was fighting a friend. Then at the request of Arjuna
<>Citraratha released Duryodhana. (Chapters 239 to
<>243, Vana Parva).

<HI>COLA. A very righteous emperor of Ka1n5ci1pura. Be-
<>cause of the virtuous rule of this emperor his country
<>got the name Cola. There is an interesting story in
<>Padma Pura1n2a of how the emperor attained Vaikun2-
<>t2haloka (The abode of Maha1vis2n2u).
<NI>Once Cola went to Vaikun2t2ha to worship Maha1vis2n2u.
<>As he was worshipping him with pearls and flowers
<>of gold a brahmin subject of his came there to worship
<>him with water and Tulasi1 leaves. The simple offer-
<>ing of Tulasi1 leaves and flowers by this brahmar2s2i, Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa, eclipsed the expensive one by the King and the
<>latter was greatly offended and he rebuked the Brahmin
<>saying that he was a poor man who did not know what
<>devotion to Vis2n2u was. But Vis2n2uda1sa did not take
<>the taunt unchallenged. He asked the king to wait
<>and see who would merge with the glowing entity of
<>the Lord earlier.
<NI>The King on returning to his palace started a Vais2n2ava-
<>sattra. (An almonry dedicated to Maha1vis2n2u). This
<>almshouse was as comfortable and luxurious as the
<>one once started by Brahma1 in the temple of Gaya.
<>Vis2n2uda1sa on the other hand spent his life in a Vis2n2u
<>temple leading a celibate life and observing rites pleas-
<>ing to Vis2n2u.
<NI>One day after finishing his daily morning rites Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa cooked his food as usual and kept it in its place
<>to be taken later. But on returning to it after some
<>time he found his food eaten by someone else. He
<>went without food that day and it happened the next
<>day also. It continued to happen thus for a week and
<>all these days Vis2n2uda1sa went fasting. Vis2n2uda1sa
<>then decided to watch and see who the thief was.
<>On keeping a vigil he found a Can2d2a1la (a harijan of
<>the lowest Cadre) timidly coming and grabbing at
<>the food with gluttonous greed to appease his hunger.
<>Seeing the famished skeletonous body of the thief Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa felt compassion rather than resentment and calling
<>him back to take the food went after him crying “Hi,
<>come here and take this ghee also with you. That food
<>has no fat in it.” But the Gan2d2a1la frightened at the
<>sight of the owner of the food ran away as fast as his
<>legs could carry him, Vis2n2uda1sa following him. But
<>soon the Can2d2a1la fell fainting on the road exhausted and
<>tired. Vis2n2uda1sa reaching his side started fanning him
<>with his cloth. Very soon the Can2d2a1la changed
<>himself into Maha1vis2n2u adorned with S4am3kha, Cakra
<>and Gada1 and Vis2n2u embracing his devotee took him
<>to Vaikun2t2ha.
<NI>Hearing this Cola called Mudgala the priest of the
<>Vais2n2avasattra, to his side and lamented “I started
<>this sattra to spite Vis2n2uda1sa and now he has gone to [Page189-a+ 65]
<>Vaikun2t2ha. It was due to his true devotion to God
<>that he has attained salvation. What we have done
<>is of no use.” So saying he crowned his nephew as
<>King. Even while young he had become an ascetic and as
<>such had no sons. From that time the crowning of
<>the nephew as King became a precedent in Cola.
<>Renouncing the kingdom Cola went to the sacrificial
<>hall and circling the sacrificial fire stood before it and
<>addressing Mukunda said “Oh Vis2n2u, grant me un-
<>wavering devotion to you in thought, speech and deed.”
<>Repeating this three times the king jumped into the
<>fire. At this Mudgala, the priest, burst into anger and
<>tore off the lock of hair on his head. So even today
<>the decendants of Mudgala do not have hair-locks.
<>Vis2n2u who is always affectionate to his devotees graci-
<>ously appeared from the sacrificial fire and embraced
<>the King. The King was then taken to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Chapters 110, 111, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>COLA(M3). The three celebrated kingdoms of South-

<HI>CU1DA1MA. I. See under Sita1.
<HI>CU1LI. A sage. Once Somada1, daughter of a gandharva
<>women U1rmila1, looked after this sage and well pleased
<>with her service he asked her what she wanted and

<>Each got a different substance and what the Na1gas got
<>was poison. They milked the poison into a pot-like
<>Curaykka1.
<HI>CU1T2U. (Dice). It is an imaginative paura1n2ic assump-
<>tion that there is a satanic force latent in dice, hunting,
<>wine and women. There is a story to support the pre-
<>sence of this evil power within the above four. Indra
<>once turned the As4vini1devas out of his court labelling
<>them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discon-
<>tented at this the As4vini1devas approached Cyavana and
<>the latter performing a ya1ga invited the As4vini1devas and
<>gave them the ya1ga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this
<>Indra raised his celebrated Vajra1yudha (Weapon of
<>thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic
<>powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from
<>the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra.
<>Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana
<>and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into
<>four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine
<>and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as
<>destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>CYAVANA. A celebrated sage of the Bha1rgava dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Brahma1--
<>Bhr2gu--Cyavana.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Bhr2gu is the son of Brahma1 born of Agni at the
<>Brahmayajn5a conducted by Varun2a. The beautiful and
<>virtuous lady Puloma1 was the wife of Bhr2gu. Even be-
<>fore Bhr2gu married her she was being loved by the demon
<>Puloma1 and her marriage with Bhr2gu embittered him
<>and he waited for an opportunity to kidnap Puloma1.
<NI>One day when Bhr2gu went to the river for his bath
<>Puloma1 entered the a1s4rama and there he found his love
<>Puloma1 being watched over by Agni. Puloma1 compelled
<>Agni to tell him the truth whether Bhr2gu had married
<>Puloma1 according to the rites enjoined by the scriptures.
<>Agni confessed that it was not so and then Puloma1
<>taking the shape of a hog carried away Puloma1 who was
<>then in a stage of advanced pregnancy. On the way the
<>wife of the sage delivered and the babe dropped to the
<>ground. Because the babe was born with a fall (Cyavana)
<>from the womb the boy was named Cyavana. The
<>radiance of the boy burnt the demon into ashes. Puloma1
<>weeping profusely with tears rolling down her cheeks
<>returned to the a1s4rama. Her tears ran into a river and the
<>river got the name Vadhu1sara1 Bhr2gu on knowing how all
<>happened cursed Agni saying that Agni would thereafter
<>be an all-round eater. (eating anything and everything).
<>(Chapters 5 and 6, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Penance and marriage.%} Even when he was very
<>young Cyavana commenced practising austerities.
<>He went to the forests and sat in meditation without food
<>or sleep, oblivious to what happened outside. Years went
<>by and Cyavana did not stir from his place. Gradually
<>earth began to cover him and soon he was completely
<>enveloped by earth. Creepers grew on it and birds made
<>rests; Cyavana did not know anything about it. [Page190-a+ 65]
<>One day S4arya1ti with his wives and children came to
<>that forest for a picnic. Sukanya1, daughter of King
<>S4arya1ti, along with her companions separated from the
<>King and roamed about in the forest making merry.
<>They soon came to the place where Cyavana sat doing
<>penance. There was an unusual radiance around the
<>heap of earth they saw there and Sukanya1 out of curiosity
<>started striking down the earth. Then from inside came
<>Cyavana's voice advising her not to crumble down the
<>earth as she was doing. Sukanya1 ignored the advice and
<>searched for the source of the voice. She then saw two
<>points of glow and taking a thorn gave two pricks at
<>those points and left the place with her companions.
<NI>Those glow-points were the eyes of Cyavana and Cya-
<>vana felt insufferable pain when his eyes were thus pierced
<>through. But he neither became angry nor cursed the
<>girl who did this havoc. Cyavana went on with his
<>penance. But soon the country of S4arya1ti began to expe-
<>rience the bad effects of this evil-deed. People one by one
<>in the beginning and then the whole lot were disabled
<>from passing either urine or faeces. From men and
<>women the disease spread to the animals also. The country
<>was in a chaos and the subjects flocked to the palace to
<>complain to the King. S4arya1ti knew that somebody must
<>have in a some way tormented Cyavana and enquired
<>of each and everyone of his subjects. Whether anybody
<>had knowingly or unknowingly given pain to Cyavana.
<>Nobody had done so and the King was worried. Then
<>Sukanya1 ran to her father and confessed what she had
<>done. The King ran immediately to the place where
<>Cyavana was doing penance and striking down the earth
<>prostrated before the sage who was sitting there sad and
<>miserable. The King apologised to Cyavana and reques-
<>ted him to pardon his daughter.
<NI>Cyavana then told the King that it was enough if he
<>gave his daughter in marriage to him in expiation of the
<>harm done. The King was shocked to hear this for
<>Cyavana was not only ugly but now blind also. The
<>King returned to the palace sad and worried and there
<>was gloom over the whole palace. But Sukanya1 approa-
<>ched her father and agreed to be the wife of Cyavana.
<>The problem was solved and the King with great reluc-
<>tance took his daughter to the forests and gave her in
<>marriage to Cyavana.
<NI>4) {%Cyavana attains eternal youth.%} It was the time when
<>Indra had banned Somapa1na (drinking of the ya1ga wine)
<>to the As4vini1devas. Discontented at this they roamed
<>about in the forests and soon came to the neighbourhood
<>of the a1s4rama of Cyavana.
<NI>Sukanya1 after becoming the wife of Cyavana did all she
<>could to make her husband comfortable and happy.
<>She would collect very sweet and tasty fruit from the
<>forests and give him. She would bathe him in hot water.
<>After arranging all the materials needed for the morning
<>rites like yava, sesame, darbha and water, she would
<>take her husband to the place of the pu1ja1 leading him
<>by hand. When the morning pu1ja1 was over she would
<>seat him in a suitable place and give him rice and fruits.
<>After the meals she would give him pan to chew. Only
<>after doing all these would she go to do her daily rites
<>and that too only after obtaining her husband's permis-
<>sion. She would finish her routine in no time to come
<>back to her husband to see whether he was in need of
<>anything. Then she would make arrangements for the
<>evening pu1ja1 and after the pu1ja1 was over she would give [Page190-b+ 65]
<>him his dinner. She would eat only what was left by
<>her husband. At night she would spread a soft bedding
<>and lull him to sleep. Then she would take a nap lying
<>at the foot of her husband. During summer she would
<>fan him and during winter she would make fire to give
<>him heat. Early morning she would take him to a dis-
<>tant place for his excretion and after washing him would
<>seat him in a suitable place for cleaning his teeth and
<>face. Then the routine would start with great devotion
<>again.
<NI>One day Sukanya1 was returning from the river after her
<>bath and on the way she came across the As4vini1devas.
<>They were astounded to see such a beautiful damsel in
<>the forest and they accosted her and requested her to
<>select one of them as her husband. Knowing her identity
<>they advised her to forsake her old and blind husband and
<>come and live with one of them. She flew into a fury
<>when she heard her husband spoken of so slightingly
<>and by logical argument convinced them the error of
<>their request. Then they told her thus: “You are aware
<>we are the physicians of the devas. We can give back
<>eyesight to your husband and make him as beautiful
<>as one of us. We will then appear before you as three
<>lovely young men identical in appearance and then you
<>must select one among the three as your husband.”
<NI>Sukanya1 was immensely pleased as well as surprised to
<>hear the offer and was eager to see her husband young
<>and beautiful. But the last condition frightened her.
<>Anyhow she promised to give a reply after consulting her
<>husband and ran to the a1s4rama to tell her husband the
<>news. Cyavana advised her to accept the offer of the
<>As4vini1devas and Sukanya1 ran back to the As4vini1devas
<>and brought them to her husband accepting their terms.
<>The As4vini1devas took the aged and blind Cyavana along
<>with them to the river nearby and the three plunged into
<>the river. When they rose up after a dip the three emer-
<>ged as young, lovely and charming triplets difficult to be
<>distinguished from one another. When Sukanya1 stood
<>before the three to select her real husband she prayed to
<>her goddess and the Devi1 gave her the power to identify
<>Cyavana and so she correctly chose him from the three.
<>(Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Cyavana defeated Indra.%} Immensely pleased at re-
<>gaining his eyesight and youth Cyavana asked the As4vini1-
<>devas what they wanted. The As4vini1devas replied that
<>Indra had banned wine to them and they would like to
<>have the ban lifted. Cyavana Mahars2i immediately
<>commenced a Somaya1ga to which were invited all the
<>devas and the As4vini1devas also. When Indra saw the
<>As4vini1devas standing to partake of the Soma wine he was
<>furious and objected to the wine being given to them.
<>Cyavana dissented and a fight ensued between Indra and
<>Cyavana. Indra raised his weapon ‘Vajra1yudha’ to
<>strike at Cyavana and then Cyavana made all his limbs
<>go stiff. He then raised from the sacrificial fire a fiendish
<>demon called Mada to kill the devas. All those present
<>were frightened by this demon and they ran away. But
<>Indra could not run for his limbs were stiff. Standing
<>there he prayed to his preceptor Br2haspati for help and
<>Br2haspati advised Indra to surrender to Cyavana. Indra
<>bowed his head before Cyavana and prayed to be ex-
<>cused. Cyavana was pleased and withdrawing the demon
<>tore him into four pieces and threw one each into Dice,
<>Hunting, Wine and Women. The devas and As4vini1devas
<>then went back to heaven. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 [Page191-a+ 64]
<>Bha1gavata. R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 17, Su1kta
<>116; Chapter 123, Vana Parva).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Paras4ura1ma once came and stayed at the a1s4rama of
<>Cyavana. At that time Bhr2gu and Cyavana were in the
<>a1s4rama. They blessed him and advised him to go to
<>Kaila1sa and do penance there to propitiate S4iva. It was
<>thus that Paras4ura1ma happened to go to Kaila1sa to do
<>penance there. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 62).
<NI>(2) Cyavana got a son named Pramati. This Pramati
<>was the father of Ruru and the grandfather of S4unaka.
<>(Chapter 5, A1di Parva).
<NI>(3) Cyavana married A1rus2i daughter of Manu. Aurva
<>was the son born to A1rus2i from her thigh. In descending
<>order from Aurva were born R2ci1ka--Jamadagni--
<>Paras4ura1ma. (Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<NI>(4) A1sti1ka learnt Sa1n3ga Vedas from the a1s4rama
<>of Cyavana. (Chapter 48, A1di Parva).
<NI>(5) Cyavana was the guru of Bhi1s2ma. (S4loka 11,
<>Chapter 37, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(6) King Yuvana1s4va once went to the a1s4rama of Cyavana
<>greatly worried over the lack of a descendant. Cyavana
<>prepared some sacred water made potent with the recital
<>of mantras to induce gestation and kept it there. Acci-
<>dentally the King drank that water and got pregnant.
<>The pregnancy developed without miscarriage and in due
<>time the King gave birth to a child, the left side of his
<>stomach bursting forth to push out the child. It was this
<>child who became Ma1ndha1ta1. (Chapter 126, Vana
<>Parva).
<NI>(7) Cyavana was a brilliant member of the court of
<>Brahma1. (S4loka 11, Chapter 22, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(8) Cyavana went to Pa1ta1la (nether-world). (See under
<>Kekaralohita).
<NI>(9) Once the august Vedas4arma1 of Kaus4i1kagotra went
<>to the a1s4rama of Cyavana lost in thought. Cyavana recei-
<>ved him with due respect and enquired about the reason
<>for his sorrow. Vedas4arma1 then told him that the lack of a
<>son worried him much. Cyavana then blessed him and
<>assured him of a child soon. (Chapter 14, Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>(10) Cyavana had a daughter named Sumanas and she
<>was married to a sage called Somas4arma1. (Chapter 14,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CYAVANA1S4RAMA. A sacred place. Am3ba1, daughter
<>of Ka1s4ira1ja, used to bathe in a pond nearby. (S4loka 26,
<>Chapter 186, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>CYAVANASAROVARAM. A sacred place. It is believ-
<>ed that this is the best place for worshipping Pitr2s
<>(spirits of the dead). (S4loka 11, Chapter 125, Vana
<>Parva).
<H>D
<HI>D. ({#qa#}) This letter means (1) Rudra and (2) tremor
<>or fear (tra1sa).
<HI>DA. This syllable means ruin. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>348).
<HI>DABHI1TI. A hermit who is praised much in the R2g-
<>veda. It is mentioned in R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka
<>16, Su1kta 112, that the As4vini1devas had saved Turvi1ti,
<>Dabhi1ti, Dhvasanti and Purus2anti, the sons of Indra,
<>from a danger.
<HI>DADHI1CA. (DADHI1CI).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} A famous hermit. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that
<>this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhr2gu, and [Page191-b+ 64]
<>that he was made of the essences of the world, with a
<>huge body.
<NI>2) {%The birth of the hermit Sa1rasvata.%} Dadhi1ca erected his
<>hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvati1 and began
<>to do penance. The power of penance increased daily.
<>Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial
<>maid Alam3bus2a1 to break the penance of Dadhi1ca some-
<>how or other. Alam3bus2a1 came to the hermitage of
<>Dadhi1ca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit
<>saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred
<>to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvati1, who be-
<>came pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child.
<>She took the child to the hermit Dadhi1ca and told him
<>the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased.
<>He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river
<>Sarasvati1 thus:--
<NI>“Brahma1, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased
<>if your water is offered as oblation.”
<NI>Dadhi1ci then said that the child should be named Sa1ras-
<>vata. He also added that when there was a drought conti-
<>nuously for twelve years, Sa1rasvata would have the
<>power to bring rain. Then Sarasvati1 took the child to
<>her abode and brought it up.
<NI>3) {%How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.%} Once
<>Dadhi1ci went to the world of the devas (gods).
<>From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with
<>the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could
<>not. So he made a search for anything left behind by
<>Dadhi1ca. He understood that Dadhi1ca had with him
<>the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country
<>of S4aran2ya. With the bones taken from that head Indra
<>and Dadhi1ca destroyed a large number of asuras.
<>(R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 13, Su1kta 84).
<NI>4) {%The weapon%} (Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone.
<>A story occurs in the Maha1bha1rata, which says that the
<>Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of
<>Dadhi1ci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the
<>leadership of Vr2ttra1sura. Indra tried his utmost to kill
<>Vr2ttra1sura, but he could not. At last Indra approached
<>Brahma1, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit,
<>called Dadhi1ca was obtained it could effectively be used
<>against Vr2tra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara
<>and Na1ra1yan2a to the banks of the river Sarasvati1 and
<>entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining
<>hermit Dadhi1ca and informed him of their errand. The
<>hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his
<>bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded
<>his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhi1ci and made his
<>weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vr2tra
<>and his followers. (Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 100).
<NI>5) {%Other information%}
<NI>(1) At the sacrifice of Daks2a, Dadhi1ci got angry because
<>S4iva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 284).
<NI>(2) Once Dadhi1ci talked to a Bra1hmin called Karun2a
<>about the importance of the ashes dedicated to S4iva.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 101).
<NI>(3) See Dhanan5jaya V to know how this hermit gave
<>absolution from curse to a fly.
<HI>DADHI1CA(M). A holy place in Kuruks2etra. An3giras
<>the son of Sarasvati1 was born in this place. From that
<>day onwards this place became a holy place. It is men-
<>tioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83,
<>Stanza 186 that he who bathes in this holy place will [Page192-a+ 66]
<>obtain the fruits of performing the sacrifice As4vamedha,
<>and enter the world of Sarasvati1.
<HI>DADHIMAN2D2ODAKA. An ocean. This ocean is near the
<>ocean Ghr2toda samudra (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 12, Stanza 2).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA I. A famous serpent, born to Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati by his wife Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 35, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA II. A famous monkey. This old mon-
<>key was the general of a huge monkey-army. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<>283, Stanza 7 that this general approached S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>once, with his army.
<HI>DADHIVA1HANA. An ancient king of Bha1rata. The
<>hermit Gautama saved the son of this King from the
<>attack of Paras4ura1ma (Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 49, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIVAKTRA. A monkey who helped S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>It is seen in Adhya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 5, as follows:--
<NI>“Dadhimukhah2 Kruddhasugri1vasya ma1tulah2”. From
<>this it is understood that Dadhimukha or Dadhiva-
<>ktra was the uncle of Sugri1va. (For further infor-
<>mation see Madhuvana).
<HI>DADHYAN3.
<F>1) The stories regarding the two hermits Dadhici and Dadhyan3 in the Pura1n2as are not very clear. In Maha1 bha1rata Dadhi1ca is men-
<>tioned as the son of Bhr2gu, and in R2gveda it occurs that Dadhi1ca was the son of Hermit Atharva who was the son of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Moreover the story of Dadhyan3 teaching the As4vini1devas the ‘Madhuvidya1’ is connected with Dadhici in some other pura1nas
<>Some statements in the R2gveda make it difficult to assume that both Dadhyan3 and Dadhi1ci are one and the same person. So relving
<>on the majority of statements in the various pura1n2as this book has accepted the fact that these hermits are separate persons and that
<>Dadhi1ci was the son of Bhr2gu whereas the hermit who taught Madhuvidya1 to the As4vini1devas was Dadhyan3.</F> A hermit. Once Indra taught this
<>hermit Madhuvidya1 (the art of mead) Indra told the
<>hermit that his head would be cut off if he taught any-
<>body this art. The As4vini1devas approached Dadhyan3
<>to learn this art. Fearing Indra the hermit refused to
<>teach them the art. As4vini1devas cut off his head and
<>buried it in a place. Then they cut off the head of a
<>horse and fixed it on the neck of Dadhyan3. Having
<>the head of the horse he taught the art to the As4vini1-
<>devas. When Dadhyan3 had finished teaching, they
<>took away the head of the horse and fixed his own
<>head in place. (R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka, 17,
<>Su1kta 166).
<HI>DAHA I. One of the eleven Rudras. He was the grand-
<>son of Brahma1 and the son of Stha1n2u. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 3).
<HI>DAHA II. An attendant given to Subrahman2ya by
<>Am3s4a, a god. (Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>45, Stanza 34).
<HI>DAHADAHA1. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 20).
<HI>DAHATI. A warrior given to Subrahman2ya by god
<>Am3s4a. Mention is made about this warrior in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 34.
<HI>DAIVA I. Almighty God. (See I1s4vara).
<HI>DAIVA II. A kind of marriage. The form of marriage
<>by which one gives his daughter to a priest. (See
<>Viva1ha).
<HI>DAIVA1LI1KA. A country. Mention is made in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 18, that
<>the King and the people of Daiva1li1ka were present
<>on the occasion of the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya (imperial
<>consecration) of Yudhis2t2hira.
<HI>DAIVASAM3PATTI. The virtues of those who are
<>born of a noble family.
<NI>“He Bharata ! Security, knowledge of tattvas the desire [Page192-b+ 60]
<>to attain harmony with the Supreme Being by the know-
<>ledge of Brahman, alms-giving, self restraint, perform-
<>ing sacrifice, self-study, penance, sincerity, truth, libe-
<>rality, continence, kindness, mildness, modesty, resolu-
<>tion, cleanliness, forgiveness, brightness, abstaining
<>from committing murder and getting angry, having
<>no malignity, covetousness, fickleness and pride and
<>not injuring others are the Daivasam3patti or good
<>qualities of a noble man.” (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 40).
<HI>DAITYADI1PA. One of the sons of Garud2a. Mention
<>is made about Daityadi1pa in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 101, Stanza 11.
<HI>DAITYASENA1. Sister of Devasena1, the wife of Subrah-
<>man2ya. Kes4i, an asura, married her. (For detailed
<>story, see Devasena1).
<HI>D2A1KINI. A class of women supposed to be proficient
<>in magic and the performance of feats with the help
<>of mantras. (See Ks2uraka).
<HI>DAKS2A.
<NI>1) {%Two Daks2as.%} In most of the Pura1n2as references
<>about two Daks2as occur. In some pura1n2as both are
<>referred to as one and the same person, whereas in
<>some others both are considered as separate persons,
<>so much so the stories concerning both are interlocked
<>and entangled very often. The fact is that there was
<>only one Daks2a, whose life was of two stages. The first
<>Daks2a was killed at the sacrifice of Daks2a, at which point,
<>ends the first stage, or the first Daks2a. The second stage
<>was the rebirth of the same Daks2a. A short biography
<>of Daks2a including both stages is given below:--
<NI>Brahma1 created by his mind, the seven great hermits,
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha and
<>Kratu. So these seven hermits are called the Ma1nasa-
<>putras (sons born from mind) of Brahma1. After this,
<>from the anger of Brahma1, Rudra was born, and from
<>his lap Na1rada, from his right thumb Daks2a, from
<>his mind the Sanakas and from his left thumb a daughter
<>named Vi1ran2i1 were born.
<Poem>Vi1ran2i1 na1ma tasya1 stu
<>asikni1tya1pi sattama1</Poem>
<NI>From this passage which occurs in Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a it
<>may be assumed that ‘Asikni1’ was another name of
<>Vi1ran2i1. Daks2a did penance in the mountain of Vindhya
<>for a long time. It is mentioned in Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>8, that Maha1vis2n2u appeared before Daks2a and gave
<>him Asikni1 as his wife.
<NI>Several sons were born to Daks2a by his wife Asikni1.
<>The last one was a daughter named Sati1 who became
<>the wife of S4iva. At this time Daks2a performed a sacrifice.
<>As he was not invited to that sacrifice, S4iva sent
<>Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1 and killed Daks2a. Though
<>the devas put the head of a goat in place of the lost
<>head and brought Daks2a to life again, no reference
<>is made about the life of Daks2a after the sacrifice. Thus
<>the first stage of the life of Daks2a ends. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 7).
<NI>After this, once the Pracetases (the ten sons of Barhis)
<>were engaged in penance and the earth was not pro-
<>perly cultivated in consequence of which big trees [Page193-a+ 65]
<>grew up and the whole of the earth was changed into
<>a big forest. The sky was covered with tree tops. It
<>was difficult even for the wind to pass through them
<>and thus the forest thrived for ten thousand years. The
<>pracetases got out of the sea after penance and entered
<>the shore. When they saw the big forest they got angry
<>and the ten of them discharged fire and wind from
<>their faces. The wind up-rooted the trees and the fire
<>dried them. Thus almost the whole of the trees were
<>consumed. Then Candra, the King of the medicinal
<>herbs came there and told the Pracetases “Oh, Kings,
<>hold your anger. I will make the trees conclude a
<>treaty with you. The beautiful Ma1ris2a1 who was born
<>to the trees is my foster-daughter. I give her to you
<>as your wife. From half the portion of your minds
<>and half the portion of my mind the great and wise
<>praja1pati Daks2a is going to take birth in her womb”.
<NI>The Pracetases controlled their anger and accepted
<>Ma1ris2a1 as their wife, at the words of Somadeva (Candra)
<>and as the son of the ten pracetases the Praja1pati Daks2a
<>was born. With this the second stage of the life of Daks2a
<>begins. The important occurrences in the two stages
<>of the life of Daks2a are given below in their order.
<NI>2) {%Daks2a's creation of the prajas or subjects.%} Once Brahma1
<>called Daks2a and ordered him to create praja1s or sub-
<>jects. Accordingly Daks2a created the gods, the hermits,
<>the Gandharvas (Demi-gods), the Asuras, the serpents
<>etc. Seeing that the subjects he created were not pro-
<>liferating as required he thought of creating subjects
<>by coition of male and female; and he begot by his
<>wife Asikni1 five thousand sons, and they were called
<>Haryas4vas. They in their turn were about to create
<>subjects when Na1rada appeared before them and said
<>“Oh, Haryas4vas, you are mere children and ignorant
<>of the secrets of this world. How do you intend to
<>create subjects? You fools, since you have the power
<>to go up and down and lengthwise and breadthwise,
<>why don't you try to find out the extremities of the
<>earth?” Hearing the words of Na1rada, they all ran
<>in different directions and have not returned since.
<>Thus Daks2a lost the Haryas4vas. Daks2a again begot
<>thousand sons by Asikni1 and they were called S4abala1s4vas.
<>Seeing that they also were about to create subjects
<>Na1rada scattered them also, by some tricks. The
<>S4abala1s4vas who had gone to see the end of the earth
<>have not yet returned.
<NI>Daks2a got angry with Na1rada and cursed him thus:
<>“You also, like my children shall wander from place
<>to place all over the earth”. From that dry onwards
<>Na1rada became a wanderer, without a fixed dwelling
<>place. The wise Praja1pati Daks2a again begot sixty
<>damsels by Asikni1. Ten of the girls were given to Dharma-
<>deva, thirteen of them to Kas4yapa, twentyseven of
<>them to Soma, and four of them to Aris2t2anemi. Of
<>the rest two were given to Ba1huputra, two to An3giras
<>and two to the wise Kr2s4a1s4va. The names of the wives
<>of each are given below:--
<NI>(1) {%Kas4yapa.%} Aditi, Diti, Danu, Aris2t2a1, Surasa1, Khasa1,
<>Surabhi, Vinata1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Ira1, Kadru1,

<NI>The names of the wives given to An3giras, Aris2t2anemi,
<>Ba1huputra and Kr2s4a1s4va are not mentioned.
<NI>Besides these damsels, twentyfour daughters were born
<>to Daks2a of his wife Prasu1ti who was the sister of Utta1na-
<>pa1da. Dharmadeva married thirteen of them also, named
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,
<>Buddhi, Lajja1, Vapus, S4a1nti, Siddhi, Ki1rti. Of the rest,

<>to Pulaha, Santati to Kratu, Anasu1ya1 to Atri, U1rja1
<>to Vasis2t2ha, Sva1ha1 to Agnideva and Svadha1 to the
<>Manes. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>3) {%Sacrifice of Daks2a.%} Once Daks2a performed a sacri-
<>fice called Br2haspatisavana. To this sacrifice he did not
<>invite his daughter Sati1 or her husband S4iva. Daks2a
<>did not invite them because of three reasons according
<>to the Pura1n2as.
<NI>(1) Once Durva1sas, the son of Atri, went to Jambu1nada
<>and meditated with the mantra or spell of ‘Ma1ya1bi1ja’
<>and worshipped Jagadambika1 (mother of the
<>world) the goddess there. The goddess was much plea-
<>sed and gave him as a token of her pleasure the garland
<>of flowers she wore from which nectar was oozing.
<>Durva1sas wore it on his head and went to the palace of
<>Daks2a, the Praja1pati. When he saw such a wonderful
<>garland which was not of this world, he wanted to have
<>it and Durva1sas instantly gave it to Daks2a. He placed it in
<>a prominent place in his bedroom and enjoying the
<>wonderful fragrance of it he conjugated with his wife,
<>and polluted that pure garland by his lust. S4iva and his
<>wife came to know of this and they scolded Daks2a, who
<>kept this bitterness in his heart and when the sacrifice
<>was performed, he decided not to invite them. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>(2) S4iva was considered as a polluted man by Daks2a
<>as he had always been carrying with him the skull of
<>Brahma1 and so he thought it wrong on his part to admit
<>his daughter and son-in-law to the sacrificial hall. The
<>story of how S4iva came to have the skull, is given below.
<NI>In days of old when the whole world was under the
<>single ocean (of the great flood) the sun, the moon, the
<>fire, air everything was destroyed and darkness pre-
<>vailed. All the vegetations were destroyed. All the
<>emotions and non-emotions disappeared. The supreme
<>Lord was sleeping for so many thousands of nights
<>together. At the end of the night he assumed the attri-
<>bute of ‘Rajogun2a’ (activity) and got ready to create
<>the universe. From the face of the Supreme Lord and
<>creator of the universes came out Brahma1 with five faces.
<>In the same way, S4iva with three eyes and matted hair,
<>and trident and rosary of beads (Elaeo carpus) and with
<>attribute of ‘Tamas’ (darkness--destruction) also came
<>out. Both Brahma1 and S4iva were filled with egoism and
<>both began to quarrel with each other. It was a contest
<>as to who was greater. The contest ended in attack.
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1, when the
<>same face, flushed with anger, scolded S4iva. The head
<>fell into the hands of S4iva, who could not throw it down
<>as it didn't come off from his hand. Brahma1 cursed
<>S4iva and made him polluted. Since S4iva became polluted, [Page194-a+ 64]
<>his wife Sati1 also was considered as polluted by Daks2a.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) Once the praja1patis performed a sacrifice. Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva were present there. Daks2a, who had been
<>invited by the praja1patis also was present. When Daks2a
<>entered the hall his son-in-law S4iva did not rise up.
<>This arrogance of S4iva made Daks2a angry. Daks2a made
<>up his mind to take vengeance on S4iva, and performed
<>a sacrifice known as Br2haspatisavana. To that sacrifice
<>he did not invite S4iva or Sati1.
<NI>Hearing that her father was conducting a sacrifice Sati1
<>came uninvited. But Daks2a did not even look at her.
<>Sati1devi whose heart was broken at this treatment made
<>a fire and jumped into it and died. S4iva became furious
<>when he came to know of this. Being overwhelmed with
<>sorrow and anger he beat his matted hair on the ground,
<>from which two monsters, Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1,
<>came out. They ran to Daks2a's sacrificial hall and des-
<>troyed everything they saw, killed everybody, caught
<>hold of Daks2a and cut off his head. Then they began to
<>create havoc in the whole world. The hermits and
<>sages began to take to flight. Men and animals shivered.
<>Thus the three worlds began to tremble with fear. The
<>gods approached S4iva with supplication to curb his
<>anger. The gracious S4an3kara was pleased to recall the
<>monsters. After that everybody requested him to bring
<>Daks2a back to life. But the search made for the head of
<>Daks2a was futile. At last Brahma1 took the head of a
<>goat and joined it to the headless trunk of Daks2a. Thus
<>he was brought to life again.
<F>1. Though Daks2a was brought to life again with the head of a goat there is no mention of him again in the Pura1n2as. We hear of
<>Daks2a again as the son of Ma1ris2a1.</F> (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 7).
<NI>4) {%Cursing Candra.%} Candra had married twentyseven
<>daughters of Daks2a. But he showed particular attach-
<>ment to Rohin2i1. The other twentysix wives could not
<>bear this. They made a complaint to their father Daks2a.
<>Daks2a called Candra and advised him to show equal
<>attachment to all his wives and not to show any partia-
<>lity to anyone. Candra did not gainsay his father-in-
<>law, but he did not make any change in his disposition.
<>After a few days all the daughters except Rohin2i went
<>to the palace of Daks2a and told him that they were
<>going to stay with him. This time Daks2a got angry and
<>called Candra and cursed him to become a sick man
<>(of consumption).
<NI>From that day onwards Candra became a patient affec-
<>ted with consumption. All the vegetations in the world
<>began to weaken. It appeared that the world was
<>about to be destroyed. So the gods approached Daks2a
<>and requested him to show some leniency towards
<>Candra. Daks2a accordingly called Candra and told
<>him that he would be affected by consumption only for a
<>fortnight and after that he would recover gradually.
<>Candra went to Prabha1sa ti1rtha and Sarasvati1 ti1rtha and
<>dipped in water. He began to recover from that day.
<>It is according to the curse of Daksa that Candra (Moon)
<>waxes and wanes. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 35).

<HI>DAKSASA1VARN2I. The name of the ninth Manu.
<>During the regime of this Manu, there will be three
<>classes of devas (gods) called the Parn2as, the Mari1ci-
<>garbhas and the Sudharmans. Each of these gan2as or
<>classes will consist of twelve devas or gods. Indra, their

<>hermits) and Dhr2taketu, Di1ptiketu, Pan5cahasta, Nira1-
<>maya, Pr2thus4rava and others will be the sons of Manu,
<>Daks2asa1varn2i. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 2).
<HI>DA1KS2A1YAN2I. Daughter of Daks2a. This name is gene-
<>rally used for all the daughters of Daks2a. Occasionally
<>this name is used for the grand daughters of Daks2a
<>also.
<HI>DAKS2IN2A1. A daughter, born to Praja1pati Ruci, by his
<>wife A1ku1ti. The first Manu was Sva1yambhuva, the son
<>of Brahma1. He accepted S4ataru1pa1, his sister who be-
<>came sinless by penance, as his wife. S4ataru1pa1 gave birth
<>to two sons Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da, and two
<>daughters, Prasu1ti and A1ku1ti. Of these two daughters,
<>Prasu1ti1 was given to Praja1pati Daks2a and A1ku1ti to
<>Praja1pati Ruci. A1ku1ti gave birth to twins, a son named
<>Yajn5a and a daughter named Daks2in2a1. To Yajn5a
<>twelve sons were born by Daks2in2a1. They were a class
<>of devas (gods) called the Ya1mas in the regime of Manu
<>Sva1yambhuva (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7).
<>Now Daks2in2a1 is worshipped as a goddess. The same
<>Daks2in2a1 was reborn in the Goloka under the name
<>Sus4i1la1. At that time she was a cowherd woman and
<>friend of Ra1dha1. She liked to talk with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. One
<>day Ra1dha1 saw her sitting in the lap of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>engaged in sexual sports, in a secluded place. When
<>Sus4i1la1 saw that Ra1dha1 had found them out, she be-
<>came dumbfounded with shame, and sat with bowed
<>head. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a slowly placed Sus4i1la1 devi down and
<>instantly vanished. The angry Ra1dha1 cursed Sus4i1la1 to
<>become ashes if ever she entered the Goloka again. Then
<>Ra1dha1 ran about everywhere in search of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>but he could not be found.
<NI>Immediately after the curse, Sus4i1la1 got down from the
<>Goloka and began to worship Maha1laks2mi1 with devotion
<>and meditation and very severe fast and vow. After
<>a long time Maha1laks2mi1 appeared to her and blessed
<>her, and Sus4i1la1 became absorbed in Maha1laks2mi1.
<>Since the absorption of Sus4i1la1 devi1, who was the rebirth
<>of Daks2in2a1devi1, in Maha1laks2mi1, the sacrifice of the
<>devas (gods) became fruitless. They were much grieved.
<>They all went to Brahma1 to find a solution. As the matter
<>was serious Brahma1 meditated upon Vis2n2u, who [Page195-a+ 65]
<>became pleased with Brahma1 and to save the devas, he
<>attracted Daks2in2a1devi1 from the body of Maha1laks2mi1
<>and gave her as a present to Brahma1. Brahma1 gave that
<>devi1 (goddess) to Yajn5apurus2a (the god of sacrifice)
<>so that the sacrifices of gods might become fruitful.
<>When Yajn5apurus2a saw that supernatural beauty he was
<>overpowered by lust and swooned. The couple spent a
<>hundred divine years in seclusion enjoying the company
<>of each other, as a result of which devi1 became pregnant.
<>The pregnancy matured in twelve divine years and she
<>gave birth to a child which was named Phalada. It is
<>this same Phalada, the son of Yajn5apurus2a and Daks2in2a1
<>who awards fruits to all actions. The learned men say
<>that Yajn5apurus2a, Daks2in2a1devi1 and Phalada divide the
<>fruits of actions among the doers. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).

<>under control. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30).
<HI>DAKS2IN2APA1N5CA1LA. A place famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>This place lies to the south of the Ganges up to the river
<>Cam3pat. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 14, Stanza 27, that the King of this country
<>fled to the south fearing Jara1sandha. Pa1n5ca1la lies to the
<>south and north of the Ganges. But the country was
<>divided into two when Dron2a defeated Drupada the
<>King of Pa1n5ca1la, and took away from him the part of the
<>country north of the Ganges. After that, the part taken
<>by Dron2a was called Uttarapa1n5ca1la and the part south
<>of the Ganges was called Daks2in2apa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 137).
<HI>DAKS2IN2ASINDHU. A holy place. This place is on the

<>Va1madeva was the priest of this King. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 192). See Pari1ks2it II.
<HI>DA1LBHYA (BAKADA1LBHYA). A Mahars2i of Naimi-
<>s4a1ran2ya. In Va1mana Pura1n2a, there is a story of how this
<>sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>kingdom in the sacrificial fire.
<NI>Long ago some of the sages of Naimis4a1ran2ya approached
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra with a request for some money. Their
<>leader was the sage Da1lbhya (Baka). It was he who
<>begged Dhr2tara1s2t2ra for money. The king not only
<>refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Pro-
<>voked at this, Da1lbhya began performing a homa in [Page195-b+ 65]
<>which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's kingdom was the havis in the form
<>of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avaki1rn2a-
<>maha1ti1rtha at Pr2thu1daka. As a result of it the kingdom
<>began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted
<>great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the
<>country's decline. They told him that the cause of the
<>disaster was Da1lbhya's homa. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra at once pro-
<>ceeded with rich presents to propitiate Da1lbhya at
<>Avaki1rn2amaha1ti1rtha. Da1lbhya was pleased and as
<>desired by the King, performed homa with milk and
<>honey and revived all those who had died. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 39).
<NI>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says
<>that this Mahar2s2i flourished in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly.
<>On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to
<>Dyumatsena, the father of Satyava1n. At that time, he
<>comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyava1n would be
<>blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>298, Verse 17).
<HI>DA1LBHYAM. A holy place in North India. (M.B.

<HI>DAMA I. The brother of Damayanti1. No other informa-
<>tion about Dama is available in the Pura1n2as.
<HI>DAMA II. A hermit. He was one of the hermits who
<>came to visit Bhi1s2ma when he was lying on the bed of
<>arrows. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 26, Stanza 4).

<>Cedi. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 186, Stanza 86).
<HI>DAMANA I. A brother of Damayanti1. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 8 it is mentioned that
<>King Bhi1ma had a daughter named Damayanti1, and
<>three sons named Dama, Da1nta and Damana.
<HI>DAMANA II. A hermit. Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha
<>pleased this hermit, who blessed the King and said that
<>he would get children. Accordingly the king got Dama-
<>yanti1 as his daughter and Dama, Da1nta and Damana
<>as his sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<HI>DAMANA III. The son of the King Paurava. Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna killed Damana in the battle of Bha1rata. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 61, Stanza 20).
<HI>DAMANA IV. A son of Bharadva1ja. After the investiture
<>with the Brahma string (upanayana) Damana started
<>on a travel. On the way near Amarakan2t2aka he met
<>with the hermit Garga who talked to him about the
<>glory of Ka1s4i. Damana who was a seeker of spiritual

<>who was a dweller of the sea. Vis2n2u threw the body of
<>the asura into the earth. By the touch of the Lord the
<>body became fragrant and it was changed to a plant
<>which is known as (Kozhunnu or Kozhuntu) Dama-
<>nakam. (Skanda Pura1n2a). [Page196-a+ 64]
<HI>DAMANAKAM. The Ta1tiri tree (Grislea Tomentosa).
<>The ceremony of worshipping this tree is called Dama-
<>naka1rohan2avidhi. The Grislea tree is supposed to be
<>Bhairava, who had been changed to a tree by the curse
<>of S4iva. A story to this effect occurs in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Bhairava was formed from the anger of S4iva. Bhairava,
<>against the will of S4iva, destroyed the devas, and so
<>S4iva cursed him and turned him to a Ta1tiri tree. It is
<>called Damanaka because Bhairava tried to do ‘damana’
<>(restraint or punishment) to the gods.
<NI>Bhairava felt sorry at the curse of S4iva. He requested
<>S4iva to withdraw the curse. At last S4iva had pity on him
<>and said that all would worship Damanaka tree. The
<>method of that worship is called Damanaka1rohan2a-
<>vidhi. It is given below:
<NI>This tree should be worshipped on the seventh or thir-
<>teenth lunar day. The worshipper should go to the
<>tree, with those who recite mantras and spells. After
<>the worship is over the worshipper should say, “O,
<>Tree, which has originated by the power of Hari, you
<>come to my presence. On behalf of S4iva, and by his
<>order, I have to take you home.” Saying thus the
<>tree should be taken home and consecrated in the even-
<>ing in accordance with the rituals. In the house, the
<>Sun, S4iva and Agni should be evoked and worshipped
<>and then the root of the tree should be planted in the
<>I1s4a1na (N.E. point) corner of the house and when it
<>is planted, the spell or incantation of Va1madeva Mantra
<>or S4iromantra should be recited. In the same way
<>the trunk with the branches of the tree is planted on
<>the Northern part. The fallen leaves and flowers
<>should be placed on the eastern side. When the root
<>is planted the following prayer should be uttered:
<Poem>A1mantritosi deves4a
<>pra1tah2 ka1le maya1 prabho /
<>Kartavyastapaso la1bha1h2
<>Pu1rn2am3 sarvam3 tava1jn5aya1. //</Poem>
<>After that at dawn he should take bath and with obla-
<>tions of sweet-smelling flowers etc. should worship
<>S4iva. This is Damanaka1rohan2avidhi. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 80).
<HI>DAMAYANTI1 Daughter of Bhi1ma the King of Vidar-
<>bha. The most noble of all the Indian heroines, Dama-
<>yanti1 has secured a place in the literatures of almost
<>all the languages in the world. The famous hero Nala
<>is her huband.
<NI>1) {%The background of the story of Nala.%} During the time
<>of the forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas, Arjuna had gone to
<>Kaila1sa to do penance before S4iva for getting divine
<>weapons. The rest of the Pa1n2d2avas spent the time
<>till the arrival of Arjuna, in sorrow and sadness. They
<>spent miserable days one by one. At that time the her-
<>mit Br2hadas4va visited them. They welcomed the
<>hermit. In the midst of their conversation Dharma-
<>putra told the hermit with tears that he was the most
<>unhappy man in the world. Hearing this the hermit
<>told them the story of Nala, to console the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Damayanti1.%} The King Bhi1ma of Vidar-
<>bha was childless for a long time. While the King was
<>spending sorrowful days, as he had no children, a
<>hermit named Dama reached his palace. The King
<>welcomed the hermit. Seeing the sorrow of the King the
<>hermit blessed the King and the queen, and as a result
<>a daughter named Damayanti1 and as her brothers [Page196-b+ 64]
<>three sons Dama, Da1nta and Damana were born to
<>them.
<NI>3) {%The Svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1.%} During
<>this period a son named Nala was born to Vi1rasena the
<>King of Nis2adha. The child was an expert in the game
<>of dice and he would speak only truth. He grew up
<>and became a youth.
<NI>Once the swans which came to the palace of Dama-
<>yanti1 from Nala, began to praise Nala. They sang
<>about the glory of Nala. Nala also knew about the
<>beauty and the other good qualities of Damayanti1.
<>Thus they fell in love with each other. Nala also started
<>for Kun2d2inapuri1, the capital city of Vidarbha, to marry
<>Damayanti1. The devas (gods) Indra, Agni, Varun2a
<>and Yama, having heard of the beauty of Damayanti1
<>from Na1rada, had gone Kun2d2inapuri1, to take part
<>in the marriage. On the way they met Nala. They
<>were aware of the fact that Damayanti1 was in love
<>with Nala. So they called Nala and sent him to Dama-
<>yanti1 with a message that Damayanti1 should accept
<>one of the four gods as her husband. By the boon of
<>invisibility, given by the Gods, Nala entered the room
<>of Damayanti1 unseen by others and gave the message
<>to Damayanti1. But Damayanti1 did not agree to it.
<>The Gods also entered the nuptial hall and took their
<>seats in the shape of four Nalas. Damayanti1 entered
<>the hall with the nuptial garland in her hands. She
<>saw five Nalas including the real Nala, and prayed to
<>the gods to show her the real Nala her lover. So the
<>devas assumed their real forms and Damayanti1 put
<>the garland on the neck of the real Nala and accepted
<>him as her husband. Being much pleased with the be-
<>haviour and character of both Nala and Damayanti1,
<>the four gods blessed them. Agni promised to be near
<>Nala whenever he thought of him. Yama said that
<>Nala would always be righteous. Varun2a said that
<>Nala would obtain water at the thought of it. Indra
<>blessed him saying that he would get moks2a immedia-
<>tely after the completion of a ya1ga. The gods remained
<>till the end of the marriage ceremony and then they
<>departed. Nala and Damayanti1 lived in Kun2d2inapuri1.
<NI>4) {%The hatred between Kali and Dva1para.%} Hearing about
<>the Svayamvara of Damayanti1 Kali and Dva1para
<>started for Kun2d2inapuri1. On the way they met Indra
<>and the other gods, who were returning from the marri-
<>age of Damayanti1. They told Kali and Dva1para that
<>Damayanti1 had accepted Nala as her husband. Kali
<>and Dva1para got angry at this and returned saying
<>that they would destroy the kingdom of Nala. After
<>that Kali waited for a chance to enter the body of
<>Nala. After twelve years, once Nala, after passing
<>urine, without washing his legs performed his evening
<>worship. At that moment Kali entered the body of
<>Nala. With that Nala became bereft of all senses of
<>righteousness and duty, and challenged his younger
<>brother Pus2kara to a game of dice. Pus2kara engaged
<>Nala in the game of dice. Kali stood in the shape of
<>an ox as helper of Nala. Nala lost his kingdom in the
<>game. Seeing that her husband was being defeated
<>continuously, Damayanti1 sent for the charioteer Va1rs2-
<>n2eya and sent her son Indrasena and daughter Indra-
<>sena1 to Kun2d2inapuri1. After leaving the children at Kun2d2i-
<>napuri1 Va1rs2n2eya engaged himself in a travel. After
<>visiting several countries he reached Ayodhya1 and [Page197-a+ 65]
<>became the charioteer of King R2tuparn2a.
<NI>5) {%Nala and Damayanti1 to the forest.%} Pus2kara got the
<>kingdom, wealth and everything that his elder brother,
<>Nala, had possessed. The miserable Nala left every-
<>thing he had and clad in only one cloth got out of the
<>palace. His wife Damayanti1 followed him. They stayed
<>outside the city for three days. Pus2kara made a pro-
<>clamation that if anybody rendered any help to Nala
<>he would be ruthlessly put to death. After that Nala stay-
<>ed there for three more days, with only water for food
<>and drink. Then he went to the forest. His wife followed
<>him. They were hungry. Nala saw some golden birds.
<>Nala wanted to catch them for food. So he took his
<>only cloth and spread it on the ground. The birds
<>took that cloth and flew away. Those birds were the
<>dices used in the game. They were influenced by
<>Kali. The miserable and hungerstricken Nala asked
<>his wife Damayanti1 to go with the caravan traders
<>who were going to Avanti and save herself. But she
<>did not consent to go away from him.
<NI>They spent that night in an inn. They both fell asleep
<>because of weakness. After a time Nala woke up.
<>He thought that his wife would somehow or other
<>get to some country closeby and save herself, if he
<>left her there. So he decided to take half of her cloth.
<>How to do it without her knowledge? Thinking so he
<>walked round the inn. He saw a good sword. He
<>took the sword, and cut half of the cloth of Damayanti1
<>and leaving her in the inn he went away.
<NI>In a short while she woke up and missing her husband
<>she cried aloud and ran here and there in search of
<>him. Then she went into the forest crying. A big snake
<>caught hold of her and began to swallow her. She cried
<>aloud. Hearing the cry, a forester came there. He
<>cut the snake open and saved Damayanti1. But when
<>he saw her he became overpowered by libido and
<>tried to make her his wife. She got angry and cursed
<>him and he instantly fell down dead. After this she
<>began to wander in the forest aimlessly, often seeing
<>wild animals and fearing them. At last she got on a
<>rock and sat there and began to wail thinking of Nala.
<NI>6) {%Damayanti1 in the kingdom of Cedi.%} While she was
<>sitting on the rock wailing, a caravan of traders came
<>by that way. They had been attacked by a herd of
<>elephants and were running away from them. They
<>saw Damayanti1. She told them her story. They brought
<>her to the kingdom of Cedi. She wandered through
<>the country for a while and finally reached the palace
<>of the King Suba1hu. Thinking her to be a mad wo-
<>man the street boys were following her. The queen
<>saw the woman surrounded by street boys and felt
<>pity for her. She sent her maid and brought her to
<>the palace. Without revealing that she was the queen
<>of King Nala, she told everything else to the queen.
<>The queen consoled her and said that she would get her
<>husband back. She invited Damayanti1 to stay in the
<>palace till she got her husband back. Damayanti1
<>replied as follows: “Mother, I shall stay here. But
<>there are certain conditions. I won't eat remains and
<>offals of victuals, I won't make others to wash my legs.
<>I won't talk with men who are not related to me. If
<>anybody hankers after me you must order him to be
<>killed. Bra1hman2as may come and see me only in con-
<>nection with the search for my husband. This is my
<>vow.” The queen agreed to her conditions and made [Page197-b+ 65]
<>her the attendant of her daughter Sunanda1.
<NI>7) {%Nala in Ayodhya1.%} Nala filled with sorrow was walk-
<>ing along the forest when he saw a wild fire. From the
<>midst of the fire somebody was calling Nala by name
<>and crying. When Nala approached the fire, he saw
<>the great and famous serpent Karkot2aka lying entwined
<>in the flames. Karkot2aka the King of the Na1gas had
<>once deceived Na1rada, who then cursed him that he
<>would become stationary in a place like an immovable
<>thing till Nala came and rescued him. From that day
<>onwards, Karkot2aka was remaining in that forest with-
<>out moving. Then the forest caught fire. Karkot2aka
<>being unable to move had to remain in the fire. Nala
<>immediately saved Karkot2aka from the fire and with
<>that he was absolved from the curse of Na1rada. Kar-
<>kot2aka asked Nala to walk forward, counting the steps.
<>When Nala counted ten, Karkot2aka bit on the leg of
<>Nala and he became ugly. Then the serpent said to
<>the flurried Nala, “Don't fear. I have made you ugly
<>so that others may not recognize you. Now you are
<>ugly because of my poison. But my poison has affected
<>Kali who is in your body. Because he had harmed
<>you who are blameless, he has to suffer for it. So long
<>as this poison is in you, nobody will harm you. You
<>must go to R2tuparn2a the King of Ayodhya1 and tell
<>him that you are Ba1huka a charioteer. You must give
<>R2tuparn2a the spell ‘As4vahr2daya mantra’ and get
<>from him the spell ‘Aks2ahr2dayamantra’. After that
<>you will have reunion with your wife and children.
<>Here are two cloths for you. Whenever you want
<>to get your original form you need only wear them.”
<>Saying these words Karkot2aka gave Nala two divine
<>garments and then disappeared.
<NI>Nala started for Ayodhya1. He reached the palace
<>on the tenth day. There he was employed as the horse
<>keeper of R2tuparn2a on a pay of hundred pieces of gold.
<>Thus he stayed there under the name Ba1huka. Va1rs2n2eya
<>and Ji1vala who were the horse-keepers of R2tuparn2a
<>upto that time, were placed under Ba1huka.
<NI>Ba1huka used to recite a poem every evening when he
<>returned from his work.
<Poem>Weary and worn of hunger and thirst,
<>That poor woman, where might she be?
<>Serving whom will she be now.
<>Thinking of the unlucky fool?</Poem>
<NI>Hearing this song of lamentation everyday, once his
<>assistant Ji1vala asked Ba1huka, whom he was reciting
<>the poem about. Ba1huka replied: “Once there was
<>a man who was a fool. He got a good wife. For some
<>reason they were separated. The fool is still wandering
<>about weary and sad in search of his wife.”
<NI>8) {%Damayanti1 in Kun2d2inapura.%} At this time Dama-
<>yanti1 was living in the palace of the King of Cedi,
<>as the maid of princess Sunanda1. King Bhi1ma became
<>very sorry not knowing where Nala and Damayanti1
<>had gone. He sent men in all directions to search for
<>them. The King proclaimed that those who found
<>them would be awarded thousand cows, lands assigned
<>to Brahmins, and villages. He proclaimed that so
<>many cows would be given even to those who could
<>give any information about them. Hearing this Bra1h-
<>man2as went in all directions and Sudeva, one of them,
<>reached the Kingdom of Cedi. He recognized Dama-
<>yanti1 who was like fire inside the cover of smoke. When
<>Damayanti1 was alone Sudeva approached her and [Page198-a+ 65]
<>said that he had come from Vidarbha and that he was
<>a friend of Damayanti1's brother. Damayanti1 recog-
<>nized Sudeva and she cried aloud. Sunanda1 who saw
<>this scene, told her mother about it. The queen sent
<>for Sudeva and asked him what the matter was. He
<>revealed everything about Damayanti1, to the queen.
<>When they heard the story all the women in the harem
<>cried. Then with tears the queen said, “Hear this,
<>Damayanti1, your mother and myself are the two daugh-
<>ters of Sudama the King of Das4a1rn2a. Father gave
<>your mother to Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha and me
<>to Vi1raba1hu the King of Cedi. I have seen you when
<>you were an infant.”
<NI>When the King of Cedi knew everything he sent Dama-
<>yanti1 in a palanquin to Vidarbha.
<NI>9) {%The search for Nala.%} Damayanti1 told her father
<>that she didn't want to live any longer unless Nala
<>was brought to her. Bhi1ma had been trying hard to
<>find out Nala. One day Parn2a1da one of the numerous
<>Brahmins who were engaged in the search for Nala,
<>came to Bhi1ma and said, “while I was wandering from
<>place to place, I happened to reach the palace of R2tu-
<>parn2a the King of Ayodhya1. There I made enquiries
<>about Nala the husband of Damayanti1, in the pre-
<>sence of the King. But nobody gave me any answer.
<>When I returned Ba1huka the charioteer of R2tuparn2a
<>followed me. An ugly man with short hands, an ex-
<>pert in driving horses, and an excellent cook, he asked
<>me several questions about Damayanti1.”
<NI>When Damayanti1 heard this she had horripilation.
<>She secretly went to her mother and compelled her
<>to send Sudeva the Bra1hman2a to Ayodhya1. Her mother
<>consented. She called Sudeva, in the presence of her
<>mother and told him to go to Ayodhya1 and tell R2tuparn2a
<>that the second svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1
<>would take place before sunrise next day and that
<>he should come earlier. Sudeva instantly went to
<>Ayodhya1.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, hearing the words of Sudeva, wanted
<>Ba1huka to take him in the chariot to Vidarbha within
<>the period of a day time for the second svayam3vara
<>of Damayanti1. Nala consented with a breaking heart.
<>Immediately they started. Va1rs2n2eya also got into
<>the chariot. The chariot flew through the sky with
<>tremendous speed, to Vidarbha. On the way the upper
<>garment of the King fell on the ground. He ordered
<>the chariot to be stopped for taking his upper garment.
<>Nala said that within that winking time the chariot
<>had travelled a yojana (league) and gloried in his
<>power of driving horses. Then they saw in the forest
<>a Tanni tree (Terminalia bellerica) with fruits. Seeing
<>the Tanni tree the King said, “O Ba1huka, if you are
<>an expert in horse-driving I am an expert in reckoning.
<>I will tell you how many leaves and nuts there are
<>in that Tanni Tree. There are five crores of leaves in
<>both the branches together and two thousand and
<>ninetyfive nuts. They stopped the chariot and checked
<>the tree and found the reckoning of the King correct.
<>The King had the knowledge of the art called ‘Aks2ahr2-
<>daya’. It was with this art that the king calculated
<>the number of leaves in the tree, at one look. Ba1huka
<>drove the chariot with the speed of wind because he had
<>known the art called ‘As4vahr2daya’. Then and there,
<>Ba1huka taught the King the art of ‘As4vahr2daya’ and
<>the King taught Ba1huka the art of ‘Aks2ahr2daya’. The [Page198-b+ 65]
<>moment Nala learned Aks2ahr2daya Kali vomitted
<>the poison of Karkot2aka and got out of the body of
<>Nala. Long ago, the mother of Indrasena, a god, had
<>cursed Kali and drove him out. Since then Kali had
<>been living in the body of Nala. As soon as he came
<>out Kali begged Nala for pardon. Nala curbed his
<>anger. But Kali was afraid of Nala. So he made the
<>Tanni tree his abode. Because of that Tanni became
<>detestable.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, Va1rs2n2eya and Ba1huka reached Kun2d2ina-
<>pura in the evening. When the sound of the chariot
<>of Nala reached the ears of Damayanti1 her heart bumped
<>with joy. The chariot was stopped and R2tuparn2a
<>entered the palace. The King Bhi1ma welcomed
<>R2tuparn2a heartily. As there was no sign of any prepara-
<>tion for the svayam3vara (marriage) R2tuparn2a under-
<>stood that some sort of trick had been played on him.
<NI>10) {%Test of Nala.%} Damayanti1 sent her maid Kes4ini1
<>to Ba1huka to watch him. Kes4ini1 had a secret talk
<>with Ba1huka. Though Nala did not reveal himself,
<>he cried when she talked about Damayanti1. Kes4ini1
<>returned to Damayanti1 and told her what she had
<>heard and seen. Damayanti1 became more and more
<>convinced that Ba1huka was Nala himself So she sent
<>Kes4ini1 again to Nala. She discovered the following
<>facts about Ba1huka, after a keen observation, and
<>made a report of them.
<NI>(1) Ba1huka does not stop to pass through even a small
<>door. The upper sill lifts by itself for him to pass
<>through.
<NI>(2) He gets enough room for him to pass through even
<>a big crowd.
<NI>(3) Empty pots are filled with water at a look from him.
<NI>(4) When he stretches out a grass to the sun, it catches
<>fire.
<NI>(5) Fire does not burn him even if he touches it.
<NI>(6) When he crushes a flower, it blooms more beauti-
<>ful and fragrant than before.
<NI>When Kes4ini1 said all these facts to Damayanti1, she
<>became fully convinced that Ba1huka was none other
<>than Nala himself. Damayanti1 sent Kes4ini1 again to
<>Ba1huka to get some meat cooked by him. Damayanti1
<>tested the taste of the meat brought by Kes4ini1 and
<>she knew that the food was cooked by Nala. She
<>sent Kes4ini1 again to Ba1huka with her children. See-
<>ing Indrasena and Indrasena1 coming to him, Ba1huka
<>ran to them, gathered them and embraced them and
<>cried aloud. Then he told Kes4ini1 that he had done
<>so because the children were just like his two child-
<>ren.
<NI>11) {%Reunion.%} After having tested Ba1huka so far Dama-
<>yanti1 sent Kes4ini1 to her mother to tell her everything,
<>and to say that she was convinced of the fact that
<>Ba1huka was none other than Nala and that the diffe-
<>rence was only in shape and to request that she may
<>be permitted to see Ba1huka in person. The queen
<>informed the King of all these facts. With the permis-
<>sion of her parents Ba1huka was brought to the room
<>of Damayanti1. The moment Ba1huka saw Damayanti1
<>he began to shed tears. Damayanti1 also was filled
<>with emotion. But she told him thus:--
<NI>“Ba1huka, have you seen a man who had left his sleep-
<>ing wife in the forest? Who else, but Nala the famous
<>and the righteous would discard his blameless and
<>loving wife who had been sleeping, with fatigue and [Page199-a+ 65]
<>hunger in a lonely place? Have I done anything
<>wrong to him in my younger days so that he should
<>leave me in the forest when I was sleeping? Leaving
<>aside real gods I married him. I worshipped, him. I had
<>children from his blood and now he has abandoned
<>me. In the presence of Gods and with fire as witness,
<>holding my hands he had taken a vow that he would
<>support and protect me. Where has that vow gone?”
<>At these words Ba1huka shed tears for a long time.
<>Then he told her all that had happened to him since
<>their separation. Damayanti1 requested Nala, not to
<>have any misconception regarding the idea of a second
<>svayam3vara; she said to him that she committed no
<>wrong and that her fidelity and loyalty had undergone
<>no change. At that time Va1yu (the wind-god) in an
<>etherial voice said “Damayanti1 has committed no
<>sin”. Immediately Nala put on the divine clothes
<>given by Karkot2aka and regained his original form.
<>Damayanti1 embraced Nala and cried aloud. The king
<>her father, mother and the people of the city all ran
<>to them.
<NI>Next day R2tuparn2a returned. After a few days Nala
<>collected an army consisting of three hundred soldiers,
<>sixteen elephants, fifty horses and a white chariot only,
<>from Vidarbha and went to the kingdom of Nis2adha.
<>Reaching there Nala challenged Pus2kara for a game of
<>dice. Pus2kara refused the challenge. Nala took his
<>sword to cut Pus2kara into two. Finally Pus2kara agreed
<>to play. At the first cast of the dice the life and the
<>Kingdom of Pus2kara fell into the hands of Nala. But
<>Nala did not kill Pus2kara; instead, he embraced him.
<>Nala became King. Damayanti1 and the children reached
<>Nis2adha. Nala ruled the country with more happiness
<>and prosperity than before. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapters 52 to 79).

<>advised him to challenge Nara Na1ra1yan2as who were
<>doing penance on the northern-most point of the earth.
<>So the emperor went with his mighty army to Gandha-
<>ma1dana and informed Nara and Na1ra1yan2a of his desire
<>to fight. They said that they were mere hermits and
<>that they had no power to fight. But Dam3bhodbhava was
<>not satisfied. Finally Nara and Na1ra1yan2a took some
<>is2i1ka1 grass and began to fight the emperor with it.
<>Though the army of the emperor was mighty and vast
<>it could not stand against the grass in the hands of the [Page199-b+ 65]
<>hermits. Finally the emperor admitted failure and
<>bowed before the hermits. They advised him not to be
<>arrogant in future and to lead a pure life. Hearing the

<>devoted man. He returned to his palace and led a life
<>of righteousness. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 96).

<>Dan2d2a once went to a Vais2n2avite temple to commit
<>robbery. When he reached the steps of the temple he
<>wiped his legs which were wet, on the ground and a
<>small depression that was there, was levelled by the [Page200-b+ 65]
<>drawing of his legs. He broke the lock with an iron rod
<>and entered the temple. Inside the temple he saw Kr2s2n2a,
<>clad in yellow robes lying on a beautiful cot, with his
<>spouse Ra1dha1. The thief instantly bowed before the
<>spouse of Ra1dha1. By this act his sins were washed away.
<>Still impelled by his evil nature, he took the silk garment
<>of Kr2s2n2a, spread it on the ground, collected as many
<>things as he could take, placed them in the garment and
<>making them into a bundle, got out of the temple
<>with shaky feet. The bundle fell on the ground with a

<>vite temple, at the steps of the temple, he levelled a pit
<>by the mud on his leg, and that single good deed on
<>his part has wiped out all his sins.” Hearing this Yama
<>gave him a golden seat and showed hospitality and then
<>bowed before him and said “By the soil on your legs you
<>have purified my abode today. I am grateful to you.

<>and fifty pan2as (a coin) was called Prathama S4a1hasa
<>dan2d2a (first degree of punishment) and fining up to
<>five hundred pan2as was called Madhyama Sa1hasa [Page201-b+ 65]
<>dan2d2a (medium punishment) and fining upto thou-
<>sand pan2as was called Uttama Sa1hasa dan2d2a (highest
<>degree of punishment). If a man complains to
<>the King that his property is stolen, when actually
<>it is not stolen, the man will be fined the amount
<>that is said to have been stolen. There was another
<>law, that the owner of the stolen property and
<>the thief would have to pay double the amount
<>they admit, if the amount shown in the complaint
<>differed from the actual amount stolen. For appear-
<>ing as false witness, the three classes of non-Brahmins
<>were punished with fine and if he was a Brahmin he
<>would have to be cast out of the society. The King
<>ordered that if one spent the property entrusted with
<>him for keeping, the owner of the property would
<>have to be paid double the amount. If one says that
<>he has given the property for keeping when actually
<>it is not, the person will have to be punished as if he
<>were a thief. If a man spends an amount without
<>knowing that it was the property of others, the man
<>will have to be acquitted of the charge.
<NI>If an artisan has received money in advance for a parti-
<>cular product and fails to give the thing at the stipu-
<>lated time the King will fine the artisan one svarn2a.
<>If a man received money in advance on a promise to
<>do a particular work and if he fails to do the work he
<>will be fined one Kr2s2n2ala of gold. (One Kr2s2n2ala
<>weighs three yavagrains). If a man conceals his diseases
<>and marries a damsel, she will be considered as a spins-
<>ter and the man will be fined two hundred pan2as.
<>If a cowherd agrees to look after the cows of another
<>receiving pay and food and refuses to return the cow
<>to the owner the King will fine him hundred pan2as.
<>If a Ks2atriya scoffed a Bra1hman2a the fine imposed
<>would be hundred pan2as. If it is a Vais4ya the fine will
<>be two hundred pan2as. If it is a S4u1dra he will be put
<>to death. If a Brahmin scoffs a Ks2atriya the fine is
<>fifty pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Vais4ya the fine is twenty-
<>five pan2as. If a Brahmin scoffs a S4u1dra the fine is
<>only twelve pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Ks2atriya his
<>tongue should be cut off. If a S4u1dra advises a Brahmin,
<>he may inflict any punishment on the S4u1dra.
<NI>If a S4u1dra wronged a Brahmin, the S4u1dra might be
<>punished by cutting off the organ which was employed
<>in the crime. If one spat at a Brahmin, the two lips of
<>the culprit might be cut off. If a man passed urine on a
<>Brahmin the culprit would have his penis cut off. If
<>a S4u1dra sits on the seats of the upper classes his but-
<>tock will have to be cut off. If one slays cow, elephant,
<>camel or horse half of his limbs will have to be cut
<>off. Cutting across a road, changing of boundaries,
<>making the water of pools and ponds impure etc. will
<>have to be punished with a fine of two suvarn2as. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 227).
<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I I. A king of the family of Yaya1ti.
<>This King was the son of Vibhi1nara and the father
<>of Nimi. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I II. The son of Paun2d2raka, the King
<>of Ka1s4i. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Paun2d2raka. As his son
<>Dan2d2apa1n2i was not powerful enough to kill S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>he performed the sacrifice of Mahes4vara yajn5a. Being
<>pleased at the sacrifice S4iva created Kr2tya1 in the
<>sacrificial fire and sent her to Dva1raka1 to destroy S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a, who aimed his Sudars4ana cakra (wheel-weapon)
<>at her. She ran to Va1ra1n2asi1, where the wheel turned [Page202-a+ 65]
<>Kr2tya1 and everybody with her to ashes. (Padma-

<HI>DAN2D2I1 III. A famous critic and writer of Sanskrit
<>literature. He lived in the 6th century B.C. His criti-

<>marrow of the bo{??}es, and liver and sperm in the fire.
<>When the sperm was put in the fire there was a voice
<>‘Don't’ and with that the king fell dead. And instantly
<>seven luminous children came out from the fire. They
<>began to cry aloud. Hearing their cry Brahma1 came
<>there and anointed them as the Maruts (wind gods).
<>They were the maruts of Ta1masamanvantara. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 72).
<HI>DANTAVAKTRA I. A Ks2atriya king of Ka1ru1s2a. He was

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Das4aratha was the son of Aja, of the family
<>of Iks2va1ku, born of his wife Indumati1.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, Stanza 6 that ‘Ilabila1, was the name of the mother of Das4aratha.</F>
<NI>3) {%Das4aratha's hunt.%} Once during the early part of his
<>life Das4aratha was walking through a forest engaged in
<>hunting. He reached the bank of the river Sarayu1.
<>It was evening and the forest was thick. He walked in
<>search of wild animals. The night was advancing and
<>darkness getting thicker. Then he heard a sound from
<>the river as if an elephant was drinking water. Thinking
<>it to be an elephant Das4aratha sent an arrow in the
<>direction from which the sound came. Instantly he heard
<>a man crying with pain. The king was disappointed.
<>He ran to the spot and saw a hermit boy lying in a pool
<>of blood beating his limbs on the ground and crying.
<>The waterpot he had been dipping in the water lay
<>close by. In answer to the questions of the King, the [Page204-a+ 65]
<>hermit boy whose name was S4ravan2a,
<F>1. In Agnipura1n2a Chapter 6, it is stated that the name of this hermit boy was Yajn5adatta.</F> said, “Oh
<>King! What wrong have I done? My parents are
<>sitting thirsty and blind with age, in the hermitage close-
<>by. I, their only son, was dipping the pot to take water
<>to them, when you sent the arrow at me. So, please take
<>some water to them in this pot and console them.”
<NI>Hearing this, with tears the King drew out the fatal
<>arrow from the body of the boy and with that the boy
<>S4ravan2a said good bye to the world. Das4aratha took
<>water in the pot and went in search of the hermitage in
<>the darkness. With difficulty he found out the hermitage
<>and as he drew near, the aged parents of the boy heard
<>his footsteps and called him eagerly. The King, with
<>tearful eyes told them what had happened. There was
<>loud wailing and crying in the hermitage. According to
<>their wish the King took them to where their son lay.
<>Then the King made a fire and placed the dead body
<>of the boy in it. The aged and blind parents cursed
<>Das4aratha, “You also will die of loss of children”.
<>Then they also entered the fire and were burnt along
<>with their son's dead body. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayo-
<>dhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 63).
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} Das4aratha had three wives, named
<>Kaus4alya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1.
<NI>5) {%Kaikeyi1 given a boon.%} There was a great battle in the
<>world of the gods between the asuras and the gods.
<>According to the request of the devas, Das4aratha went to
<>the world of the devas to help them. Kaikeyi1 also went
<>with Das4aratha. In a severe fight with S4ambara, an
<>asura, Das4aratha fell down unconscious. Kaikeyi1 took
<>him away from the battle-field. When he recovered the
<>King got into the chariot and fought more fiercely than
<>before. This time the wheel-bolt of one of the wheels of
<>the chariot of Das4aratha slipped away. Without inform-
<>ing her husband of this danger, Kaikeyi1 inserted her
<>finger into the bolt-hole and prevented the wheel from
<>sliding away. The King won the battle. After the battle,
<>when the King came to know of the services rendered
<>by Kaikeyi1, he promised her two boons. Kaikeyi1 told
<>the King that she would ask for them later, when she
<>needed them. Then they returned to Ayodhya1. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Sarga 9, Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Administration of Das4aratha.%} The capital of Das4a-
<>ratha's kingdom of Kosala, was Ayodhya1. This city was
<>situated on the bank of river Sarayu1. Das4aratha was as
<>famous in Ayodhya1 as Indra was in the realm of the
<>gods. There were palaces in Ayodhya1 for the kings who
<>brought tribute to stay. In short, as mentioned in
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 5, Ayodhya1 was
<>the heaven on earth.
<NI>7) {%Ministers.%} Das4aratha had eight ministers, Sr2s2t2i,
<>Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddha1rtha, Ra1s2t2ravardhana, As4oka,
<>Dharmapa1la, and Sumantra. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<NI>8) {%The name Das4aratha.%} The real name of Das4aratha
<>was Nemi. Once the unattackable and invincible asura
<>S4am3bara conquered the throne of Indra. At the request
<>of Brahma1 and the gods, this King reached heaven and
<>destroyed the armies of the asuras very easily. S4am3bara
<>got angry, assumed ten shapes and attacked the King
<>from ten points at the same time. The king confronted
<>the ten S4am3baras at ten points, at the same time, and
<>killed all of them at the same moment. Because he
<>faced his chariot to ten points at the same time and
<>fought with enemies on those ten points Brahma1 appre- [Page204-b+ 64]
<>ciated his valiant fighting and charioteeering and gave
<>him the name ‘Das4aratha’ (one who is capable of driving
<>the chariot to ten points at the same time). Thus his
<>original name was forgotten and he came to be known
<>only by the name given him later. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>9) {%Birth of Sons.%} Kausalya1 was the first wife of Das4a-
<>ratha. She was the daughter of the King of Uttara
<>Kosala. A daughter named S4a1nta1 was born to Das4aratha
<>by Kausalya1. After this, no sons or daughters were born
<>to Das4aratha for a long time.
<NI>At this juncture Lomapa1da, the king of An3ga who was the
<>class-mate and a great friend of Das4aratha, came to
<>Ayodhya1 on a friendly visit. He also had no children.
<>So he entreated Das4aratha to give S4a1nta1 to him as a
<>foster-daughter. Thus he took away S4a1nta1 to An3ga.
<>Lomapa1da gave S4a1nta1 in marriage to R2s2yas2r2n3ga a
<>hermit. (See under R2s2yas4r2n3ga).
<NI>As Kausalya1 was childless Das4aratha brought as his
<>wife Kaikeyi1 the daughter of the King of Kekaya and
<>sister of Yudha1jit. Still no children were born to them.
<>He was much disappointed. At last he married again and
<>brought Sumitra1 the princess of Ka1s4i. Of these three,
<>Kausalya1 was the chief wife.
<NI>Though he had three wives, Das4aratha still remained
<>childless. The King and his queens spent their days in
<>sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse
<>he had incurred when he was young. The curse was
<>that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their
<>son S4ravan2a, the same thing would happen to me.
<>So he believed that sons would be born to him.
<NI>He performed several devotional acts to get children.
<>Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to
<>lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use
<>and consecrated the idol of Maha1vis2n2u in it. Then entrust-
<>ing the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers
<>he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion
<>and meditation in the temple. Then the King decided
<>to perform the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i (sacrifice for
<>getting children) by the hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga under the
<>guidance of Vasis2t2ha. The King informed R2s2yas4r2n3ga
<>of his decision. R2s2yas4r2n3ga could not refuse the King's
<>request as the king was his father-in-law. Moreover
<>Lomapa1da and S4a1nta1 also requested the hermit to com-
<>ply with the desire of Das4aratha. So R2s2yas4r2n3ga came to
<>Ayodhya1 and the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i was begun.
<>The air vibrated with the recitation of mantras (spells and
<>incantations) and the Veda Su1ktas. The hermit uttered
<>the divine spell of Putraka1mes2t2i and offered oblations
<>in the sacrificial fire. Then a wonderful and luminous
<>figure came out of the fire with a pot containing a
<>pudding of ambrosia, and placed the pot before R2s2ya-
<>s2r2n3ga and then disappeared in the sacrificial fire. When
<>the wonderful figure disappeared, R2s2yas4r2n3ga took the
<>pot of pudding and gave it to Das4aratha with prayer and
<>incantations. Das4aratha received the golden pot and in
<>accordance with the instruction of the hermit, divided
<>the pudding between his first wife Kaus4alya1 and second
<>wife Kaikeyi1, both of whom gave half of their share to
<>Sumitra1. Thus the three wives ate the divine pudding
<>and by and by all of them became pregnant. Kaus4alya1
<>and Kaikeyi1 gave birth to a son each and Sumitra1
<>gave birth to two sons. The son of Kaus4alya1 was called
<>Ra1ma, the son of Kaikeyi1 was named Bharata and the [Page205-a+ 65]
<>sons of Sumitra1 were called Laks2man2a and S4atrughna.

<NI>10) {%The boon of S4ani (Saturn).%} Astronomers are of
<>opinion that famine will occur in the world for the
<>period of twelve years, when the planet S4ani (Saturn)
<>comes into the orbit of Rohin2i1 (a star). But now the
<>planet Saturn does not come into the orbit of the star
<>Rohin2i1. There is a story in the Padma Pura1n2a, which
<>states that this happened so because of a boon S4ani had
<>given to Das4aratha.
<NI>During the regime of Das4aratha the planet S4ani approa-
<>ched the orbit of Rohin2i1. Experts in astronomy said that
<>the earth would be ruined by famine etc. if S4ani cleft
<>the star Rohin2i1. Hearing this Das4aratha took his bow
<>and arrows, got into his chariot, and started for the
<>firmament. He travelled for one lac and a quarter of
<>yojanas (leagues) and reached the hind part of Rohin2i1,
<>which is beyond the sun. Adorned with golden gar-
<>ments and a golden crown studded with jewels, seated
<>on a golden chariot decorated with precious stones, and a
<>lofty flagpost and yoked with horses of the colour of
<>swan, the king shone in the sky as a second sun. He drew
<>the bow-string right upto his ear and placed in it the
<>arrow of destruction. When the devas and the asuras
<>saw the arrow of destruction they began to tremble with
<>fear. S4ani came to Das4aratha and fell before him and
<>said that he would grant any boon to the King, and
<>requested him to recall the arrow of destruction. Das4a-
<>ratha told S4ani that he only wanted S4ani not to come to
<>the orbit of Rohin2i1. S4ani agreed. From that day onwards
<>S4ani has never entered the orbit of Rohin2i1. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Ka1nd2a, Chapter 34).
<NI>11) {%Death.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a with Si1ta1 went to
<>live in the forest. Sumantra who accompanied them
<>up to the river Ganges, returned to the palace. By
<>then Das4aratha had fallen down filled with grief. He
<>had never recovered from that state of unconsciousness.
<>At the time of his death Bharata and S4atrughna had
<>been away in the kingdom of Kekaya and Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the forest. Thus the curse he incurred
<>in his younger days from the aged hermit, the father of
<>S4ravan2a, was fully realized.
<NI>12) {%Das4aratha appears again.%} Ra1van2a was killed in the
<>battle. Si1ta1 was tested in fire and found sinless. Ra1ma
<>accepted her, seeing that her conjugal fidelity was not
<>marred. At this time S4iva appeared before Ra1ma in a
<>divine aeroplane. Das4aratha was seated in that plane
<>clad in pure garments. He took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>into his lap and embraced them. He blessed them and
<>Si1ta1 who was standing with folded hands. Then Das4a-
<>ratha disappeared. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,

<HI>DASYU. The ancient dwellers of North India. What
<>we see in R2gveda is mostly a history of the A1ryans from
<>the period of their exodus from the plateau Kumbha
<>till they reached the banks of the Yamuna1. The plateau
<>of Kum3bha is Kabul. The Dasyus were the first people
<>the Aryans had to confront with after passing the Indus.
<>R2gveda bears testimony to the fact that the civilization
<>of the Dasyus was far advanced than that of the A1ryans.
<>S4am3bara, King of the Dasyus, was the ruler of hundred
<>cities. All the cities were fortified with strong walls and
<>fortresses, which are described as ‘as4vamayi1’, ‘a1yasi1’,
<>‘s4atabhuji1’ etc. The greatest enemies of the A1ryans were
<>the ‘Pan2is’ of these cities. They were a particular class
<>of people of these cities. In the ‘Nirukta of Ya1ska’ it is
<>mentioned that pan2is were traders. Names of many of the
<>Kings of the Dasyus occur in the R2gveda. Dhuni,
<>Cumuri, Pipru, Varcas, S4am3bara and such others are the
<>most valiant and mighty among them. The most impor-
<>tant of the several tribes of the Dasyus were the S4imyus,
<>the Ki1kat2as, S4igrus and the Yaks2us. They are mentioned
<>as the Ana1sas in the R2gveda. (Ana1sas--without nose).
<>Perhaps their nose was flat; more over they are stated as
<>having dark complexion. So it may be assumed that the
<>Dasyus were Dravidians. They talked a primitive
<>language, and they despised sacrificial religion. They did
<>not worship Gods like Indra and others. They possibly
<>worshipped the Phallus, S4iva, Devi and the like.
<HI>DA1TAKACCHA. An ancient country on the bank of
<>the river, Narmada1. (Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>DATTA (DATTAKA). See under Datta1treya.

<HI>DATTA1TMAN. A Vis4vadeva. (A class of gods concerned
<>with sacrifice to the manes). (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,

<HI>DATTA1TREYA. (DATTA). A hermit famous in the
<>pura1n2as.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Anasu1ya1, the wife of hermit Atri gave birth
<>to Datta1treya. But Datta1treya was the incarnation of
<>Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>There is a story in Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a how Maha1-
<>vis2n2u came to incarnate as Datta1treya.
<NI>Once there was a hermit called An2ima1n2d2avya (Ma1n2d2a-
<>vya). While the hermit was engaged in silent medi-
<>tation, some robbers passed by that way. The King's
<>men who were chasing the robbers, came to the hermit
<>and asked him about the robbers. The hermit did not
<>break the silence. The King's men, thinking the hermit
<>to be the thief bound his hands and legs and took him to
<>the palace. The King ordered Ma1n2d2avya to be killed by
<>piercing his body with a trident. Accordingly a trident
<>was posted on a hill far away and Ma1n2d2avya was seated [Page206-b+ 64]
<>on the tip of it. Ma1n2d2avya lay there in agony.
<NI>It was at this time that S4i1lavati1, famous for her conjugal
<>fidelity, went to the house of a harlot, carrying her
<>husband Ugras4ravas on her shoulder. When they passed
<>by that way Ugras4ravas scolded An2ima1n2d2avya; getting
<>angry at this An2ima1n2d2avya cursed Ugras4ravas that he
<>would get his head broken and die before the sun-rise.
<>Si1lavati1 became very sorry when she heard the curse
<>and she also cursed. “Let the sun not rise tomorrow”.
<>The sun did not rise next day. Everything in the world
<>was in chaos. The devas were flurried. They went to
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 took them to S4iva. They could not
<>find a solution. So all of them approached Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Trimu1rtis (three gods) told the devas that the
<>problem would be solved, and the devas returned.
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara went to S4i1lavati1. Before
<>seeing S4i1lavati1, they went to Anasu1ya1 the wife of Atri
<>and sought her help to persuade S4i1lavati1 to recall her
<>curse. Thus Anasu1ya1 and the Trimu1rtis approached
<>S4i1lavati1 and spoke compassionate and consolatory words.
<>At last S4i1lavati1 recalled the curse. The Trimu1rtis con-
<>vinced S4i1lavati1, that Ugras4ravas would not die. The
<>pleased Trimu1rtis asked Anasu1ya1 to ask for any boon. She
<>replied that she did not want any boon except that the
<>Trimu1rtis should take birth as her sons. Accordingly
<>Maha1vis2n2u took birth as Datta1treya, S4iva as Durva1sas
<>and Brahma1 as Candra, in the womb of Anasu1ya1. This
<>is how Datta1treya was born.
<F>1. Datta1treya is known by the name ‘Datta’ also in the Pura1n2as.</F> Datta1treya did penance
<>from his childhood and became a hermit. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 39 to 44).
<NI>2) {%Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and Datta1treya.%} When Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna became King Datta1treya had become very famous.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna wanted to obtain supernatural powers.
<>So he called the hermit Garga and asked for his advice.
<>Garga advised him that Datta1treya was the incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u and that he would grant his wishes. So Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna and his wife came to the river Narmada1,
<>and taking bath in the river, began to worship Datta1-
<>treya, who was doing penance closeby. Datta1treya
<>was pleased and went to Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and asked him
<>what his desire was. He requested for thousand hands
<>and to be a youth for ever, and such other things.
<>Datta1treya granted his wishes. After that Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna would very often go to the hermit Datta1treya for
<>his advice. (Brahma Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>3) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a went to the hermit-
<>age of Datta1treya. The hermit had placed a waterpot
<>purified by reciting spells and incantations. Ra1van2a
<>stole that waterpot. When the hermit knew this, he
<>cursed Ra1van2a saying, “Since the water, which was
<>evoked by spells and incantations, has fallen on your
<>head, Monkeys will pollute your head by treading on
<>it.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Exhortation to the Sa1dhyas.%} Mention is made in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 36, Stanza 4, that the
<>hermit Datta1treya gave exhortations to the Sa1dhyas (the
<>sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Sa1dhya1).
<NI>5) A boon for the birth of Nahus2a. See Nahus2a.
<HI>DATTOLI. A son born to hermit Pulastya by his wife
<>Pri1ti. This Dattoli was in his previous birth, Agastya of
<>the Sva1yam3bhuva manvantara. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a
<>1, Chapter 10).
<HI>DA1YAKRAMA. (INHERITANCE). Da1yakrama is [Page207-a+ 63]
<>the system by which the wealth of parents is received by
<>the heirs. The system of inheritance as described by Manu
<>is as follows:--
<NI>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should
<>divide their wealth among themselves. When either the
<>father or the mother is alive, the sons should not take
<>their wealth.
<NI>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should
<>keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his
<>brothers and sisters like a father.
<NI>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take one-
<>twentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part
<>and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance
<>is to be divided equally among all of them.
<NI>4) If there are more than three sons, the eldest and the
<>youngest may take one-twentieth and one-eightieth (of
<>the entire wealth) respectively, and each of the other
<>brothers may take one-fortieth. The rest of the pro-
<>perty must be divided equally among all of them.
<NI>5) After dividing like this, if there are unmarried sisters,
<>each of the brothers should give one-fourth of his share
<>for their marriage.
<NI>6) The ornaments which the mother had received by
<>way of her dowry etc. may be taken after her death by
<>her unmarried daughters.
<NI>7) If, after his marriage, one of the brothers dies, the
<>brother who keeps his movable and immovable proper-
<>ties, must beget children by the brother's wife and hand
<>over the above properties to her issue. (See under
<>Manusmr2ti).
<HI>D2AYA1NA1KS2ETRA. A famous temple of Goddess Diana
<>in Epheseus. In Greek mythology Diana (Daya1na1) is
<>the goddess of hunting. She is also identified with the
<>Moon Goddess. Being a virgin goddess, she came to be
<>worshipped by virgins who regarded her as their patron.
<>Daya1na1 (Diana) is one of the beautiful daughters of the
<>supreme God, Zeus. Her idol was worshipped in many
<>places in Greece. There was a famous temple of this god-
<>dess in the town of Epheseus. This temple was destroyed
<>in the 3rd Century B.C. by enemies.
<HI>DEVA(S). Gods or deities.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} From time immemorial belief in
<>Devas has existed in every country and all religions have
<>lauded their superior nature and power. It was the
<>Hindus and the Buddhists who first applied the term ‘Deva’
<>to certain very subtle beings recognised in all religions.
<>The Pa1rsi religion (Zaratus2t2ra) has spoken about seven
<>Devara1jans and their attendants. ‘Ames2 pentas’ is the
<>actual term used for the Devara1ja. The Christian reli-
<>gion refers to nine sects of Devas like Sra1fi, Kherubi,
<>Dominion, Angel etc. I1slam refers to four chief Devas
<>viz. Gabriel, the presiding Deva over revelations, Mik-
<>hayel of protection, Asriyal of death and Israfin of resur-
<>ruction. An important section of the R2gveda is Su1ktas
<>about Deva1s like Indra, Mitra, Varun2a, Agni etc. In
<>Yajn5as etc. Devas occupy a very important place. The
<>Kenopanis2ad states that the conceited and haughty Devas
<>were taught a lesson by God. The subject matter of the
<>Kat2hopanis2ad is the advice given by Yama to Naciketas.
<>The Mun2d2akopanis2ad says that the Devas, man and
<>birds originated from God.
<F>1. Tasma1cca deva1h2 bahudha1 samprasu1ta1h2 sa1dhya1h2 manus2ya1h2 pas4avo vaya1m3sah2.</F> There are references about
<>Deva worship in the Smr2tis. The Pura1n2as and Upapu- [Page207-b+ 62]
<>ra1n2as contain scientific discussions, about the origin,
<>work or functions, classes, etc. of Devas. The Mantra-
<>s4a1stra and Tantras4a1stra deal also about the various sects
<>and class of Devas, their nature, and the worship to be
<>offered to them etc.
<NI>2) {%Christian Devas, Satan and devils.%} Christian religious
<>books commonly use the term Ma1la1khas for Devas.
<>Greek mythology contains a story about the Ma1la1khas,
<>who did not obey the orders of Jehovah and how He
<>cursed them, turned them into devils and flung them into
<>hell. And, in hell they organised a revolutionary party
<>to fight Jehovah. Many leaders talked on the subject of
<>how to take vengeance on Jehovah. It was nearabout
<>this period that Jehovah created with the dust on earth
<>Adam as his beloved son and settled him in the garden of
<>Aden. God created from the ribs of Adam the woman
<>called Eve, and they lived in Eden quite happily.
<NI>Satan and other leaders in hell decided that the greatest
<>revenge that could be taken upon Jehovah was to create
<>troubles for his dear son, Adam in Eden. Accordingly
<>Satan went to Eden and made Adam and Eve eat the
<>forbidden fruit with the result that Jehovah cursed and
<>turned them into human beings and turned them out of
<>Eden. Milton in his reputed poem Paradise Lost has told
<>the above story in inimitable language.
<NI>3) {%Indian Devas.%} Most of the Indian Devas are the sons
<>of Kas4yapa Praja1pati by Aditi, daughter of Daks2a Praja1-
<>pati. The total number of Devas is 33 crores. The Devas
<>are divided into many classes or sections like A1dityas,
<>Vis4vadevatas, Vasus, Tus2itas, A1bha1svaras, Anilas, Maha1-
<>ra1jikas, Sa1dhyas, Rudras, Vidya1dharas, Pitr2devas etc.
<>There are further divisions like Apsaras, Viru1pa1ks2as,
<>Bhadras, Gandharvas, Kum3bha1n2d2as, Ra1ks2asas, Na1gas,
<>As4vini1s, Kinnaras, Kim3purus2as, Pis4a1cas, Guhyakas,
<>Siddhas, Ca1ran2as, Matr2s, Ku1s4ma1n2d2as, Bhu1tas, Veta1las,
<>etc. Yet another division is into Lokapa1las, Lipikas etc.
<>The Devas are classified with special reference to
<>bhu1tagan2as like Pr2thvi1 etc. and are, therefore, referred
<>to as Bhu1devata1s, Agnidevata1s, Va1yudevata1s, etc. The
<>presiding spirit of Bhu1devata1s is Kubera, that of the
<>Jaladevata1s is Varun2a, that of the Agnidevata1s, Va1yu-
<>bhagava1n and that of the A1ka1s4adevatas, Indra. And,
<>under them there are various sets of Devas in charge of
<>different departments. Sa1dhyas, Vasus, A1dityas, Apsaras
<>etc. are A1ka1s4adevas, Maruttas and Gandharvas,
<>Va1yudevas. Yaks2as and Yaks2i1s are servants of
<>Kubera. Viru1pa1ks2a, Bhadra etc. are Bhu1devas.
<>Viru1pa1ks2a supports the earth according to the Va1lmi1ki
<>Pura1n2a. Those who protect nidhis (treasures) may also
<>be considered Bhu1midevas.
<NI>There are 33 bosses or presiding spirits for the 33 crores
<>of Devas. Dva1das4a1dityas (12) Eka1das4arudras (11)
<>As2t2avasus (8) and As4vini1devas (2) are the 33 chiefs of
<>Devas. Indra is the chief of all of them.
<NI>4) {%The term Deva.%} The word Deva means light and
<>also play. Devas shine forth, they are also playful.
<>Thus the name is quite apt for them. (See Gra1ma-
<>devata1).
<HI>DEVABHA1GA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Navama Skandha).
<HI>DEVABHA1GAS4RAUTA1RS2A. A r2s2i, the son of S4ruta
<>and learned in yajn5as. He had accurate knowledge as to [Page208-a+ 64]
<>which parts of the yajn5a-cow should be distributed to
<>whom, and till death he did not impart this knowledge
<>to anyone. But, sometime afterwards a non-human
<>individual taught the subject to Girija, son of Babhru.
<>(Aitareya Bra1hman2a).
<NI>At the time when the Sr2n5jayas and the Kuru kings were
<>living in amity consequent upon the da1ks2a1yan2a yajn5a
<>it was this Devabha1ga who acted as the priest of both

<HI>DEVADA1SA. A rich Vais4ya extolled much in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara. He lived in Pa1taliput2ra and had married the
<>daughter of a very rich Vais4ya of Paun2d2ravardhana. After
<>his father's death Devada1sa lost all his wealth in gamb-
<>ling, and his wife foresook her impecunious husband and
<>returned home.
<NI>After roaming about for some time the helpless Devada1sa
<>decided to go to his wife's house, and one mid-night
<>he went there. While hiding himself there in the darkness
<>he heard his wife telling her paramour the following:
<>“In the four corners of Devada1sa's house are hidden
<>four treasures. But he does not know about the treasures
<>hidden thus by one of his fore-fathers. I got the informa-
<>tion from his mother. You should purchase the pro-
<>perty for a small price.”
<NI>No sooner did Devada1sa hear the above than he
<>hurried back to his house and dug up the treasure
<>and thus became wealthy again. The paramour of his
<>wife went to him a few days later and purchased the
<>property at a heavy price. But, when he dug up the
<>place no treasure was found. Then he wanted to sell
<>back the property to Devada1sa himself, but he refused
<>to purchase it. The case was taken before the King when
<>Devada1sa detailed the whole story. And, as ordered by
<>the King, Devada1sa disfigured his wife and wedded
<>another wife. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3bakam,
<>Taran3ga 5).
<HI>DEVADATTA I. A famous brahmin boy whose story is
<>described in the Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Devadatta was the son of the Brahmin, Haridatta of
<>Kambukapura. Though as a boy Devadatta learnt all
<>the arts and sciences when he grew up to be a youth he
<>became a very wayward fellow. Dice-play became his
<>main job. One day in a game of dice he lost even his
<>clothes, and being afraid of his father, he left the place
<>without returning home.
<NI>Devadatta roamed about, and during one such trip
<>he saw a deserted temple, and a muni called Ja1lapa1da
<>engaged in reciting mantras. Devadatta prostrated be-
<>fore the muni and told him all the details about himself.
<>The muni accepted Devadatta as his s4is2ya and promised
<>to secure vidya1dharahood for him.
<NI>Next night Ja1lapa1da led Devadatta to a burning ghat, [Page208-b+ 64]
<>nearby the temple. After conducting Pu1ja1 in the shade
<>of a fig tree with offerings of Pa1yasa and Vais4va-
<>devabali the muni told Devadatta thus: “You should
<>come here daily and perform pu1ja1 like this, and pray
<>at the close of it, ‘Oh! Vidyutprabha1! please accept my
<>pu1ja1.’
<NI>Devadatta acted according to the above advice of the
<>muni, and one day, at the close of his pu1ja1 the tree broke
<>open into two and a beautiful female who appeared from
<>it took him with her saying that her mistress wanted him.
<>He was thus taken to a house studded with gems wherein
<>he saw a noble lady seated on a cot. She caught Deva-
<>datta by his hands and after seating him alongside said
<>to him: “I am Vidyutprabha1, daughter of the Yaks2a
<>king Ratnavars2a. I am a virgin girl. Muni Ja1lapa1da
<>has worshipped me so much that I have decided to
<>fulfil his desire. I am in love with you and you will
<>please wed me.”
<NI>Accordingly Devadatta married Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>there with her. In due course she conceived, and Deva-
<>datta met Ja1lapa1da and told him about the whole
<>affair, and the muni, to achieve his personal object
<>asked Devadatta to cut open the abdomen of Vidyut-
<>prabha1 and take to him the child found therein. Deva-
<>datta did not at all relish the idea. Yet reluctant to
<>disobey his preceptor he returned to his wife. She permit-
<>ted him to carry out the directions of the muni, yet his
<>mind did not approve of the action. Then Vidyutprabha1
<>herself cut open her abdomen, took the child out of it
<>and placing it before her husband told him thus:--
<>“He who eats the child will become a Vidya1dhara.
<>Take it. I was a Vidya1dhari1 turned into a Yaks2i1 by a
<>curse, and to cut open my abdomen and take out the
<>child like this was the redemption promised me from the
<>curse, and now I go to the Vidya1dhara world; we shall
<>meet there.” And she disappeared.
<NI>In great sorrow Devadatta brought the child to Ja1la-
<>pa1da who, after sending him out on the pretext of his
<>(Ja1lapa1da's) performing Bhairavapu1ja, ate up the child.
<>Devadatta returned and when he knew of the action of
<>his preceptor he was overcome with rage. But the latter
<>rose up to the skies assuming the form of a Vidya1dhara.
<>Devadatta made up his mind to anyhow take revenge
<>upon Ja1lapa1da, and he also went to Vidya1dharaloka with
<>the help of a Veta1la whom he befriended by offering
<>human flesh. And, there he saw Ja1lapa1da drunk with
<>pride at his Vidya1dharahood sitting on a throne of
<>gems in a mansion. Meanwhile Vidyutprabha1 who was
<>now once more a Vidya1dhari1 had turned down the
<>advances made by the erstwhile Ja1lapa1da for her love.
<>But, at the sight of Devadatta her face flushed with love
<>for him while, in fear, the sword fell down from the
<>hands of Ja1lapa1da who now fainted. Devadatta pre-
<>vented the Veta1la from killing Ja1lapa1da and he (Veta1la)
<>at the instance of Devadatta took Ja1lapa1da to the burn-
<>ing ghat and cremated him there.
<NI>Ka1tya1yani1devi1 at this time appeared before Devadatta
<>and pleased with his courage appointed him as chief of
<>the Vidya1dharas. He wedded Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>happily. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Caturda1rika1lam3bakam3,
<>Taran3ga 3).
<HI>DEVADATTA II. A king of ancient India, son of King
<>Jayadatta. Jayadatta wanted to marry his son Devadatta
<>to the daughter of a Vais4ya in Pa1t2ali1putra. Though it [Page209-a+ 65]
<>was a far cry from Pa1t2ali1putra to Jayadatta's court the
<>Vais4ya married his daughter to the prince as he attached
<>much importance to such an alliance with the King.
<>From the dowry given by the Vais4ya to his daughter
<>the resources of her father appeared to be very meagre
<>to Devadatta.
<NI>After some time Devadatta's wife returned to her house
<>with the permission of her husband. During her absence
<>Jayadatta expired, enemies attacked his kingdom and
<>Devadatta with his mother ran away from his kingdom.
<>Sometime after that he started for his wife's house. But,
<>feeling that it would not be proper for him to personally
<>tell his father-in-law about what had happened to him
<>he waited outside an inn near his wife's house, and he
<>had not waited there for long when he saw a woman
<>descending by a cord from the other door of the house.
<>He felt deeply mortified to detect that it was his wife
<>who was thus descending. And, when she, not recognis-
<>ing Devadatta in his dirty clothes, asked him who he
<>was, he answered a ‘traveller’. Taking no notice of this
<>‘traveller’ she got into the inn, and Devadatta followed
<>her. Inside the inn she was met by a man who beat her
<>for being late to go to him; but, in spite of the beating
<>she pleased him with coy words. Then and there Deva-
<>datta divorced her in his mind, but remained there
<>observing their love-making. In the course of their love-
<>play an ear-ring studded with costly gems rolled down
<>the floor from her ears, but she did not notice it. She
<>parted from her paramour before dawn. Devadatta
<>went to Ka1nyakubja with the ear-ring, and there he
<>pledged it for one lakh sovereigns with which money he
<>collected an army and conquered back his lost kingdom.
<>Then he redeemed the pledge and sent the ear-ring to
<>his father-in-law. The whole incident became public.
<>When she realised the fact that the stranger whom she
<>had met at the inn was her own husband, Devadatta's
<>wife felt so deeply hurt and humiliated that her heart was
<>broken and she died. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Narava1hana-
<>datta Janana, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>DEVADATTA III. Father of the reputed muni Utatthya.
<>(Satyatapas). (See Satyatapas.)
<HI>DEVADATTA(M). The divine conch of Arjuna. Maya
<>got this conch from Varun2a and he kept it in the sabha1
<>of Vr2s2aparvan, which was in Bindusaras on Mount
<>Maina1ka to the south of Mount Kaila1sa. When Maya
<>built the palace at Indraprastha for the Pa1n2d2avas he
<>went to Bindusaras and brought for Arjuna that conch
<>called Devadattam, and a club for Bhi1masena. (Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>In the battle of Kuruks2etra Arjuna mounted a white
<>horse and blew his conch Devadattam. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 14).
<HI>DEVA1DHIPA. A king who in his previous life was an
<>asura. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 26).
<HI>DEVADU1TA. A messenger of the Devas. When Dharma-
<>putra refused to live in heaven without his brothers
<>like Karn2a it was this Devadu1ta with whom Indra sent
<>Dharmaputra to Karn2a and others. (M.B. Svarga1-
<>rohan2a Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 14). This Devadu1ta
<>is to be meditated upon at dawn and before sun-set
<>everyday. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 165, Verse 14).
<HI>DEVADYUMNA. A king of the dynasty of Bharata.
<>From Bharata, son of R2s2abha, was born Sumati, from

<>Devadyumna was the grand-father of King Prati1pa and [Page209-b+ 65]
<>father of King Parames2t2hi. (Bha1gavata Pan5cama
<>Skandha).
<HI>DEVADYUTI. A R2s2i who dwelt in his a1s4rama on the
<>banks of river S4arasvati1. Owing to the blessing of Vis2n2u
<>a son called Sumitra was born to him. As a result of his
<>doing rigorous tapas for 1000 years he shone with a
<>rare effulgence. Though Vis2n2u appeared to him one
<>day in the month of Vais4a1kha and asked him to choose
<>any boon he wanted, he, who was so much detached in
<>life prayed only for devotion to God. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 212).
<HI>DEVAGAN2A. See Manvantara.
<HI>DEVAGARBHA. A R2s2i. He too was present as one of

<>Rucipraja1pati and Devahu1ti by Kardamapraja1pati
<>and Prasu1ti to Daks2praja1pati. Kapila, the mighty
<>exponent of the Sa1n3khya system of philosophy and great
<>ascetic was the son born to Kardama by Devahu1ti.
<>Kapila taught his mother the world famous Kapila
<>S4a1stra, (Devibha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha) and when the
<>teaching was over he bade farewell to her and took to
<>forest life. And, his mother performed a yajn5a on the
<>lines advised by her son, on the banks of river Sarasvati1.
<>Because she took three baths daily her hairs became a
<>mixture of black and blue in colour and she got emacia-
<>ted due to fasting. She wore the bark of trees. Deva-
<>hu1ti, who realised all the principles and the truth be-
<>came blind to all external objects like gardens, maids,
<>mansions etc. Thus immersed in meditation she in
<>course of time attained siddhi (realisation). The parti-

<>Upadeva1, S4ri1deva1, Devaraks2ita1, Sahadeva1 and Devaki1.
<>Devaki1 was married to Vasudeva. The statement that
<>Devaki1 and Kam3sa were sister and brother is not fully
<>correct. Kam3sa was the son of Ugrasena, the brother of
<>Devaka. Devaki1 was the grand-daughter of Devaka.
<>Certain Pura1n2as refer to Devaki1 as the daughter of
<>Devaka. According to them Kam3sa and Devaki1 were
<>children of the elder and the younger brothers respecti-
<>vely. According to the Agni Pura1n2a Devaki1 was the
<>niece of Kam3sa. Thus it is equally correct to say that
<>between Kam3sa and Devaki1 there was brother-sister
<>relationship as also uncle-niece relationship.
<NI>2) {%Devaki1 in previous birth.%} Devaki1 in her previous birth
<>was Aditi, the daughter of Daks2a and wife of Kas4yapa-
<>praja1pati. (See Aditi, Parva 3).
<NI>3) {%Marriage and children.%} Vasudeva, the Ya1dava married
<>Devaki1. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was their eighth child. Six sons of
<>theirs born elder to Kr2s2n2a were killed by Kam3sa. (See
<>Kam3sa, Para 2). The seventh child, from the very
<>womb itself of Devaki1 was passed on to the womb of
<>Rohin2i1, who was another wife of Vasudeva. Balabhadra
<>was the child thus born to Rohin2i1. The eighth child

<>disciples of Vya1sa. (M.B. Prathama Skandha).
<NI>Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a contains the following story

<>the result of a boon granted by S4iva. Ram3bha1, the
<>heavenly dancer fell in love with him. But, Devala did
<>not reciprocrate her love. So, she cursed him to become
<>crooked in body. When he became crooked thus he
<>came to be called As2t2a1vakra. For six thousand years he
<>did penance after which Kr2s2n2a and Ra1dha1 appeared to
<>him. Ra1dha1 laughed at the uncouth form of As2t2a1vakra.
<>But, Kr2s2n2a admonished her and embraced him. At once
<>his bodily crookedness disappeared and he became very
<>handsome. A vima1na then descended from heaven,

<>kas like Indra should be installed at the eight places
<>starting with the east. In Pan5ca1yatana pratis2t2ha1 Puru-
<>s2ottama should be installed at the centre. Maha1laks2mi1
<>and Vais4ravan2a are to be installed to the east of the
<>Pra1sa1da, and the Ma1tr2s in the south. Subrahman2ya,
<>Gan2apati, I1s4a1na and the planets (grahas2) like Sun
<>should be installed in the west. Das4a1vata1ramu1rtis (ten
<>incarnations of Vis2n2u) should be installed in the North.
<>Can2d2ika1 should be installed in Agni's zone, Sarasvati1
<>in Va1yu's zone, Ambi1ka1 in Nirr2ti's zone and S4ri1 Bhaga-
<>vati1 in I1s4a1na zone. In temples with thirteen A1layas
<>Vis2n2u should be installed at the centre. Mu1rtis like
<>Kes4ava should be in the east.
<NI>Devapratima1s (idols) are of seven varieties like those
<>made of earth, of wood, of metals, of gems, of sandal
<>wood, of stone and of flowers. Of the above, idols made
<>of earth, sandalwood and of flowers are meant only for
<>temporary use, but they also grant all the desires of the
<>devotees.
<NI>Stone for idols should be got from mountains. Pa1n2d2ura
<>(white), Arun2a (red), Pi1ta (yellow) and Kr2s2n2a (black)-
<>rocks having any one of these four colours may be
<>selected. If no such stone is available any other stone
<>may be used, but by doing homa and reciting Narasim3ha
<>mantra the attributes of any of the specified varn2as
<>should be transferred to it. It is best to have white
<>markings on the stone selected for the idol. There are
<>the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter with
<>reference to stones. Stone which produces the sound of
<>bell metal on being hit and gives out sparks of fire on
<>being cut is of the masculine gender. Stone which
<>possesses these attributes to a lesser degree is of the
<>feminine gender. Stone with no shape is of neuter gen-
<>der. Beside these three varieties there are the sagarbha
<>(pregnant) stones also, viz. stones with round markings
<>on them, and they should not be used for making idols.
<>Once it is decided to make an idol, Vanayajn5a should
<>be performed first. To worship the forest from which
<>the stone for the idol was to be obtained is vanayajn5a.
<>A specified place in the forest should be dug up, the
<>pit treated with cow-dung and a small platform raised
<>and Vis2n2u worshipped thereon. After sacrificial offerings
<>etc. instruments for the construction of the idol like
<>t2an3ka (chisel) should be worshipped. To sprinkle on
<>the stone s4a1litoya (water in which paddy grains are
<>put) purified with the chanting of astramantra is the
<>next step. After that bhu1tabali (offerings to the spirits
<>of the stone) should be performed upon which the
<>bhu1tas residing inside the stone will quit. Then the
<>a1ca1rya should go to sleep repeating the svapna mantra.

<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 I. A very reputed muni. He had a wife
<>called Ruci and a disciple called Vipula. (See Vipula
<>III).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 II. A Brahmin, an erudite scholar in the
<>Vedas. His story was once told to Pa1rvati1 by S4iva as
<>follows:--
<NI>Devas4arman, the very erudite brahmin scholar in the
<>Vedas came to be much respected by the people of the
<>four varn2as (Castes) because of his constant and unfail-
<>ing performance of the various religious duties and
<>rites like the Agnihotra etc. He had sons, relations and
<>cows in abundance. But, he did not observe the s4ukla-
<>pan5cami1 in Pros2t2hapada (Bha1drapada) which is one of [Page212-b+ 65]
<>the dva1das4aca1ndra ma1sas (the 12 solar months).
<>That day was his father's death anniversary (S4ra1ddha
<>day) for which he would invite Brahmins on the pre-
<>vious evening. And, in the morning he would get cook-
<>ed rice by his wife in 18 different ways for the gratifica-
<>tion of the departed soul. Then will he feed the
<>Bra1hmins. On one such day he duly treated a Bra1hmin
<>versed in the Vedas. In the evening when he
<>was washing his feet with water brought by his wife
<>he heard the following conversation between a dog
<>and an ox.
<NI>{%Dog :%}--Please attend to my words about what my
<>daughter-in-law did. One day, as fate would have it,
<>I went to my son's house, where a snake was drinking
<>milk, and I drank the whole of the milk which was left
<>over by it. My daughter-in-law saw me drinking it and
<>I was absolutely crest-fallen. I don't feel any yearning
<>even for food.
<NI>{%Ox :%}--Now dog, please attend to my sorrow and grief.
<>Today my son feasted the Brahmins, but he did not even
<>think of me. Nobody gave me even a blade of grass or
<>a drop of water. I have not tasted anything today.
<>Moreover I am a captive also. All this must be the result
<>of some sin committed by me in my past life; no doubt
<>about it.”
<NI>The very learned and intelligent brahmin inferred from
<>the above talk that the dog and ox were his mother and
<>his father respectively. He thought to himself: they have
<>been born as animals in my house. What remedy shall
<>I find out therefor?
<NI>On account of such painful thoughts the Brahmin could
<>not sleep in the night. Early in the morning he went
<>to sage Vasis2t2ha and unburdened his heart to him and
<>requested him to find a solution to the low and mean
<>birth which had become his parents’ fate. After medita-
<>ting for some time the great sage told the brahmin as
<>follows:--
<NI>“Look here, the ox was, in its previous birth, a great
<>brahmin in Kun2d2inanagara. He did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada, the day
<>being the death anniversary of his father. His wife had
<>menstruation on the same day, but she herself feasted
<>the Brahmins. A woman is impure during the four days
<>of menstruation. Because of having feasted the Brah-
<>mins on the first day of her monthly period the Brah-
<>min's wife was born as a dog. As for the husband, he
<>was born an ox as he not only did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 day, but also shared the sin of his wife.
<>Further questioned by the brahmin as to what he should
<>do for the salvation of his parents, Vasis2t2ha advised him
<>to observe the R2s2i pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada
<>(Bha1drapada). He did so and his parents blessed him
<>and attained salvation. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 78).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 III. (See Mitrabheda).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 IV. The hero of a story told by Vis2n2u-
<>s4arman.
<NI>Vis2n2us4arman, the intelligent preceptor, told five stories
<>based on five tactics to educate the five dull sons of
<>emperor Sudars4ana. The fifth tactics is called asam3prek-
<>s2yaka1ritva. He told two important stories to illustrate
<>the dangers, which would happen to those who act in
<>haste and in anger, without patiently attempting to
<>find out the truth. Devas4arman is the hero of one of
<>the stories.
<NI>{%Story one.%} Once upon a time there lived in Gaud2ades4a [Page213-a+ 65]
<>a brahmin called Devas4arman with his wife Yajn5asena1.
<>When his wife got pregnant Devas4arman told her that a
<>good and lucky son would be born to them to which she
<>replied as follows:--“On no account build castles in
<>the air and brood over things. I shall tell you a story
<>about a danger which happened to one who built
<>castles in the air. A brahmaca1ri1 was carrying home in
<>a pot on his head some rice flour. On the way he
<>thought thus: “I will purchase a she-goat with the
<>money I get out of the sale of this rice powder, and
<>it will deliver two kids every year. I will sell all the
<>kids and with the sale proceeds purchase a cow and
<>when it multiplies I will have the wherewithals for cul-
<>tivation and then I will do cultivation in a good field
<>and produce much paddy. And when I have thus money
<>in hand I will renovate my house and marry. We will
<>then have a good son whom I will name Somas4arman,
<>and if my wife, without caring for the boy, goes to milk
<>the cow I will go to the cow shed and give her a good
<>beating. “When his imagination reached this point the
<>pot on his head received, without his knowing, a blow
<>with the stick in his hand and it fell down on the ground
<>and was broken to pieces.”
<NI>Five or six days after telling the above story to her
<>husband Yajn5asena1 gave birth to a child. One day she
<>went to the river to take her bath leaving the child
<>to the care of her husband. Soon after a messenger came
<>from the palace to invite Devas4arman for food, the day
<>being Ama1vasi1 when Brahmins were fed well and also
<>given daks2in2a1, (presents of money). He could not wait
<>till his wife arrived; the child became a problem to
<>him.
<NI>The brahmin had a beloved Mongoose. After entrusting
<>the child to the care of it the Brahmin went to the
<>palace. Within a short time a serpent was seen crawling
<>towards the child and the Mongoose attacked it and
<>bit it into pieces. Naturally the Mongoose got itself
<>smeared all over with the blood of the serpent, and the
<>brahmin on returning home finding the Mongoose bath-
<>ed in blood thought it might have eaten the child
<>and in a rage he killed the poor Mongoose. But, when
<>he entered the room and found pieces of the killed ser-
<>pent strayed all over there truth and light dawned on
<>him. Yajn5asena1, who had returned after bath by now
<>also found fault with him.
<NI>{%The second story.%} Once there was a Brahmin in very indi-
<>gent circumstances. He was an orphan from his very
<>childhood. One day while he was asleep quite weary
<>and tired as he had no food that day some one
<>appeared and told him in a dream that three sannya1sins
<>would come to his house that noon and that if beaten to
<>death they would turn into three pot-fulls of treasure
<>with which he could live comfortably well.
<NI>His dream came true, and he locked up the treasure in
<>his room after sending away a barber who had witnessed
<>the incident with a piece of gold. The barber returned
<>home cherishing in his mind the false belief that sann-
<>ya1sins beaten to death would turn into pot-fulls of
<>treasure. And, one day some sannya1sins came to his
<>house and he began beating them and they ran out
<>crying aloud. Their cries attracted the attention of the
<>servants of the King. The barber's limbs were cut off
<>and he was killed on S4u1la (a three-pronged weapon).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 V. A Brahmin, who used to perform rites
<>for the dead at the confluence of the sea every fortnight. [Page213-b+ 65]
<NI>On every such occasion souls of the departed used to ap-
<>pear and bless him. Once Devas4arman went to Pitr2loka
<>with his pitr2s, and he got restless and sorry to find other
<>pitr2s living there in greater comfort than the pitr2s of
<>his parents. When he was told that the better fate of
<>the other pitr2s was due to their sons performing S4ra1ddha
<>at Mahi1sa1garasan3gama he returned to earth and with the
<>help of other people did S4ra1ddha at the san3gamaand
<>thus raised the condition of his pitr2s. (Skandha Pura1n2a.
<>Skandhas 1, 2 and 3).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 VI. A Brahmin who lived on the nor-
<>thern side of river Ka1veri1. The following story about
<>him is told in chapters 2, 4 and 12 of the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>One day in the month of Ka1rttika he asked his son to
<>bathe. The son refused to obey his father, who got
<>angry at the disobedience of the son and cursed him to be
<>turned into a rat. But, when the son begged his pardon
<>he said that the boy would resume his old form when
<>he heard about the greatness of Ka1rttika.
<NI>While the Brahmin, thus turned into rat, was roaming
<>about in the forest it saw Vis4va1mitra mahars2i seated
<>under a tree with his disciples. The mahars2i was telling
<>the disciples about the greatness of Ka1rttika. The Brah-
<>min boy--turned cat--heard the story and reverted to
<>its old form as the Brahmin boy.
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 VII. See Ma1ya1 S4iva.
<HI>DEVASATTRA(M). A yajn5a. (See Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 84, Verse 68).
<HI>DEVASENA I. A very intelligent king who ruled his
<>country with S4ra1vasti1 as his capital. (See Unma1dini1).
<HI>DEVASENA. II. Husband of Ki1rtisena1. (See Ki1rtisena1).
<HI>DEVASENA1. Daks2a's daughter and wife of Subrah-
<>man2ya and a woman of rare beauty and purity. Dait-
<>yasena1 and Devasena1, daughters of Daks2a, used to
<>enjoy themselves at Ma1nasa saras. One day Kes4i1, the
<>asura saw them and craved for their love. Daityasena1
<>agreed to become his wife, but Devasena1 refused, and
<>she prayed for the help of Indra, who happened to
<>come there at the moment. Indra and Kes4i1 fought
<>with each other. Kes4i1 used the club against Indra, who
<>broke it into two with his vajra1yudha. Then Kes4i1 hurled
<>a mountain at Indra, who cut it also. Frightened to
<>death Kes4i1 then ran away with Daityasena1 to safety,
<>and Devasena1 expressed her desire to Indra to have
<>one who could defeat the Devas, Da1navas and Yaks2as
<>as her husband. But, Indra could not find such a one
<>in the whole universe. Indra told Brahma1 about it.
<>The Devas put their heads together and brought forth
<>Subrahman2ya from S4iva to be her husband. In the
<>war between the Devas and the asuras Devasena1 helped
<>Subrahman2ya, and the asuras were completely destro-
<>yed. (Vana Parva, Chapters 223, 224).
<HI>DEVAS4I1LA1. See Gaya1ti1rtha.
<HI>DEVASMITA1. A Gem of a woman who was much devoted
<>to her husband. The story of Devasmita1 has been so
<>often quoted in ancient Indian literature. She was the
<>daughter of a Vais4ya called Dharmagupta and was
<>married to Guhasena, son of a Vais4ya called Dhana-
<>datta, who belonged to Ta1mraliptinagara.
<NI>After the death of his father Guhasena decided to go to
<>Kat2a1hadvi1pa for trade, and Devasmita1, a very suspici-
<>ous wife, objected to it. When his other relations began
<>pressing him to go to the dvi1pa for trade and his wife
<>not to go, Guhasena could not take a decision on the [Page214-a+ 65]
<>matter. He began a penance so that God might take
<>the decision in the matter. Devasmita1 also followed
<>him. Then God appeared to them in their dreams
<>and gave each of them a red lotus flower saying, “both
<>of you keep one flower each with you, and while both
<>of you are away from each other if either of you go
<>astray the lotus flower in the hands of the other
<>person will fade.” And, on awaking both of them had
<>a flower in their hands. Guhasena with his flower in
<>his hands started for Kat2a1hadvi1pa, and Devasmita1 sta-
<>yed at home with her eyes fixed on her lotus flower.
<>Guhasena reached the dvi1pa and traded in gems. Every-
<>body was surprised to find in his hands a lotus flower
<>which never faded. Four Vais4ya youngsters wanted to
<>understand the secret of it and one day they invited
<>Guhasena to their house and treated him to liquor very
<>liberally. When he got absolutely drunk they question-
<>ed him about the secret of the lotus flower, and he,
<>though in indistinct words, explained it to them. When
<>the secret was thus out all the four youngsters decided
<>to seduce his wife. They extracted from him the infor-
<>mation that he was not returning in the near future,
<>and they then came to Ta1mralipti.
<NI>At that time there lived in Ta1mralipti a bogus Sannya1-
<>sini1 (a female anchorite) called Yogakaran2d2ika1. The four
<>youths from Kat2a1hadvi1pa visited her, and she under-
<>took to fulfil their desire. She asked them to halt at her
<>house and then went to Devasmita1 with some refreshments.
<>Devasmita1's bitch barked very violently at the bogus an-
<>chorite when she told the former thus:--“Child! don't
<>you see the bitch barking at my very sight. The bitch is
<>crying thinking of her previous birth at my sight. Her-
<>self (the bitch) and I were, in our last birth, the wives
<>of a Brahmin. Since our husband was a courtier at the
<>palace often he was away from home and in his absence
<>I used to satisfy the cravings of sex by associating freely
<>with other males. I had even at that time realised the
<>truth that there was no duty higher than satisfying the
<>senses, and so I am now reborn with memories of the
<>past life. As for this bitch in her past life as co-wife with
<>me of the Brahmin, she sinned against her sense-organs
<>by upholding, in ignorance, her chastity, as a punish-
<>ment for which she was born as dog in this life. Yet, she
<>remembers her past.
<NI>Though Devasmita1 saw through the false and trea-
<>cherous heart of the bogus anchorite, without expres-
<>sing it she talked in all respect with her. Believing that
<>she had succeeded in her mission she told Devasmita1
<>about the four youths who had come from Kat2a1ha-
<>dvi1pa, and Devasmita1 welcomed the idea very gladly.
<NI>Devasmita1 got some liquor and mixed poison in it.
<>When it was night one of the Vais4ya youths came, and
<>after rendering him unconscious by administering the
<>poisoned liquor to him Devasmita1 stripped him of all
<>his clothes and ornaments, got him scratched on the
<>brows by the bitch and threw him into a cow dung
<>heap. Before it was dawn next day he returned to the
<>anchorite's house, took a bath and dressed himself up in
<>decent clothings. His other three companions also visi-
<>ted Devasmita1 one after the other in the next three
<>days, and they too underwent the same experience as the
<>first one. Lastly the bogus sannya1sini1 also was got down
<>and Devasmita1 cut her limbs and sent her away. And,
<>after this Devasmita1 put on the garb of a merchant and
<>went to Kat2a1hadvi1pa and identified her husband from [Page214-b+ 65]
<>among a thousand merchants. Guhasena too felt his
<>own doubts about her identity. But, without revealing
<>her identity she saw the king and told him that she had
<>certain matters to submit before the praja1paris2at (popu-
<>lar assembly). The King accordingly convened a session
<>of the assembly and Devasmita1 identified the four youths
<>who had tried to seduce her and submitted all details
<>regarding the episode. The King then gave her a lot of
<>money, appointed the four youths as her servants and
<>sent her back home with Guhasena. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Katha1mukhalam3bakam, Taran3ga 5).

<HI>DEVA1SURAYUDDHA(S) Wars between the gods and
<>asuras. Altogether twelve wars were fought between
<>the Devas and the asuras, viz. Narasim3ha, Va1mana,
<>Vara1ha, Amr2tamathana, Ta1raka1maya, A1d2i1baka, Trai-
<>pura, Andhaka, Vadha, Vr2travadha, Dhvajapa1ta,
<>Ha1la1hala and Kola1hala. Hiran2yakas4ipu, the daitya
<>was killed by Narasim3ha. Va1mana took Maha1bali
<>captive after measuring the three worlds in one stride.
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a was killed in fighting in the sea by Vara1ha
<>with its tusks. Indra defeated Prahla1da and in the
<>Ta1raka1maya war also killed his son Virocana who had
<>planned to kill him (Indra). As the Devas could not
<>kill the da1navas of Tripura, Trilocana killed them.
<>Vr2tra who was aided by the da1navas was killed by
<>Indra with the help of Vis2n2u. Indra himself killed
<>Vipracitti and his followers who became invisible by
<>ma1ya1 after the felling of the dhvaja (flag staff), and in
<>the course of celebrating their victory the Devas defeat-
<>ed S4an2d2a1marka at the yajn5a1vabhr2tha (Bathing at the
<>close of the yajn5a). Thus were waged twelve wars
<>between the Devas and the Asuras. (Padma Pura1n2a,

<>viz. Merudevi1, Pratiru1pa1, Ugradam3s2t2ri1, Lata1, Ramya1,
<>Sya1ma1, Na1ri1, Bhadra1 and Devavi1ti. Thus Devavi1ti be-
<>came the wife of Ketuma1la. (Bha1gavata, Pan5cama
<>Skandha).
<HI>DEVAVRATA I. Bhi1s2ma (See Bhi1s2ma for details).
<HI>DEVAVRATA II. A brahmin who believed in yajn5as.
<>He once received without due regard and with indif-
<>ference the ti1rtha water given to him by a devotee of
<>Kr2s2n2a after worship of the Lord, as a result of which,
<>in the next birth, he was born as a bamboo stem. And,
<>as he did, consciously or otherwise some good deeds S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a made a flute out of that bamboo stem, and
<>Devavrata thus attained redemption. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 73).
<HI>DEVA1VR2DHA I. A warrior, who fought against the
<>Pa1n2d2avas in the Kuruks2etra war (Karn2a Parva, Chap-
<>ter 85, Verse 3).
<HI>DEVA1VR2DHA II. A king who, along with his subjects
<>attained heaven as he had made a gift of a golden
<>umbrella. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 234, Verse 21).
<HI>DEVAYAJANAM. The place called Praya1ga which is
<>considered to be the ya1jn5ic centre of the Devas. Amba1,
<>daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1 did rigorous tapas here.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 186, Verse 27).
<HI>DEVAYA1JI1. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Verse 7).
<HI>DEVAYA1NI1. Sukra1ca1rya's daughter.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Sva1yambhuvamanu, son of Brahma1 had two
<>sons: Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da. Priyavrata wedded
<>Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1, two very beautiful daughters
<>of Vis4vakarmapraja1pati, and he had by Suru1pa1 ten
<>sons called Agni1dhra, Idhmajihva1, Yajn5aba1hu,
<>Maha1vi1ra, Rukmasukra, Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1-
<>tithi, Vi1tihotra and Kavi as also a daughter called
<>U1rjasvati1 who was the youngest of the whole lot. Of
<>the above ten sons Kavi, Savana and Maha1vi1ra were
<>spiritual giants and great sages. Uttama, Ta1pasa and
<>Raivata, the three sons of Priyavrata by his second wife
<>Barhis2mati1 turned out to be manvantara1dhipatis.
<>U1rjasvati1, the only daughter of Priyavrata was married
<>to S4ukra1ca1rya, preceptor of the asuras. Devaya1ni1 was
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's daughter by U1rjasvati1. (Devi1bha1gavata,
<>As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Curse by Kaca.%} Kaca, son of Br2haspati became
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's disciple to learn Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 vidya1
<>(the science to ward off death for ever). Devaya1ni1
<>fell madly in love with Kaca. But, after his studies
<>under her father were over Kaca returned to devaloka
<>without marrying Devaya1ni1, who cursed that Kaca's [Page215-b+ 65]
<>learning should prove useless. And, Kaca cursed her
<>in return that nobody from devaloka should marry
<>her. (For details see Kaca).
<NI>3) {%Devaya1ni1 in a neglected well.%} Once Vr2s2aparvan was the
<>king of the asuras, and S4ukra1ca1rya lived in his palace.
<>S4armis2t2ha1, the daughter of the king and Devaya1ni1, the
<>daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya became thick friends. While
<>one day these two friends with their companions were
<>engaged in water sports Indra came that way. Very
<>much interested in seeing the deva damsels thus engaged
<>in water sports Indra assumed the form of air and blew
<>off the dresses of the damsels from the shore while they
<>were playing in the river. The damsels hurriedly got
<>out of water, ran after the fleeing garments and put
<>on whatever came to their hands. In the confusion what
<>S4armis2t2ha1 got and wore was Devaya1ni1's clothes. Devaya1ni1
<>ran after S4armis2t2ha1 and caught hold of the clothes, but
<>the latter did not yield them to her. Both of them
<>indulged in hot words against each other, S4armis2t2ha1
<>calling S4ukra1ca1rya a beggar living in her father's
<>palace for his food. Not only that, she pushed Devaya1ni1
<>into a neglected well and went her way.
<NI>At that time prince Yaya1ti, son of Nahus2a, was hunting
<>in that forest. Feeling very thirsty he came to the well
<>for a drink and therein saw Devaya1ni1 in tears. He
<>brought her out from the well and leaving her there
<>went on his way.
<NI>S4ukra1ca1rya and his wife actually got anxious and upset
<>that their daughter had not returned even after the
<>lapse of so much time and deputed their servant
<>Gurn2ika1 to seek for Devaya1ni1. She found her out in
<>the forest. But, Devaya1ni1 refused to return home as
<>she did not want to continue as the daughter of one
<>who lived on the charity of S4armis2t2ha1 and her father.
<>Gurn2ika1 carried back this news to S4ukra1ca1rya, who then
<>went himself to the forest and met his daughter. He
<>felt deeply wounded to hear about the insults heaped
<>on his daughter by S4armis2t2ha1, and sent word to
<>Vr2s2aparvan that they were not returning to the palace.
<>Vr2s2aparvan realised that if S4ukra1ca1rya quarrelled
<>with him the whole asura world also would become
<>divided. He, therefore, tried his best to pacify the
<>a1ca1rya and his daughter. At last Devaya1ni1 agreed to re-
<>turn to the palace in case S4armis2t2ha1 went to her with one
<>thousand of her maids to serve as her (Devaya1ni1's) maids.
<>Vr2s2aparvan acted accordingly and Devaya1ni1 was
<>satisfied and returned to the palace with her father.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 78 onwards.)
<NI>4) {%Wedding of Devaya1ni1.%} Some time afterwards when
<>Devaya1ni1 was sporting in the forest with S4armis2t2ha1 and
<>others, King Yaya1ti happened to pass that way. They
<>recognised each other and Devaya1ni1 requested Yaya1ti
<>to marry her as she had mentally chosen him as her
<>husband on the very same day on which he had saved
<>her from the well.
<NI>Yaya1ti realised only too well that it was really danger-
<>ous to marry the daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya in the forest
<>secretly and he, therefore, rejected Devaya1ni1's request.
<>But, she got down her father there and with his per-
<>mission Yaya1ti married her. He also got much wealth
<>by way of dowry. S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids accompanied
<>Devaya1ni1 but Sukra1ca1rya warned Yaya1ti that on no
<>account should he touch S4armis2t2ha1.
<NI>With his wife and her attendants Yaya1ti returned to
<>his palace; but he put S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids in [Page216-a+ 70]
<>a place newly built for the purpose. Devaya1ni1 delivered
<>a child in due course and it was named Yadu. S4armis2-
<>t2ha1 one day met Yaya1ti in the forest and requested
<>for a child by him. Though at first he was reluctant to
<>oblige remembering only too well the injunction of
<>S4ukra1ca1rya, he at last succumbed to the eloquence of
<>S4armis2t2ha1. She got pregnant by him and the child
<>she delivered was called Druhyu.
<NI>Devaya1ni1 was alarmed at the birth of a child to
<>S4armis2t2ha, who was unmarried, and questioned her
<>about it. S4armis2t2ha1's answer that a brahmin stranger,
<>who came that way was the father of her child satisfied
<>Devaya1ni1.
<NI>Ere long another son, Turvasu, was born to Devaya1ni1,
<>and S4armis2t2ha1 too delivered two children called
<>Anudruhyu and Pu1ru. Thus the mistress (Devaya1ni1)
<>had two sons and her servant, S4armis2t2ha1 three sons.
<NI>While Yaya1ti and Devaya1ni1 were one day strolling in
<>the garden the sons of S4armis2t2ha1 came there. She
<>noticed the close resemblance of those boys to her
<>husband (Yaya1ti) and it kindled her wrath. Though
<>Yaya1ti did not, because of the presence of Devaya1ni1,
<>notice the children, when she asked them who their
<>father was, they answered “Yaya1ti”, whereupon in
<>great rage she ran up to her father. Yaya1ti too followed
<>her. Devaya1ni1 told her father about the infidelity of
<>Yaya1ti and he (S4ukra) cursed that Yaya1ti be afflicted
<>with old age. When Yaya1ti asked for redumption from
<>the curse S4ukra1ca1rya told him that he could exchange
<>his old age for the youth of somebody else.
<NI>Yaya1ti then called together all his five sons and asked
<>them whether anyone of them was prepared to exchange
<>his (son's) youth for his (Yaya1ti's) old age for one
<>thousand years. The three elder sons refused to agree
<>to the proposal, but the fourth son Pu1ru gladly exchan-
<>ged his youth with his father's old age. After spending
<>his life in youthful enjoyment for one thousand
<>years Yaya1ti returned his youth to Pu1ru, and Pu1ru
<>assumed Kingship of the country. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>81-83).
<NI>5) {%Synonyms for Devaya1ni1.%} Aus4anasi1, S4ukratanaya1 and
<>Bha1rgavi1.
<HI>DEVI1. (Maha1ma1ya1). Though Devi1 is without a beginn-
<>ing it is told how she became first visible to living beings.
<NI>1) {%Beginning:%} While Maha1vis2n2u was resting on a fig
<>leaf in the assumed form of a child he began thinking
<>as to who he was, who created him and how he should
<>act. And then a celestial voice announced as follows:
<NI>Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham
<NI>Na1nyadasti sana1tanam.
<NI>(All that is, I am. There is nothing eternal but me.).
<>This declaration astonished Vis2n2u, but he could not
<>understand who made it. While he was meditating
<>upon it, Devi1 appeared to him in the following manner.
<>Devi1

<>of shame), Jr2mbha1 and Tandra1 (laziness).
<NI>And, the Devi1 spoke to Maha1vis2n2u as follows:--After
<>all, what is there to be wondered at. Whenever the
<>world faced the phenomenon of Sr2s2t2isthitilaya (crea-
<>tion, existence and absorption into the primordial force)
<>you too have come up due to the power of Maha1s4akti.
<>As for Para1s4akti (the ultimate, universal force) it is
<>above and beyond all attributes. We, all of us, possess
<>attributes. From the na1bhi (navel) of yourself in whom
<>sattvagun2a (gentle attributes) predominates will be
<>born Brahma1 in whom rajogun2a (active attributes)
<>will predominate, and from the centre of his brows
<>will be born Rudra with tamogun2a (black, destructive
<>attributes). Brahma1, by the force of his tapas will earn
<>powers of creation and will with his rajogun2a create
<>the world blood-red in colour, and you will be the
<>sustainer and guardian of that world. The very same
<>world will be annihilated by Rudra at the end of the
<>Kalpa era. You please do know that I am the sa1ttvic
<>force which depend on you for the purpose of creation.
<>All creations of worlds have been made according to
<>the suggestions of Devi1.
<NI>2) {%Origin of Devi1.%} Once King Janamejaya questioned
<>Vya1sa about the birth of Devi1 to which he replied as
<>follows:--
<NI>Even Brahma1vis2n2umahes4varas (Brahma1, Vis2n2u and
<>S4iva--the Hindu trinity) are not capable of thinking
<>about the origin of Devi1. Then, what about me? Yet
<>let me make an attempt. All the forces--everything--
<>which appear in various names and forms are in fact
<>Devi1 herself, her different manifestations. Just as a
<>master actor appears on the stage in different roles for
<>the delectation of the audience the formless Devi1, on
<>behalf of the Devas, assumes many forms and imposes
<>upon herself attributes though in fact she is without any
<>attribute whatsoever. Thus, depending on her various
<>forms, actions etc. she is addressed by different names.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Five forms of Devi1.%} When primordial nature (Mu1la-
<>prakr2ti) incarnated or manifested in the form of Vis2n2u
<>the desire for creation raised its head in him. And, at
<>once the Devi1--female--aspects in Vis2n2u manifested
<>in five forms like Durga1, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1, Sa1vitri1 and
<>Ra1dha1. These five forms are designated as the
<>Pan5cadevi1s. Brief notes on the five Devi1s are given
<>below.
<NI>(1) {%Durga1devi1.%} Mother of Gan2es4a bhagava1n. (God with
<>the elephant's head). She is the consort of S4iva.
<>Na1ra1yan2i1, the Vis2n2uma1ya1, is none else than Durga1.
<>She is also perfect Brahma, the one and the only one
<>with no second to it. She is worshipped by Devas like
<>Brahma1 and by sages and mahars2is. She is the basis,
<>the root and root cause of everything. She is eternal,
<>upholder of dharma, truth itself and the giver and
<>promoter of happiness, reputation, welfare, salvation
<>etc. as also of sorrow, grief, pain etc. She takes great [Page217-a+ 64]
<>preasure in removing the worries and sorrows of devo-
<>tees who seek refuge in her. She is all-power, achieve-
<>ments and assets personified. All imaginable permuta-
<>tions and combinations of every attribute comprise in
<>her and she it is who activates the universal soul.
<NI>2) {%Laks2mi1.%} This Devi1 is the most sublime form of the
<>universal soul, nay, the universal soul itself. She is all
<>wealth and riches personified, and she is the very seat of
<>beauty, compassion, welfare, peace, all goodness etc.
<>Evil traits like anger, avarice, haughtiness etc. are miles
<>away from her. She is all sympathy and kindness
<>towards her devotees. In Vaikun2t2ha, as Maha1laks2mi1 she
<>is ever engaged in the service of her husband, Vis2n2u.
<>In heaven she is the very glory of it. In houses she
<>appears as the welfare and prosperity of the inmates.
<>She is in fact beauty itself and is the essence of beauty
<>everywhere. She is all-merciful, and worshipped by
<>all.
<NI>(3) {%Sarasvati1.%} She is very base and fountain head of and
<>the presiding deity of the word, intellect, knowledge,
<>the arts etc. She also is of the form of the universal
<>soul and liberally grants intellect, poetical skill, reason
<>and logic, understanding capacity etc. to her devotees.
<>The finest music with all its beauties originates from
<>her. Yes, she is the goddess of all learning, fine arts and
<>every branch of knowledge. Like the ice piece, the
<>Jasmine flower etc. she is beautiful in her white cover.
<>She recited the holy names of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. She is of the
<>form of tapas and blesses those who perform it. In fact,
<>she it is who grants all gifts and powers of understand-
<>ing. She is the goddess of language and learning (Va1n2i1-
<>ma1ta1) and without her human beings would lose their
<>capacity to speak.
<NI>(4) {%Sa1vitri1devi1.%} She is mother of the four varn2as (castes,
<>classes) Veda1n3gas, the ta1ntric science etc. She is of
<>the form of Japa (chanting of holy names and mantras),
<>tapas, the effulgence of Brahman, the very essence of
<>truth and existence and supreme bliss. She is eternal
<>and grants salvation. She forms the very basis and pith
<>and core of the glowing presence of the universal soul.
<>This world is pure, and has been purified by the touch
<>of the sacred feet of this Devi1.
<NI>(5) {%Ra1dha1devi1.%} Ra1dhika1devi1, fifth of the pan5caprakr2tis is
<>the presiding deity over the five pra1n2as and She is of
<>the form of those pra1n2as. She is exceptionally beautiful
<>endowed with all fortunes and happiness, sublime and
<>serious, and the consort of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and as eternal
<>and equally endowed with divine attributes as the lord.
<>She is formless also, above and beyond attributes,
<>unattached and detached, and not visible even to the
<>great Devas and munis by the naked eye. Her clothes
<>even Agni would not burn. She was born, in Va1ra1ha
<>Kalpa as the daughter of Vr2s2abha1nu, and because her
<>sacred feet trod over this land, Bha1rata (India) became
<>holy. Once Brahma1 did tapas for 60,000 years to have
<>a glimpse of the Devi1's lotus feet, but could not. People
<>were able to see her only after she, in unbounded com-
<>passion for the world, incarnated herself in Vr2nda1vana
<>(See Prakr2ti).
<NI>4) {%Am3s4aru1pa(s)--partial manifestations of Devi1.%} The
<>above discussion was concerned with the five forms of the
<>Devi1 in her full and complete forms. Now, there are
<>six other Devi1s, who are partial manifestations or born
<>from certain parts of the Devi1. [Page217-b+ 64]
<NI>(1) {%Gan3ga1devi1.%} This Devi1 who flows in the form of
<>water and washes off men's sins takes her origin from
<>the body of Maha1vis2n2u. (There is another story which
<>traces Gan3ga1's origin to the An2d2a (egg or seed) of
<>Brahma1). (See Gan3ga1).
<NI>(2) {%Tulasi1.%} She is the lover and also the servant at
<>the feet of Vis2n2u. She also washes off men's sins and
<>promotes their welfare. (See Tulasi1).
<NI>(3) {%Manasa1devi1%} Manasa1devi1, who was born as a dau-
<>ghter of Kas4yapa is another partial incarnation of
<>Maha1ma1ya1. She is a great tapasvini1, a favourite dis-
<>ciple of S4an3kara, unique in learning and erudition,
<>sister of Ananta (the king of Serpents), the presiding
<>deity of Mantras, wife of Jaratka1ru muni and mother
<>of A1sti1ka muni. (See Manasa1devi1).
<NI>(4) {%Devasena1devi1.%} Since this Devi1 has been born out of a
<>sixth part of Maha1ma1ya1 she is called S2as2t2hi1devi1 also. It
<>is this Devi1, who gives children to living beings and also
<>protects them. For one year from the birth of a child
<>this Devi1 should be worshipped. Those who cannot
<>afford it should worship Devi1 on the 6th or 21st day
<>after a child is born. (See Devasena1).
<NI>(5) {%Man3galacan2d2ika1.%} She is born from the face of
<>Mu1laprakr2ti. Anybody who propitiates and pleases
<>her will be the recipient of all good things like sons and
<>grandsons, wealth, reputation, welfare etc. (See Man3-
<>galacan2d2ika1).
<NI>(6) {%Bhu1midevi1.%} She is the basis for all things, soil for
<>the origin of the vegetable kingdom, the treasure
<>house of all gems and the very incarnation of compas-
<>sion and sympathy. (See Bhu1midevi1).
<NI>5) {%Am3s4akala1devi1(s).%} Another class of devi1s who are
<>also partial manifestations of the Supreme Devi1. They
<>are born out of the parts of Maha1devi1. The following
<>are the Am3s4akala1devi1s.
<NI>(1) {%Sva1ha1devi1.%} Consort of Agni Bhagava1n (Fire God).
<>Sva1ha1 is worshipped in all the worlds. If havis (obla-
<>tion) is offered without repeating her name the Devas
<>will not accept it.
<NI>(2) {%Daks2in2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is wor-
<>shipped by all. Without this Devi1 all Karmans (actions)
<>in the world will become futile.
<NI>(3) {%Di1ks2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is worshipp-
<>ed by all.
<Poem>Di1yate vimalam3 jn5a1nam
<>Ks2i1yate karmava1sana1 /
<>Tena di1ks2eti sa1 prokta1.</Poem>
<>The Devi1 grants pure knowledge.
<NI>(4) {%Svadha1devi1.%} Wife of the Pitr2s, worshipped by manes
<>and men. Offerings made to the Pitr2s without honour-
<>ing this Devi1 will prove to be futile.
<NI>(5) {%Svastidevi1.%} Consort of the Va1yu. When offering Daks2in2a1
<>and making divya-da1na (divine gifts) if ‘Svasti’ (may
<>good happen) is not uttered the gifts will be of no use.
<NI>(6) {%Pus2t2idevi1.%} Wife of Gan2apati. If this Devi1 ceased to
<>exist men and women would become feeble, because
<>she is the source of all strength.
<NI>(7) {%Tus2t2idevi1.%} Consort of Ananta worshipped by every-
<>body. If the Devi1 ceased to exist there would be no
<>happiness in the world.
<NI>(8) {%Sampatti devi1.%} Wife of I1s4a1na. Worshipped by Devas
<>and men. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become poor and indigent.
<NI>(9) {%Dhr2ti.%} Consort of Kapila. Everybody worships her [Page218-a+ 64]
<>all the time. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become timid and cowardly.
<NI>(10) {%Sati1devi1.%} Wife of Satya. Well-wisher of all, this
<>Devi1 is worshipped by muktas. (people released from
<>worldly attachments). If the Devi1 ceased to exist there
<>would be no friendship and amity between people.
<NI>(11) {%Daya1devi1.%} Wife of Moha. If the Devi1 ceased to
<>exist the world would become hellish and a fierce battle
<>field.
<NI>(12) {%Pratis2t2ha1devi1.%} Wife of Pun2ya. In the absence of
<>this Devi1, who grants good and happy results to people's
<>actions the whole world would become as though it
<>were dead.
<NI>(13) {%Siddhadevi1.%}
<NI>(14) {%Ki1rtidevi1.%} Both the Devi1s, Siddha1 and Ki1rti are
<>wives of Sukarma1. If they ceased to exist the whole
<>world would be bereft of reputation and become lifeless
<>like a dead body.
<NI>(15) {%Kriya1devi1.%} Wife of Udyoga. If she ceased to exist
<>the whole world would become inactive and cease to
<>function.
<NI>(16) {%Mithya1d2evi1.%} Wife of Adharma. Wayward and
<>characterless people worship this Devi1. If the Devi1
<>ceased to exist the whole world as evolved by Brahma1
<>would cease to exist. This Devi1 was not seen anywhere
<>in the world during Kr2tayuga. She began to appear
<>in a subtle form here and there during Treta1yuga. In
<>dva1parayuga she attained more growth and then her
<>limbs and organs became doubly strong. In Kaliyuga
<>she developed to her full stature and growth and goes
<>about everywhere with her brother, Cheat (Kapat2a).
<NI>(17) {%S4a1ntidevi1.%} (see below).
<NI>(18) {%Lajja1devi1.%} Both the Devi1s, S4a1nti and Lajja1 are good-
<>natured wives. If they ceased to exist the world would
<>become dull and sleepy.
<NI>(19-20-21) {%Buddhidevi1, Medha1devi1%} and {%Dhr2tidevi1.%} These
<>three Devi1s are wives of Jn5a1na. If they ceased to exist
<>the world would become steeped in ignorance and
<>foolishness.
<NI>(22) {%Mu1rti.%} Wife of Dharma. She is very beautiful and
<>effulgent. In her absence the universal soul would be-
<>come devoid of vitality, helpless and meaningless.
<NI>(23) {%S4ri1devi1.%} Wife of Ma1li1. Her absence will make the
<>world lifeless.
<NI>(24) {%Nidra1devi1.%} Wife of Ka1la1gni. The Devi1, a sage
<>who has attained realisation, affects everybody in the
<>world during night and makes them lose consciousness
<>and plunges them in sleep. In the absence of this Devi1
<>the world will become a lunatic asylum.
<NI>(25-26-27) {%Ra1tri1, Sandhya1%} and {%Divasa1.%} These three are the
<>wives of Time (Ka1la). In their absence nobody would
<>have any sense of time and none would be able to cal-
<>culate and fix time.
<NI>(28-29) {%Vis4appu%} and {%Da1ham.%} Vis4appu = hunger.
<>Da1ham = thirst. These two Devi1s are the wives of
<>greed (Lobha). They go about the world affecting
<>people and thus making them worried and miserable.
<NI>(30-31) {%Prabha1devi1%} and {%Da1hika1 devi1%} are the wives of
<>Tejas (Vitality). Without them I1s4vara will find it im-
<>possible to continue the function of creation.
<NI>(32-33) {%Mr2tyu%} and {%Jara1%} are the consorts of Prakr2s2t2a-
<>jvara and daughters of Ka1la. And, if they cease to exist,
<>Brahma1's creation would also cease. (For Brahma1's
<>creation individual souls with the will for action are [Page218-b+ 65]
<>necessary. He cannot create a soul of his own. So
<>death is a pre-condition of creation, birth. If there is
<>no death there is no birth also. There is a school of
<>thought which maintains that if there is no death but
<>only birth there will not be space on earth for the living,
<>and therefore birth will stop if there is no death.).
<NI>(34-35) {%Tandra1%} and {%Pri1ti%} are the daughters of Nidra1 and
<>consorts of Sukha (pleasure, happiness). These Devi1s go
<>around the world on the orders of Brahma1.
<NI>(36-37) {%S4raddha1%} and {%Bhakti%} are the consorts of Vaira1gya
<>(aversion to wordly comforts, renunciation) and they
<>give salvation to the souls of the people in the world.
<NI>Aditi, mother of the Devas, Diti, mother of the Asuras,
<>Surabhi, mother of cows, Kadru1, mother of serpents
<>and Vinata1, mother of Garud2as are also involved in the
<>process of creation, and they are born out of parts of
<>Devi1.
<NI>6) {%Idol of Devi1.%} There are special injunctions for mak-
<>ing idols of the Devi1 for installation in temples. Can2d2i-
<>ka1devi1 should have twenty hands. The hands on the
<>right side should hold S4u1la, sword, disc, cord,
<>d2amaru, s4akti etc. and the hands on the left side should
<>hold na1gapa1s4a, flag, club, mirror etc. (There are also
<>idols with slight differences from the above).
<NI>Laks2mi1devi1 would hold in her right hand the lotus
<>flower and a Ku1vala fruit in the left. Sarasvati1devi1 will
<>have in her hands books, aks2ama1la1 and vi1n2a1. Gan3ga1devi1
<>rides on a makaramatsya (fish) holding in her hands
<>a pot and lotus flowers. Yamuna1devi1 rides the turtle
<>with a pot in hand and she is blue in colour.
<NI>Now, about the saptama1tr2s. Tumburu, white in colour,
<>and mounted on an ox rests on a s4u1la with vi1n2a1 in hand
<>before the Ma1tr2s. Among the Ma1tr2s Bra1hmi1 has four
<>faces, wears the aks2ama1la1 and holds the aks2apa1tra etc.
<>in her left hand. She is seated on a swan. S4a1n3kari1
<>(Ma1hes4vari1) is white in colour. She has in her right
<>hand bow and arrows, and the disc and bow in her left
<>hand. The ox is her vehicle. Kauma1ri1 is seated on the
<>peacock. She has two hands in one of which is held
<>S4akti (Vel). Laks2mi1 has in her right hand the conch
<>and disc, and the club and the lotus flower in her left
<>hand. Va1ra1hi1 rides the buffalo with staff, sword, club
<>and conch in her hands. Indra1n2i1 is seated on the club,
<>holding diamond in her hands. She has a thousand
<>eyes. Ca1mun2d2i1 has three eyes and is without flesh in the
<>body. Her hairs are raised above. She holds in her left
<>hand elephant's skin and s4u1la in the right hand. At
<>times she is seated on a corpse also.
<NI>Now, about the idols of the eight Am3ba1s. Rudra Carc-
<>cika1 holds a skull, S4u1la and cord in her hands. She
<>wears elephant's skin, her legs slightly held up. She
<>becomes Rudraca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes eight hands,
<>and holds the skull and the d2amaru. And in dancing
<>pose she is called Nat2es4vari1, and with four faces Maha1l-
<>aks2mi1. She is called Siddhaca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes
<>the form with ten hands and three eyes, and when she
<>eats men, horses and buffaloes. In this form she holds
<>in her right hand the sword, d2amaru etc. and in her
<>left hand the Tris4u1la, bell etc. Since the Devi1 is sarva-
<>siddhiprada1yika1 (giver of all divine attainments or
<>assets) she is Siddhayoges4vari1 also. There is also an-
<>other Devi1 in this very form who holds the pa1s4a and
<>Am3kus4a in her hand and who is slightly red in colour.
<>She is called Bhairavi1. When Bhairavi1 assumes the
<>form with twelve hands she is called Ru1pavidya1. All the [Page219-a+ 64]
<>above eight Devi1s were born in burial grounds and are
<>Raudramu1rtis. They are known as the As2t2a1mba1s.
<HI>DEVI1BHA1GAVATA. The S4aivas venerate this book as
<>one of the eighteen Pura1n2as. But according to the Vai-
<>s2n2avites, this is an authoritative book of a loftier level
<>than the eighteen Pura1n2as. (See under Pura1n2a).
<HI>DEVIKA1 I. (VEDIKA1). Daughter of Gova1sa, the S4ai-
<>bya King. She was wedded by Yudhis2t2hira in Svayam3-
<>vara, and to them were born a son called Yaudheya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 76).
<HI>DEVIKA1 II. A holy centre. A dip in the ti1rtha there
<>will give the same result as that of a yajn5a. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 102).
<HI>DEVI1PI1T2HA. The dead body of Sati1devi1 crumbled into
<>small pieces and fell in different places in Bha1rata.
<>Each place where a piece of the dead body fell, is known
<>by the name Devi1pi1t2ha. There is a reason why the
<>dead body crumbled into pieces.
<NI>Daks2a performed a sacrifice to which S4iva was not invit-
<>ed and Sati1devi1 came to the sacrifice, and committed
<>suicide by jumping into the fire. S4iva who became furi-
<>ous, killed Daks2a and carrying the dead body of his
<>wife on his shoulder, walked the length and breadth of
<>Bha1rata like a mad man. It seemed that he was not
<>going to recover from this mania, and the devas (gods)
<>were worried at this. To rescue S4iva from this mental
<>disposition, Maha1vis2n2u, unseen by others, followed
<>S4iva with a bow and arrow. Whenever it was conve-
<>nient Maha1vis2n2u sent an arrow at the body of Sati1devi1,
<>on the shoulder of S4iva. By the hitting of the arrows
<>the body was crumbled into pieces and fell here and
<>there. Thus within a few days the body of Sati1devi1
<>came to an end and S4iva walked to Kaila1sa. The
<>pieces of the dead body fell in 108 places, and thus 108
<>Devi1pi1t2has came into existence. The names of the
<>places and the names by which the Devi1 is known in
<>such places are given below.

<HI>DEVI1STHA1NA. A holy place, dedicated to S4a1kam3bhari1
<>Devi1. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Vana Parva, Chapter
<>84, Stanza 13) that one who stays in this holy place
<>and eats greens (cira or kira) for three days will get
<>the fruits of eating greens for twelve years.
<HI>DEVI1TI1RTHA(M). The common name of three holy
<>centres (S4an3khini1, Madhuvat2i1, Mr2gadhu1ma1) in Kuruk-
<>s2etra. Those who bathe in S4ankhini1 will become beauti-
<>ful in appearance, while those who bathe in Madhu-
<>vat2i1 and Mr2gadhu1ma1 will get the benefits of perform-
<>ing a thousand goda1nas (gifts of cows).
<HI>DHA. This letter means dha1ran2a, S4obhana, Dha1ta1, dhat-
<>tu1ra (umma plant). (Chapter 348, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHA1MA1. A hermit who protected Gan3ga1-Maha1dva1ra.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 111, Stanza
<>17).
<HI>DHAMADHAMA. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>27, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAKA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHANAPA1LA. A Vais4ya who lived in the city of Ayo-
<>dhya1. He built in Ayodhya1 a temple for the Sun-god
<>and appointed, for a year, paying his wages in advance,
<>a scholar well versed in Pura1n2as to read aloud the
<>Pura1n2as in the temple. After six months Dhanapa1la
<>died and as a result of the goodness accrued to him by
<>his worthy deeds the Sun-god came to him with his
<>chariot and took him to his place and seating him on
<>his seat paid respects to him. Later he was taken to
<>Brahmaloka. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Brahma Ka1n2d2a,
<>Chapter 94).
<HI>DHANAS4ARMA1. A brahmin belonging to Madhyades4a.
<>Once when Dhanas4arma1 went to the forest to get
<>darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and gett-
<>ing frightened ran away from them. But the spirits
<>followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said
<>“Oh, please do not harm me. Maha1vis2n2u will bless
<>you.”
<NI>The moment they heard the name of Vis2n2u there came
<>a change in them. They reiterated their story to
<>Dhanas4arma1. Their names were Vais4a1kha, Suda1sa and
<>Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vais4a1kha he
<>got a nick-name ‘Kr2taghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All
<>the three were human beings in their previous birth.
<>Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivi1ra.
<>All the three became evil spirits because of their sins.
<NI>From the conversation Dhanas4arma1 understood that
<>Vais4a1kha was his father and they then knew each other. [Page220-b+ 64]
<>The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to
<>absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell.
<>Vais4a1kha then told him observe the vrata, Vais4a1kha-
<>pu1rn2ima1. He did that and all the spirits went to
<>heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAVARDHANA. A virtuous Vais4ya who lived in
<>the island of Pus2kara in the Kr2tayuga. Once Dhana-
<>vardhana after having performed Vais4vadeva sat for
<>his food. At that time he heard a cry from outside
<>“Annam3 dehi (give me food)”. Dhanavardhana imme-
<>diately came out to see who the visitor was but seeing
<>none went in and started taking his food. Because he
<>ate his food once left aside, his body was torn to
<>hundred pieces. (Bhavis2ya, Brahma Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANAVATI1. See Su1ryaprabha1.
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA I. A famous serpent. This serpent was
<>born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife Kadru1. (S4loka 5,
<>Chapter 35, A1di Parva). This serpent served as a rope to
<>bind the horses to the chariot of S4iva during the time
<>of burning to death the Tripuras. (S4loka 29, Chapter
<>34, Karn2a Parva). This serpent sits in the court of
<>Varun2a and worships him. (S4loka 9, Chapter 9,
<>Sabha1 parva).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA II. Another name for Arjuna. (See under
<>Arjuna).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA III. The army given to Subrahman2ya by
<>S4iva. (S4loka 17, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA IV. A Sanskrit critic who lived during
<>the period between 11th and 12th century A.D. He was
<>a member of the court of King Mun5ja. His important
<>work is ‘Das4aru1paka’. This work contains three
<>hundred s4lokas divided in four separate divisions. After
<>the death of Mun5ja, Dhanika, brother of Dhanan5jaya,
<>wrote a commentary on this work. The treatise is
<>named ‘Das4aru1pa1valoka’. There are several quotations in
<>this from the Sanskrit dramas ‘Ven2i1sam3ha1ra’ and ‘Ratna1-
<>vali1’. He has in this work discussed Drama and Poetry
<>in general giving prominence to the emotional side of it.
<>The critical work, Das4aru1pa1valoka, contains quotations
<>from a book ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ by Dhanika himself. But
<>the work ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ has not yet been made avail-
<>able. Even in composing poetry Dhanan5jaya was well
<>versed. He is the author of the well-known epic ‘Ra1ghava-
<>pa1n2d2avi1ya’. It is known as ‘Dvisandha1na Ka1vya’ also.
<>This is based on the lives of Pa1n2d2avas and S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<NI>Dhanan5jaya bears the name of S4rutaki1rti also. It is
<>stated by scholars that Ra1ghavapa1n2d2avi1ya was written
<>during the period 1123 to 1140 A.D. (History of classi-
<>cal Sanskrit Literature).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA V. There was once a brahmin ascetic
<>called Dhanan5jaya in the gotra of Vasis2t2ha. This hermit
<>had hundred wives and got hundred sons, one by each
<>of his wives. The son born of his wife S4a1bha1ka (S4ala1ka)
<>was named Karun2a. The father divided his assets
<>equally among his sons and yet they quarrelled with
<>each other.
<NI>Once Karun2amuni went to the shores of Bhava-
<>na1s4ini1 along with a few other munis to worship
<>Narasim3ha. There a brahmin had brought a lovely
<>lime as an offering to the deity. Karun2a took the lime
<>from him and smelt it. At this the brahmin got angry
<>and cursed him. “Sinner, may you live as a fly for a
<>hundred years. Then Maha1tma1 Dadhi1ca will give you
<>back your original form.” Karun2a instantly became a [Page221-a+ 65]
<>fly and he pleaded to his wife thus “Beloved, I have
<>become a fly. Please do protect me.” Karun2a started
<>flying hither and thither and his cruel brothers made
<>the fly fall in oil and killed it. S4ucismita1, wife of
<>Karun2a, started weeping laying the dead fly in her lap.
<>Arundhati1devi1 passing that way saw her and consoled
<>her thus: ‘S4ucismita1, stop lamenting. I shall bring it
<>to life this instant by sacred ashes.’ So saying the Devi1
<>took some ashes from the fire-pit and reciting the
<>powerful Mr2tyun5jaya mantra sprinkled it on the dead
<>body of the fly. S4ucismita1 fanned the fly. The potency
<>of the ashes brought the fly back to life.
<NI>After a hundred years one of his relatives killed it
<>again. S4ucismita1 grief-stricken, took the dead fly to the
<>Mahars2i, Dadhi1ca. The sage told her thus: “It was
<>bhasma (sacred ashes) that gave life three times to
<>Jamadagni, Kas4yapa, the devas and myself. I will,
<>therefore, give life to thy husband by bhasma itself.”
<>Dadhi1ca took some ashes and meditating on Mahes4vara
<>recited a mantra and sprinkled it on the dead fly and
<>brought it back to life. By the touch of Dadhi1ca, the
<>fly, husband of S4ucismita1, became Karun2a again and
<>both of them went back to their hermitage. (Chapter
<>101, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA VI. A brahmin devotee of Maha1vis2n2u
<>who lived in the Treta1 yuga. Once, in winter, when
<>for want of proper clothing he could bear the biting
<>cold no longer, he broke some twigs of the As4vattha
<>tree (poplar leafed fig tree) and made fire to warm
<>him. When Dhanan5jaya broke the twigs it gave reflec-
<>tive pain on the body of Maha1vis2n2u. But Maha1vis2n2u
<>who was aware of the unflinching devotion of Dhanan5-
<>jaya to himself was not displeased but appeared before
<>Dhanan5jaya with wounds all over the body. The
<>Brahmin enquired how Vis2n2u got the wounds and on
<>knowing that it was the consequence of his breaking the
<>twigs of As4vattha Dhanan5jaya in utter grief started to
<>cut his own head off. Greatly pleased Vis2n2u stopped
<>him from his attempt and asked him to name a boon.
<>Very modestly he replied that he would be satisfied if
<>he was given the strength to continue as a devotee of
<>Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANES4VARA. A Brahmin born in the city of Avanti.
<>Abandoning the duties enjoined by scriptures to a
<>Brahmin he strayed away from the Brahmin fold doing
<>all sorts of sins. He became a store-house of sins. He
<>was engaged in commerce and once while travelling he
<>reached the city of Ma1his2mati1. There he met many people
<>from several adjoining villages who had come there to ob-
<>serve the Ka1rttika Vrata. Later Dhanes4vara was bitten by
<>a cobra there and fell down fainting. Very soon he died.
<NI>When he died the messengers of Yama came
<>and took him bound to Ka1lapuri1. There, Citra-
<>gupta read out to Yama all the sins Dhanes4vara had
<>committed from boyhood till his death. Citragupta
<>added “Even from boyhood there is no record of any
<>good deed done by him. On the other hand the sins he
<>has committed could not be told in a year. He is an
<>incarnation of evil. He must be roasted in hell till the
<>end of the world.” On hearing this the body of Yama
<>blazed like flame with anger and calling aside an atten-
<>dant he ordered, “Hi, Pretapa1laka, take this sinner
<>away, beat him with spiked clubs and throw him into
<>Kumbhi1pa1ka”. Pretapa1laka instantly took him away
<>and breaking his head with a thorn-spiked club threw [Page221-b+ 64]
<>him into a copper vessel containing burning oil. But to
<>his great amazement the burning oil became cold as
<>soon as the body of Dhanes4vara came into contact with
<>it just as it happened once before in the case of Prahla1da.
<>The perplexed attendant ran to Yama and told him of
<>this strange incident. Yama was also surprised at this
<>novelty in hell and called back Dhanes4vara and started
<>enquiring about his life once again. Na1rada came there
<>at that time. Both of them then talked about Dhanes4vara.
<>Na1rada told Yama how the unanticipated thing so
<>happened because Dhanes4vara on the eve of his death
<>spent some time with people who were observing the
<>Ka1rttika Vrata washing away thus all the sins accumu-
<>lated so far in his life. Hearing that Yama took Dhanes4-
<>vara round hell and giving Dhanes4vara, the position of
<>a Yaks2a sent him to Kuberapuri1. (Chapter 115, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANI. A messenger of the asuras called Kapas. The
<>Kapas once sent Dhani to preach moral code among the
<>Brahmins. (Chapter 157, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.)
<HI>DHANIKA. A Sanskrit poet. (See Dhanan5jaya IV).
<HI>DHANUGR2HA. (DHANUGRAHA, DHANURDHARA)
<>One of the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed
<>in the great battle by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 62, Chapter 84,
<>Karn2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANUVAKTRA. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>62, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANURVEDA.
<NI>{%General information.%} A scientific treatise on the art of
<>warfare in ancient Bha1rata. Because of the undue im-
<>portance of the science the treatise is deemed and respect-
<>ed as a Veda. There have been innumerable books on the
<>subject to teach Dhanurveda to the Ks2atriya youths.
<>In the book ‘Prastha1nabheda’ by Madhusu1dana Saras-
<>vati1 he states that Dhanurveda is a branch of Yajurveda.
<>A Sanskrit book called Dhanurvedasam3hita1 is now
<>available. Some scholars are of opinion that not much
<>antiquity can be attributed to this work. Many books
<>relating to Dhanurveda have been lost to us. What
<>details are there in Agni Pura1n2a are given below:
<NI>2) {%Divisions of Dhanurveda.%} This is known as Catus2pa1da
<>(four-footed) also because of the fact that the four
<>main constituents of an army are the chariots, elephants,
<>horses and men. Dhanurveda has been divided into
<>five parts (1) Yantramukta, (2) Pa1n2imukta, (3) Mukta-
<>sandha1rita, (4) Amukta and (5) Ba1huyuddha. There is
<>another division according to Astra and S4astra. There
<>is yet another division of the science into two by some
<>scholars from a different viewpoint calling them Ma1ya1
<>and R2ju.
<NI>{%Yantramukta%} (Yantra = machine). This means a war-
<>fare where machines are used. Ks2epin2i1 (sling) bow and
<>arrow and other such machines are included in this.
<NI>{%Pa1n2imukta.%} (Pa1n2i = hand). This is where the hand is used
<>mainly. Stone, mace etc. are used in this.
<NI>{%Muktasandha1rita.%} This includes the use of weapons like
<>a spear.
<NI>{%Amukta.%} The use of a weapon like a sword which never
<>leaves your hand.
<NI>{%Ba1huyuddha.%} (Ba1hu = head). The fight with only bare
<>hands without the use of a weapon. One who wishes
<>to fight should make ready his own weapons. He should
<>be one who will never get tired even after exertion. A
<>war with bows and arrows is considered the best and [Page222-a+ 65]
<>most manly, that with a spear ranks next, a fight with a
<>sword is bad and a fight with hands, the most mean.
<NI>3) {%The Trainees.%} Only a brahmin is entitled to be a pre-
<>ceptor in Dhanurveda. The Ks2atriya and Vais4ya should
<>learn from him. The S4u1dra can fight of his own in
<>danger. He is not allowed to learn military science
<>from a preceptor. Those mixed-born are to help the
<>king during a war.
<NI>4) {%Various postures.%} There are nine different ways of
<>standing when you give a fight, classified according to
<>the different positions of one's foot, heel and knee.
<NI>{%Samapa1da.%} When you stand with your An3gus2t2ha, Nari-
<>ya1n2i (Gulpha), Pa1n2i and Pa1da closely joined together,
<>it is termed Samapa1da.
<NI>{%Vais4a1kha.%} Keep your legs twentyseven inches apart and
<>without bending your knees stand erect throwing your
<>weight on the fingers of the foot. This stand is called
<>Vais4a1kha.
<NI>{%Man2d2ala.%} Keep your knees thirtysix inches apart and
<>stand in the shape of a ham3sapan3kti and this position
<>is called Man2d2ala.
<NI>{%A1li1d2ha.%} Bend your right knee and thigh in the shape of a
<>plough and without any movement to that posture
<>draw your left leg fortyfive inches apart. This stand is
<>called A1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Pratya1li1d2ha.%} If you bend your left knee and thigh and
<>stand like above it is called Pratya1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Ja1ta.%} Place your right foot straight and place the left one
<>perpendicular to the right one with the heels and the
<>ankles of the feet five fingers apart. The whole length
<>of the posture should not exceed twelve fingers. This
<>stand is called Ja1ta.
<NI>{%Dan2d2aya1ta.%} Keep the right knee bent and the left leg
<>straight or vice versa. This posture is called Dan2d2a1yata.
<NI>{%Vikat2a.%} If for the above posture the distance between
<>the two legs is two palm-length it is Vikat2a.
<NI>{%Svaput2a.%} Keep the knees vigun2as and the feet Utta1yanas
<>for the posture of Svaput2a.
<NI>{%S4vastika.%} Keep your legs sixteen fingers apart and raise
<>your feet a little keeping the level of both the feet equal.
<>This is Svastika.
<NI>5) {%Use of arrows.%} Before a man is to make use of a bow
<>and arrow he should first take the posture of Svastika
<>and bow down. He should take the bow by the left hand,
<>take the arrow by the right hand. He then should adopt
<>a posture of either Vais4a1kha or Ja1ta and taking the bow
<>should sink into the earth one end of the bow and
<>draw the bow-string up to the other end and see whe-
<>ther there is sufficient length for the string. He should
<>take an arrow from his sheath and thrust the arrow-
<>head into the ground near the bow. He should
<>place his elbow on the top of the arrow with his forearm
<>bent and fist clenched. If the clenched fist touches the
<>top of the bow that bow and arrow is superior to any
<>other. He should tie the bow-string in a way that the
<>distance between the tied bow-string and the bow is
<>twelve fingers. He should place the bow in front of his
<>navel and the arrows in a quiver on his hip. Taking an
<>arrow he should raise the bow and fix the arrow at a
<>point on the bow-tring between his eye and ear. He
<>should take the arrow by his left fist and fix it so that the
<>fist touches the left nipple. The bow should not change
<>position horizontally, vertically, laterally, face down-
<>wards or upwards. Then taking an arrow from the sheath
<>by the thumb and forefinger fix it on the bow-string and [Page222-b+ 65]
<>stretch it well before sending the shot. The clue to
<>correct aim is this. Anything that one can see with one's
<>eyes but can be covered by his fist is within the arrow-
<>shot. When one arrow is sent another should be taken
<>immediately from the sheath and sent in quick succes-
<>sion. This is called Upaccheda.
<NI>6) {%Operations with a sword and a carma (shield).%} There
<>are thirtytwo different ways of putting into use a sword
<>or a ‘carma’ (shield). Bhra1nta, Udbhra1nta, A1viddha,

<NI>9) {%Dhanurveda in Maha1bha1rata.%} Some references to Dhanur-
<>veda in Maha1ha1rata are given below:
<NI>(1) A sage named S4aradva1n was a noted preceptor in
<>Dhanurveda. Kr2pa1ca1rya learnt Dhanurveda from him
<>and taught many others of his disciples. (Chapter 129,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(2) Dron2a1ca1rya learnt Dhanurveda from Paras4ura1ma [Page223-a+ 65]
<>and imparted it to many other disciples of his including
<>the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas. (Chapter 129, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(3) Agnives4a, a sage, learnt Dhanurveda from sage
<>Agastya. (S4loka 9, Chapter 133, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(4) Dhanurveda has got ten an3gas and four caran2as.
<>(Chapters 6 and 41, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(5) Four-footed Dhanurveda worshipped Subrahman2ya.
<>(S4loka 22, Chapter 44, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANUS2A. An ancient sage. He was a priest in the ya1ga
<>of Uparicaravasu. (S4loka 7, Chapter 336, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>DHANUS2A1KS2A. An ancient sage. He killed Medha1vi1,
<>son of the sage Ba1ladhi, accusing Medha1vi of having
<>mocked other sages (S4loka 50, Chapter 135, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>DHANVA. One of the Kings of Ka1s4i. Dhanvantari was
<>born as his son. (For details see under Dhanvantari).
<HI>DHANVANTARI I. A deva who was a preceptor in
<>A1yurveda.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} The devas and asuras together churned the
<>milky ocean, Ks2i1ra1bdhi, to salvage Amr2ta (Nectar) from
<>it. After thousand years there arose from the ocean a
<>deva with a Kaman2d2alu (water-pot of ascetics) in one
<>hand and a dan2d2a in the other. That deva was Dhan-
<>vantari, (S4loka 31, Sarga 45, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>The birth of Dhanvantari from the ocean of Milk is
<>described in Chapter 29 of Harivam3s4a thus:
<NI>Prosperous-looking Dhanvantari rising above the water-
<>level of Ks2i1ra1bdhi stood worshipping Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u
<>gave him the name of Abja. Dhanvantari is thus known
<>by the name of Abja also. Dhanvantari bowing to
<>Vis2n2u said “Prabho, I am your son. Allot to me
<>yajn5abha1ga”.
<NI>Vts2n2u replied thus: “Portions of yajn5a have already
<>been allotted. Because you were born after the devas
<>you cannot be considered as one among them. You will
<>be born again in the world for a second time and then you
<>will be a celebrity. In your second life even from while
<>in the womb you will have knowledge of An2ima1 and
<>Garima1. Therefore you will be born as a deva incar-
<>nate. You will write in eight divisions a book on
<>A1yurveda; your second life will be in Dva1para yuga.”
<>After having said so much Vis2n2u disappeared.
<NI>2) {%Rebirth of Dhanvantari.%} Suhotra, King of Ka1s4i, in
<>the second Dva1para yuga had two sons, S4ala and Gr2tsa-
<>mada. S4unaka was the son of Gr2tsamada. S4ala got a son,
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a. Ka1s4a was born to A1rs2t2is2en2a. To Ka1s4a was
<>born Di1rghatapas (Dhanva1). For a long time Dhanva1
<>did not have any children and so he went and did
<>penance to propitiate Abjadeva. Abjadeva (Dhanvan-
<>tari) was pleased and was born as a son to Dhanva1.
<>Dhanva1 named the boy as Dhanvantari and the latter
<>taught his disciples A1yurveda, by parts, eight in num-
<>ber. From Dhanvantari in order were born Ketuma1n--
<>Bhi1maratha--Divoda1sa. (Chapter 29, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>3) {%Dhanvantari and Pariks2it.%} There is a story in the
<>pura1n2as that when Taks2aka went and bit Pari1ks2it to
<>kill him, a Vis2aha1ri (one who cures those infected with
<>snake venom) rushed to save the king but was bribed
<>and sent back by Taks2aka. There are indications in
<>the Pura1n2as to show that the Vis2aha1ri under reference
<>was Dhanvantari though it is stated that Kas4yapa was
<>the person involved. (See under Taks2aka).
<NI>4) {%Dhanvantari and Manasa1devi1.%} In the Kr2s2n2ajanma [Page223-b+ 65]
<>Khan2d2a of Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a there is a story
<>connecting Dhanvantari with Manasa1devi1, a serpent-
<>goddess.
<NI>Once Dhanvantari with his disciples was going to Kaila1sa.
<>On the way Taks2aka made a venom-spitting hiss. At
<>once one of the disciples of Dhanvantari boldly went
<>and plucked the diamond on the head of Taks2aka and
<>threw it to the ground. Hearing this Va1suki, King of
<>serpents, sent to Dhanvantari thousands of serpents
<>under the leadership of Dron2a, Pun2d2ari1ka and Dhanan5-
<>jaya. The poisonous breath of all these serpents joined
<>together made the disciples of Dhanvantari swoon.
<>Immediately Dhanvantari by a medicine made from
<>vanaspati made all his disciples recover and then sent
<>all the serpents to a swoon. When Va1suki heard this
<>he sent the serpent-maid, Manasa1devi1, a disciple of
<>S4iva, to face Dhanvantari. Manasa1devi1 and Gad2u1ra
<>were both disciples of S4iva. But Dhanvantari was a
<>follower of Gad2u1ra. Manasa1devi1 made all the disciples
<>of Dhanvantari swoon but the latter because of his great
<>proficiency is Vis2avidya1 soon brought back his disciples
<>to normal. When Manasa1devi1 found that it was impos-
<>sible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples by using
<>poison Manasa1devi1 took the tris4u1la given to her by S4iva
<>and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this S4iva and
<>Brahma1 appeared before them and pacifying them sent
<>them all their way.
<HI>DHANVANTARI II. (Amr2ta1ca1rya). An eminent medi-
<>cal scientist born in the ambas2t2ha caste. There is no
<>reference anywhere in the Pura1n2as regarding any
<>relationship between the two Dhanvantaris. There is
<>the following story about Amr2ta1ca1rya in Ambas2t2ha1ca1ra-
<>candrika1.
<NI>Once Ga1lava Mahars2i went to the forest to collect
<>darbha and firewood. He walked for long and felt
<>thristy and hungry. Then he saw a girl coming that
<>way with water and Ga1lava quenched his thirst taking
<>water from her. Pleased with her the Mahars2i blessed
<>her saying “May you get a good son.” The girl replied
<>that she was still unmarried. Ga1lava then made a figure
<>of a male with darbha and told her to get a child from
<>that figure. She was a Vais4ya girl named Vi1rabhadra1
<>and she got a beautiful child of that darbha male.
<>Because the boy was born to a Vais4ya of a brahmin
<>male he belonged to the Ambas2t2ha caste. The boy was
<>named Amr2ta1ca1rya.
<HI>DHANYAMA1LA1. The foster-mother of Atika1ya. (See

<>wife Dhu1mra1. (S4loka 19, Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<HI>DHARA II. A king who was a friend of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4loka 39, Chapter 158, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHA1RA. A holy place. If one bathes in this holy
<>place (Bath) his sorrows will be at an end. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanza 25).
<HI>DHA1RAN2A1. One of the eight means of Ra1jayoga (One
<>of the ways of union with the supreme Spirit). Yama,
<>Niyama, A1sana, Pra1n2a1ya1ma, Pratya1ha1ra, Dha1ran2a1,
<>Dhya1na and Sama1dhi are the eight means (See under
<>Ra1jayoga).
<HI>DHA1RAN2A I. A king born in the family of Candra-

<>Kas4yapa. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Stanza
<>16).
<HI>DHARAN2A(M). A measure. In ancient times a dharan2a
<>was made up of ten palas. (Manusmr2ti).
<HI>DHARA1PA1LA. A king of ancient times. He ruled over
<>a country named Vidis4a1. There is a holy place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet. Dhara1pa1la cons-
<>tructed a temple at the confluence. There is a story also
<>for his doing so.
<NI>Once a S4iva-pa1rs2ada brought to S4iva a woman at a time
<>when Pa1rvati1 was away from the place. S4iva and the
<>woman were enjoying each other when Pa1rvati1 came
<>to the place. Getting angry she cursed the Pa1rs2ada and
<>made him into a fox. The fox came to the place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet and did penance
<>there and attained Moks2a. Dhara1pa1la saw the divine
<>plane coming down to take the Pa1rs2ada away and he,
<>therefore, constructed a temple at the place where the
<>plane landed. He then arranged scholars well versed
<>in Vedas and s4a1stras to read Padma Pura1n2a there. He
<>himself read Padma Pura1n2a and attained moks2a.
<>(Chapter 29, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHA1RES4VARI1. A goddess living in the ti1rtha (holy
<>bath) of Jambunada. This goddess is another form of
<>Pa1rvati1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>DHA1RIN2I1. A daughter born to the Manes (Pitr2s) crea-
<>ted by Brahma1, by their wife Svadha1. Dha1rin2i1 had an

<>mother of the devas, Satyavrata and Satyasena.
<>Satyasena became famous by slaying many cruel and
<>evil-natured Yaks2as, demons and spirits. Lamba1 gave
<>birth to R2s2abha and Vidyotana. R2s2abha got a son,
<>Indrasena. Vidyotana became the father of stanayitnu.
<>Kukubh delivered San3kat2a and San3kat2a became the
<>father of Ki1kat2a and Durgadeva. Ja1mi got a son Svarga
<>and of him was born Nandi1. Vis4va1 gave birth to Vis4va- [Page224-b+ 60]
<>devas and Sa1dhya1 to Sa1dhyas. These Sa1dhyas are different
<>from those born of Brahma1. Sa1dhyas became the father of
<>Arthasiddhi. Marutvati1 gave birth to Marutvat and
<>Jayanta. Vasu gave birth to eight sons and they were
<>known as As2t2avasus. Dron2a, the first of the As2t2avasus,
<>married Abhimati. Abhimati is known as Dhara1 also.
<>It was Dron2a and Dhara1 who were born as Nandagopa
<>and Yas4oda1 later. Pra1n2a, second of the As2t2avasus,

<>great ascetics. (See under Narana1ra1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%The daughter named Dharmavrata1.%} Dharmadeva got a
<>daughter named Dharmavrata1 of his wife Dharmavati1.
<>Dharmavrata1 was an ascetic and she was married to
<>Mari1ci, son of Brahma1. One day Mari1ci came back
<>from the forest after getting darbha and flowers extre-
<>mely tired and so after food lay down to rest. His wife
<>sitting by his side massaged his legs. The sage fell as-
<>leep. Then Brahma1 came there and Dharmavrata1
<>attended on him and worshipped him. Mari1ci, when he
<>woke up, finding Dharmavrata1 attending on another
<>man cursed her and made her into stone. Dharmavrata1
<>pleaded not guilty and standing inside a fire-pit did pen-
<>ance for ten thousand years. Brahma1 and other devas
<>appeared before her and consoled her by assuring that
<>though she would be a stone devas would take their
<>abode in it and that she would be worshipped by all.
<>From that day onwards that stone was known as Devas4ila1
<>and even now it is believed that Brahma1 and other
<>devas live therein. (Chapter 114, Agni Pura1n2a).

<NI>(7) Dharmadeva went to Vis4va1mitra in the guise of
<>Vasis2t2ha to test him. (See para 3 of Ga1lava).
<NI>(8) Following a directive from Brahma1, Dharmadeva
<>once brought before Varun2a all the daityada1navas bound
<>by ropes. (Chapter 128, Udyoga Parva).
<NI>(9) Maha1vis2n2u was born as a son of Dharmadeva. (See
<>under Narana1ra1yan2a). [Page225-a+ 65]
<NI>(10) Dharma worshipped a brahmin named Satya tak-
<>ing the form of a deer. (S4loka 17, Chapter 272, S4a1nti
<>Parva).
<NI>(11) Dharma tested Sudars4ana taking the form of a
<>brahmin. (S4loka 79, Chapter 2, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(12) Dharma saved a sage named Vatsana1bha from a
<>great downpour taking the shape of a buffalo. (Chapter
<>12, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(13) Dharma disguised as a brahmin, went and impart-
<>ed advice to Janaka, father of Si1ta1. (Chapter 32, As4va-
<>medha Parva).
<NI>(14) To test Jamadagni, Dharma went to his a1s4rama
<>taking the form of Anger. Jamadagni had just milked
<>Ka1madhenu and kept the milk in a pot. Dharma as
<>Anger crept into the milk. Jamadagni drank it and yet
<>remained calm. Seeing this Dharma appeared before
<>him in the form of a Brahmin and blessed him assuring
<>Jamadagni that in future he would be obedient to
<>Dharma (Chapter 91, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(15) When at the fag end of their life the Pa1n2d2avas
<>started on their Maha1prastha1na, Dharma as a dog
<>accompanied them up to the gates of heaven. (S4loka
<>22, Chapter 5, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).
<NI>7) {%Dharma and Ka1la.%} There is a misunderstanding found
<>even in some Pura1n2as that Ka1la, the chief of Ka1lapuri1,
<>and Dharma are one and the same person. But if the
<>stories around each are examined it is easy to deduce
<>that they are two different devas. The father and
<>mother of Dharmadeva is Brahma1. The father of Ka1la
<>is Su1rya and mother Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1.
<>This itself is a sufficient evidence to show that the two
<>are different persons. Further, Ka1la or Yama is the
<>sixth descendant of Vis2n2u.
<NI>But scholars are misled to think that the two are iden-
<>tical. There is a reason for it.

<NI>The above are the synonyms of Ka1la. Vya1sa has used as
<>synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Maha1bha1rata the
<>words Dharmara1ja, Vr2s2a and Yama. Now among the
<>synonyms for the two there are two words in common--
<>Dharmara1ja and Yama. This has led to this misunder-
<>standing. Because Ka1la weighs the evil and good in
<>man he got the name Dharmara1ja. Dharmadeva got
<>that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma.
<>The real name of Ka1la is Yama. Dharmadeva got the
<>name Yama because he possesses ‘Yama’ (control of
<>the self for moral conduct). Ka1la has no sons; Vidura
<>and Yudhis2t2hira are the sons of Dharmadeva.

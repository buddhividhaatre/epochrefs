<NI>1) {%Birth.%} A story about the birth of Sa1mba, occurs in
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4, as follows:
<NI>Children were born to Rukmin2i1 and the other wives of
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. But Ja1mbavati1 alone did not give birth to
<>children. Ja1mbavati1 was filled with sadness when she
<>saw the children of her co-wives. One day she went to
<>the presence of Kr2s2n2a and requested him to give her a
<>son like Pradyumna. Hearing this, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went to
<>the mountain where the hermit Upamanyu did
<>penance and making the hermit his teacher, according
<>to his advice, did penance before Paramas4iva. He did
<>penance for the period of a month holding a skull and
<>a hermit's rod. He did penance in the second month,
<>standing only on one leg and drinking water alone.
<>In the third month Kr2s2n2a did penance standing on the
<>toes using only air as food. When the penance was
<>continued for six months in this state, Paramas4iva
<>appeared as Sa1mba (Ardhana1ri1s4vara) and asked what
<>boon he wanted. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a expressed his wish. S4iva
<>said that Ja1mbavati1 would get a son. Soon Ja1mbavati1
<>gave birth to a son. The child was named Sa1mba.
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Sa1mba married Laks2an2a1 the beautiful
<>daughter of Duryodhana. Hearing about the Svayam3-
<>vara marriage of Laks2an2a1, Sa1mba went to Hastina1pura
<>and took her by force from among the various Kings
<>who were present there. Duryodhana and the others
<>captured him. This news reached Dva1raka1 through [Page677-b+ 65]
<>Na1rada. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadrara1ma went to
<>Hastina1pura and rescued Sa1mba and took the bride
<>and the bridegroom to Dva1raka1. Ten sons beginning
<>with Sumitra were born to Sa1mba by his wife Laks2an2a1.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>3) {%Prabha1vati1 abducted.%} Prabha1vati1 was the daughter
<>of Vrajana1bha, the King of Supuranagari1. Sa1mba,
<>with his brother Pradyumna entered the city Supura
<>in the guise of drama-actors with a view to kidnap the
<>beautiful daughter of Vrajana1bha. They produced four
<>performances such as ‘Rambha1bhisa1ra’ and three other
<>dramas and earned the praise of everybody in Supura.
<>In this way they got access to the palace of the King,
<>and when the time suited, they took away Prabha1vati1
<>to Dva1raka1. (Harivam3s4a, 2: 93).
<NI>4). {%The delivery of an iron rod.%} Once some Ya1davas
<>with Sa1mba at their head abused Kas4yapa and some
<>other hermits who came to Dva1raka1. They cursed the
<>Ya1davas, in consequence of which Sa1mba gave birth
<>to an iron pestle, which caused the extermination of
<>the Ya1davas. (See under Kr2s2n2a, Para 39, Sub Para 2).
<NI>5) {%The curse of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Sa1mba was extremely hand-
<>some, and even the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a fell in love with
<>him. Under the circumstances Sa1mba tended to be-
<>come wicked. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to know of the unnatu-
<>ral attachment between his wives and Sa1mba, from
<>Na1rada and cursed Sa1mba that he would become a
<>leper, and cursed his own wives, that they would be
<>carried away by thieves and plunderers. Accordingly
<>Sa1mba became a leper and the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a were
<>carried away by the A1bhi1ras, after the submerging of
<>Dva1raka1.
<NI>After a few years, according to the advice of Na1rada,
<>Sa1mba began to worship the Sun, at a place called
<>Sa1mbapura in the basin of the river Candrabha1ga1, to
<>get recovery from leprosy. A brahmin also was brought
<>from S4uka (Kus4a) island to perform the fast and vow cor-
<>rectly. (Sa1mba 3; Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Bra1hma Parva, 66.

<>with the iron pestle, Sa1mba also was killed. (M.B.
<>Mausala Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 44).
<NI>(xi) After his death, Sa1mba entered the group of

<HI>SA1MBA II. A Brahmin scholar. When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>started for the forest towards the close of his life, the
<>people bade him farewell. This Brahmin stood among
<>the people and spoke words of consolation. (M.B.
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 13).
<HI>S4AMBARA I. An asura.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Various Pura1n2as refer to this leader of the
<>asuras as having played a prominent part in the dev-
<>a1sura war. After many such wars he was killed by
<>S4iva.
<NI>2) {%S4ambara's magic power.%} He possessed marvellous
<>magic powers. Once while fighting with him, the
<>Devas were non-plussed by his magical powers, and
<>they hid themselves in a forest. S4ambara was pleased
<>and he roamed about freely without any fear and
<>burnt the palaces of the protectors of the world. The
<>Devas left their homes and disappeared in disguise.
<>The Devas began killing those whom S4ambara had
<>appointed as army-chieftains. To counter this attack
<>by the Devas, he created three powerful asuras by his
<>powers of magic. The three asuras called Dama,
<>Vya1la and Ghat2a began killing the warriors of the
<>Devas, and the Devas told Brahma1 at Satyaloka about
<>the depredations of the asura. Brahma1 encouraged
<>them for further fighting, and the three asuras were
<>killed and S4ambara ran away and hid himself.
<>(Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha Sthitiprakaran2am).
<NI>3) {%S4ambara in R2gveda.%} There are various references

<>and trenches in those cities were very strong. The
<>forts are referred to as As4vamayi1, A1yasi1, S4atabhuji1 etc.
<>in the R2gveda. The chief enemies of the Aryans were
<>the race of people called Pan2is in the city. There is a
<>hint about the killing of S4ambara in Su1kta 17, Anuva1ka
<>8, Man2d2ala 1 of the R2gveda.
<NI>4) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(i) S4ambara was Kas4yapapraja1pati's son by his wife

<>into a tree to enjoy her beauty with his eyes. Laks2man2a,
<>who was felling down trees to build an a1s4rama felled
<>this tree also, which disappeared immediately leaving

<>of the Ra1ks2asa and Ra1ma comforted Si1ta1 and Laks2man2a

<>Aran2yaka1n2d2a).
<NI>Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a contains a story of how Devavati1
<>(or Vedavati1) daughter of Kus4adhvaja once cursed
<>S4ambhu. Devavati1 was born from the mouth of
<>Kus4adhvaja (son of Br2haspati) while he was learning
<>the Vedas. S4ambhu wanted to marry the child when
<>she was grown up, but Kus4adhvaja did not consent to
<>it, and S4ambhu, in retaliation, killed Kus4adhvaja in
<>his sleep. Next morning Devavati1 awoke from sleep to

<>Her curse was a contributory cause for the death of
<>S4ambhu by Laks2man2a.

<HI>S4AMBU1KA. A S4u1dra muni. During the reign of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma a great number of children died in the country
<>and many parents wept before the king about the loss of
<>their offsprings. According to Vasis2t2ha's advice Ra1ma
<>enquired whether anybody indulged in actions not
<>proper to his station in life. S4ri1 Ra1ma surveyed the
<>country from the air in a Vima1na, and during the
<>survey he found S4ambu1ka, the s4u1dra muni hanging with
<>his head down and inhaling smoke from a fire lit under
<>him. Thus, having found out that the tapas by that
<>s4u1dra was the reason for the children's death, Ra1ma [Page679-a+ 64]
<>killed S4ambu1ka immediately. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Uttaraka1n2d2a).
<HI>SAMED2I1. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (M.B. S4alya

<>Duryodhana in the fight which ensued at the time of
<>the great procession conducted by the Kauravas, to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas in the forest.
<HI>SAM3GHAM (SAN3GHAM). An organisation formed in
<>olden days for the cultivation of S4entamil (classic
<>Tamil) literature, which took its origin in south
<>Dra1vid2a land in the 4th century B.C. The Pa1n2d2yas set
<>up three San3ghams for the promotion of this literature,
<>the first one in southern Madura. When the city was
<>swept by erosion of the sea they set up the second
<>San3gham at Kapa1t2apura. When Kapa1t2apura also was
<>destroyed by the sea, the third San3gham was founded
<>in Dra1vid2a Madura. The first San3gham was called
<>Mutarcan3kam, the second It2aiccan3kam and the third
<>one Kat2aiccan3kam. Reliable information about the
<>first two San3ghams is not available. But, there are
<>reasons to believe that a San3gham called Kataiccan3kam
<>flourished for about six hundred years from 2nd
<>century B.C. to the close of the 4th century A.D.
<>(History of Kerala Literature by Ullu1r, Part 1, Page
<>47).
<NI>The Pa1n2d2yan King had built at Madura a hall
<>(man2d2apa) for the poets and scholars of the third
<>San3gham to assemble together to produce their works.
<>Even to this day there exists a temple called
<>San3ghatta1rkovil at the south-western corner of the
<>outer sector of the Sundares4vara temple. There the
<>idols of Sarasvati1 and of the fortynine poets of the
<>San3gham are being worshipped even today. The growth
<>and influence of the Buddhist and the Jain religions
<>and also that of the Pallava royal dynasty, contributed
<>to the downfall of the San3gham. The San3gham poets
<>have written many excellent books. According to
<>legends, Agastyam is a text on grammar of the first
<>San3gham and Tolka1pyam of the second San3gham.
<>There were authoritative text books on music written by
<>the last poets of the San3gham. But, none of these books
<>has been unearthed yet. Again, references are found
<>to dramas like Muruval, Jayantam, etc. They too
<>have not yet been found out. Five maha1ka1vyas (Epic
<>poems) and five short Ka1vyas also belong to San3gham
<>works. Purana1nu1ru. Akana1nu1ru, Patit2t2uppattu, Aim3
<>kurunu1ru, Kalittokai, Kuruntokai, Paripa1t2al and
<>Nat2t2in2ai are included in the San3gham work called
<>Et2t2uttokai. Most of them are collections of many com-
<>positions. The authorship of the four hundred songs in
<>Purana1nu1ru is distributed among nearly 160 poets.
<>Aim3 Kurunu1ru contains five hundred songs by five
<>poets. These five hundred songs were collected by the
<>scholar, Ku1t2alu1r kizha1r, on the orders of the Cera
<>King, Ceralirum3pozhai. Patit2t2ippattu is a collection
<>of songs composed by ten poets in praise of the Cera
<>Kings. But, only eight of these from two to nine are
<>available yet. Pattuppa1t2t2u comprised of the follow- [Page679-b+ 63]
<>ing works like Tirumuruka1ttuppat2ai, etc. Tirukkural,
<>Na1lat2iyar etc. are among the eighteen works under
<>the group Patinen2ki1zhkkan2akku. Cilappadika1ram,
<>Man2imekhalai, Ji1vakacinta1man2i, Kun2d2alakes4i1 and
<>Valaiya1pati are the five great ka1vyas and Ni1lakes4i,
<>Cu1d2a1man2i, Yas4oda1ka1vyam, Na1gakuma1ra-Ka1vyam and
<>Udayakuma1raka1vyam (Udayan2ankatai) are the five
<>short (laghu) ka1vyas. Amongst the above ka1vyas
<>Man2imekhalai and Kun2d2alakes4i are Buddhist ka1vyas
<>and Cinta1man2i and the five short ka1vyas are Jain
<>works. The last seven books might have been written
<>after the San3gham period. Tiruttakkatevar, author of
<>Cinta1man2i, lived in eighth century A.D. Some of the
<>songs in Purana1nu1ru are the oldest among the works of
<>the San3gham period. References to Cera Kings are
<>found in many of these works.

<NI>2) {%Separation from husband.%} Sam3jn5a1 lacked the power to
<>put up with the heat of Su1rya. She once went into the
<>forest to perform Tapas after deputing her companion,
<>Cha1ya1, to serve her husband. Sam3jn5a1 left her three
<>sons Manu, Yama, and Yami1 also in the charge of
<>Cha1ya1, who in the guise of Sam3jn5a1 served Su1rya. He
<>took her to be his wife and begot three children, S4anais4-
<>cara, (another) Manu and Tapati1 of her. Cha1ya1 once
<>got angry and cursed Yama, son of Sam3jn5a1. Then it
<>was that Su1rya realised that she was not his wife.
<>Su1rya felt very sad at this separation from his wife and
<>went to the forest in search of her. He knew, by the
<>power of his meditation, that Sam3jn5a1 was doing tapas
<>in the guise of a mare. Then he assumed the form of a
<>horse and begot of the mare the As4vini1kuma1ras and
<>Revanta. The As4vini1kuma1ras named Na1satya and Dasra,

<>complained to her father Vis4vakarman, that life with
<>Su1rya was impossible on account of his excessive heat,
<>and so Vis4vakarman ground Su1rya on his drilling
<>machine and reduced his heat. But, only (1/8) of the heat
<>(effulgence) could be so reduced, and it was with that
<>fraction of effulgence that Vis2n2u's disc (cakra), S4iva's
<>tris4u1la (trident), Kubera's pus2pakavima1na and Subrah-

<>Marka, who were priests of the asuras and whose

<>two priests to their side by offering them Soma and

<>after some time, began a yajn5a, S4an2d2ha and Marka
<>approached them for the promised Soma, but the Devas
<>did not keep their word, and the disillusioned S4an2d2hamar-

<HI>SANDHA1NAKARAN2I1. (See under Mr2tasan5ji1vani1).

<HI>SANDHYA1 III. Time of union or conjunction. There are
<>three Sandhya1s in a day. These are morning sandhya1
<>(Pra1tah2sandhya1), noon sandhya1 (Madhya1hna sandhya1)
<>and evening sandhya1 (Sa1yam3 Sandhya1). The meeting
<>time of night and day, is morning Sandhya1, the joining
<>time of the first half and the second half of the day,
<>is noon (Madhya1hna Sandhya1), and the joining time of
<>day and night, is evening Sandhya1 (Sa1yam3 sandhya1).
<>Brahmins should keep the three Sandhya1s properly.
<>The morning sandhya1 is of three kinds. Good, Medium
<>and Bad. When the morning stars are seen and the sun-
<>rise is approaching it is good morning; when the stars
<>are not seen and the sun is not risen it is medium
<>sandhya1 and the morning time after the sunrise is bad
<>Sandhya1. In sa1yam3sandhya1 also there is this difference
<>of time, as good, medium and bad. The time till the sun-
<>set is good; the time after the sunset and before the
<>rising of the stars is medium and the evening after the
<>rising of the stars is bad. In the Vedas it is metaphoric-
<>ally mentioned that Brahmins are trees, and the three
<>sandhya1s are their roots, the Vedas, their branches and
<>the rites and rituals ordained in the Vedas their leaves.
<>From this it is clear that Brahmins should on no
<>account leave unobserved, worships at these three
<>sandhya1s. The Brahmin who does not observe these three
<>sandhya1s carefully will, in his life time, become a
<>s4u1dra and after the death, will be born again as a dog.
<>Moreover the Brahmin who does not do the three even-
<>ing, morning and noon worships, will have no right to
<>conduct any other Vedic rites.
<NI>After the sun-rise and sun-set, within three na1zhikas
<>(a na1zhika-24 minutes) the morning and evening wor-

<HI>SAN5JAYA I. Minister of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} San5jaya, who was equal to a hermit, was
<>born as the son of Su1ta from a portion of Gavalgan2a.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 68, Verse 93).
<NI>2) {%The boon of San5jaya.%} San5jaya who was born within
<>the circle of the friends of the Kauravas, became the
<>minister of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. The great work that San5jaya
<>did in Maha1bha1rata was, telling Dhr2tara1s2t2ra every
<>thing that was taking place in the battle-field without
<>leaving even the smallest events in the order of their
<>occurrence. San5jaya was able to do this because of
<>the boon granted by Vya1sa.
<NI>When the armies of the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas
<>pitched their camps on either side of the battlefield,
<>Vedavya1sa came to Hastina1pura and saw Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra heard about the preparations on either side
<>for the battle. He did not like to go to the battle-field
<>and see for himself the events of the battle. He said so to
<>Vya1sa. Then Vya1sa called San5jaya to him and said
<>“San5jaya shall see all the events of the battle directly.
<>He shall have such a divine inward eye.” Vya1sa con-
<>tinued. “O king! San5jaya has inward eyes. He will tell
<>you everything about the battle. He will be knowing all.
<>Whenever he thinks of it he will see everything that
<>takes place in the day and in the night in open, and
<>in secret. No weapon will cut him and no weariness
<>will affect him. He is the son of Gavalgan2a and will
<>come away unhurt from the battle.”
<NI>Because of this blessing San5jaya used to inform
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of all the events in the battle at the time
<>of the occurrence. San5jaya informed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of the
<>news up to the death of Duryodhana. When
<>Duryodhana was killed the cry of As4vattha1ma1 grew
<>louder. San5jaya who heard this cry early in the
<>morning, ran to the battlefield with a broken heart.
<>With the death of Duryodhana the boon of inward eye
<>given to San5jaya by Vya1sa was lost. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 2; Sauptika Parva, Chapter 9). [Page684-a+ 64]

<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas had pitched their tents in

<>Chapter 159, Verse 8).
<NI>(xv) At this time Vya1sa came there and gave
<>San5jaya the boon that he would see directly every
<>thing that took place in the battlefield and would
<>inform Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 2,
<>Verse 10).

<>qualities of the earth, the island of Sudars4ana, the
<>death of Bhi1s2ma, and so on. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva;
<>Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(xvii) San5jaya gave the names of every one who was
<>killed on the side of the Kauravas. (M.B. Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 5).
<NI>(xviii) San5jaya reported to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra about those
<>who died on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas also. (Karn2a,
<>Parva, Chapter 6). [Page684-b+ 65]
<NI>(xix) San5jaya told Dhr2tara1s2t2ra about those who were
<>alive on the side of the Kauravas. (Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 7).
<NI>(xx) Sa1tyaki took San5jaya as a captive. (S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 57).
<NI>(xxi) Due to the blessings of Vya1sa San5jaya escaped
<>from the captivity of Sa1tyaki. (S4alya Parva, Chapter

<NI>(xxiv) Towards the close of his life San5jaya went with
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 to the forest. (A1s4ramava1sika
<>Parva, Chapter 15, Verse 8).
<NI>(xxv) On the first day of this journey to the forest,

<NI>4). {%The End.%} While Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the others were
<>walking along the forest a jungle-fire was seen. Instant-
<>ly it encircled them. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra cried out to San5jaya
<>to run for his life. But San5jaya did not like to forsake
<>them in that danger. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra said that since they
<>had left home and country there was no wrong in
<>dying by jungle fire. At last yielding to the compulsion
<>of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, San5jaya ran away from the jungle-fire.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 died in the wild-fire.
<>San5jaya reached the basin of the Ganges and informed

<HI>SAN5JAYA III. Another prince of the country of Sauvi1ra.
<>Vidula1 was the mother of this prince. This prince once

<HI>S4AN3KARA I. A synonym of S4iva.
<HI>S4AN3KARA II. A simpleton, who was killed by his
<>wife. This brahmin had a very mean wife called
<>Kalipriya1. After killing her husband she left the place
<>with her paramour. But, wild animals killed him on
<>their way in the forest. In all repentance Kalipriya1
<>returned home and after worshipping the corpse of her
<>husband she observed Ka1rttika vrata at the instance of
<>certain women. Thereby she got absolution from sin
<>and attained heaven. (Padma Pura1n2a, Brahmakhan2d2a,
<>Chapter 10).
<HI>S4AN3KARA1CA1RYA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The spiritual and philosophical preceptor
<>of India. S4ri1 S4an3kara was born in the village of Ka1lat2i
<>on the banks of the holy river Periya1r, also called
<>Cu1rn2a1 and Pu1rn2a1. According to certain scholars he was
<>born in 509 B.C. while certain others contend that he
<>saw the light of day in 84 A.D. Yet others place his
<>date of birth in various periods between 509 B.C. and 84
<>A.D. Whatever that may be, the great a1ca1rya is be-
<>lieved to have lived only for 32 years.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} The name of S4an3kara's father was S4ivaguru
<>and that of his mother A1rya1mba1. This nambu1diri couple
<>had no issues for a long time. So they went to Tr2s4s4iva-
<>peru1r (Trichur) to worship S4iva in the famous S4iva
<>temple there. The idol in that temple is known as
<>Vr2s2a1cales4vara and Vat2akkunna1tha also. Ere long Lord
<>S4iva blessed them with a son. The belief is still held
<>that, pleased with the prayer of S4ivaguru and A1rya1mba1
<>S4iva himself was born as their son. The child began
<>exhibiting extraordinary intellectual powers. At the age
<>of five the boy S4an3kara was invested with the sacred
<>thread. By the time he was eight years old he had
<>earned deep erudition in the Vedas, S4a1stras, Pura1n2as,
<>epics (itiha1sas) etc. His father was no more by then
<>and on the mother devolved the duty of bringing the
<>child up.
<NI>3) {%Crocodile-attack.%} The boy showed no taste for or
<>interest in childish plays, but evinced a tendency to-
<>wards a life of renunciation. This attitude of the son
<>pained the mother much and she wanted her son to get
<>married. But, the boy did not like the idea. As fate
<>would have it, an incident which proved to be a turning
<>point in the boy's life occurred soon. One day the
<>mother and her son were bathing in the Periya1r,
<>when a crocodile caught hold of the boy. He cried
<>aloud, and the mother got greatly alarmed. There was a
<>custom for one to take to sannya1sa, irrespective of circum-
<>stances, when danger or death threatened one, and that
<>is called a1patsannya1sa. S4an3kara prayed to his mother
<>for permission to take to sannya1sa at that moment when
<>his end was near, and willynilly the mother granted per-
<>mission. All at once the crocodile, which had so unex- [Page685-b+ 63]
<>pectedly attacked him, disappeared equally unexpectedly.
<>The boy came out of the river absolutely unhurt. The
<>decision to take to sannya1sa was taken once for all.
<>S4an3kara assured his mother, before he started on a tour
<>of the country, that he would be present at her bedside
<>during her last days and also that he would duly perform
<>her obsequies.
<NI>4) {%In the presence of the preceptor.%} S4an3kara, who then
<>was not even seven years old, started for the north in
<>quest of a preceptor, and on the banks of the Narmada1
<>he saw Govinda-bhagavatpa1da, the disciple of S4ri1
<>Gaud2apa1da. The Bhagavatpa1da was sitting in a cave
<>surrounded by many wise people. S4an3kara approached
<>and requested him to admit him as a disciple and grant
<>him sannya1sa. S4an3kara's prayer was granted.
<NI>5) {%Controlled flood.%} A wonderful thing happened while
<>S4an3kara was living at the a1s4rama. The Narmada1 was
<>in spate and the huts on its banks were about to be
<>submerged in water. People got alarmed. Then S4an3kara
<>put his kaman2d2alu (vessel which sannya1sins keep with
<>them for water) and chanted the Jala1kars2an2a Mantra.
<>(hymn to attract water). At once the water which had
<>flooded the banks flowed back into the river. People
<>and their huts were saved. Afterwards his Guru asked
<>S4an3kara to go to and live in Ka1s4i1 and write Bha1s2yas
<>(commentaries) on the Prastha1natrayam, i.e. the Brahma-
<>su1tras, the Upanis2ads and the Gi1ta1.
<NI>6) {%Padmapa1da.%} Accordingly S4an3kara went to Ka1s4i1. It
<>was there that he took as his first disciple Vis2n2us4arman,
<>a young man from the Cola region of the country.
<>S4an3kara called him Sanandana. Afterwards other disci-
<>ples also came in. But, gradually jealousies cropped
<>up in the ranks of the disciples. The other disciples of
<>S4an3kara thought that the latter was partial towards
<>Sanandana and showed special affection and regards
<>to him. S4an3kara then decided to prove to the others
<>that Sanandana was a disciple of exceptional talents and
<>merits. One day S4an3kara was bathing with his other
<>disciples in the Gan3ga1, and he called Sanandana who
<>was on the other side of the river to go to him. Sanan-
<>dana walked on the surface of the water to his Guru,
<>and as he took each step a lotus flower appeared beneath
<>and held him up from sinking into the water. From
<>that day onwards he came to be called Padmapa1da,
<>and his colleagues also realised his greatness.
<NI>7) {%Hasta1malaka.%} Hasta1malaka was one of the best disci-
<>ples of S4an3kara. There is a story about his becoming
<>S4an3kara's disciple. He was born dumb. His father,
<>Diva1kara took Hasta1malaka to S4an3kara believing that
<>due to the blessing of the great Guru his son would gain
<>powers of speech. S4an3kara asked the dumb boy, ‘who
<>are you?’ and the boy answered, ‘I am the soul, which
<>has no relationship with the parts and attributes of body
<>and mind and which is also entirely different from them’.
<>There were certain verses, which the boy recited as
<>answer to S4an3kara's question and each verse ended with
<>‘nityopalabdhisvaru1pohama1tma1’ (I am the a1tman and
<>eternal knowledge, consciousess, is its characteristic).
<>The boy's answer pleased S4an3kara, who took him as a
<>disciple of his. The boy was given sannya1sa under
<>the name Hasta1malaka the meaning of which word is
<>he who is in possession of knowledge like the goose-
<>berry in one's palm. [Page686-a+ 64]
<NI>8) {%Tot2aka1ca1rya.%} Tot2aka1ca1rya was a disciple, who came
<>soon after Hasta1malaka. The name Tot2aka1ca1rya has a
<>story behind it. This disciple approached S4an3kara with
<>his request for discipleship in verse praising the latter.
<>The verses were composed in the difficult tot2aka metre.
<>The verses attracted S4an3kara very much and he took the
<>applicant as disciple. His real name was Kala1na1tha, but
<>the Guru named him Tot2aka1ca1rya in view of his verses
<>in that metre.
<NI>9) {%The Can2d2a1laguru.%} There is a story about S4iva going
<>to S4an3kara at Ka1s4i1 in the guise of a Can2d2a1la and
<>S4an3kara receiving him. One morning S4an3kara, after
<>bathing in the Gan3ga1, was returning to the Vis4vana1tha
<>temple. A Can2d2a1la with his hunting dogs and a pot of
<>liquor was advancing from the opposite direction of
<>S4an3kara, who asked the former to move away from his
<>path. Immediately the Can2d2a1la asked, which, the
<>body or soul, is to remove itself from the path? The
<>body of everybody is composed of blood, flesh, bones
<>etc; the constitution of it also is the same. But, the
<>A1tman is universal and omnipresent. Whom-which of
<>the two-are you asking to move away from your path?
<>S4an3kara realised from the above answer that the Can2d2a1la
<>was an extraordinary person. In fact, it was Siva, who
<>had disguised himself as a Can2d2a1la. S4an3kara prostrated
<>before him. S4an3kara thought about God saying that
<>he who had attained Brahman and the consciousness
<>of oneness with all, was his Guru, whether he be a
<>Brahmin or a Can2d2a1la.
<NI>10) {%Derisive of the grammarian.%} S4an3kara has composed
<>a hymn named Mohamudgara, in which he ridicules a
<>grammarian. One day walking along a street in Ka1s4i1
<>S4an3kara saw a grammarian learning by rote rules of
<>grammar, and then he composed the very sweet and beauti-
<>ful poem--Bhaja Govindam--to reveal the foolishness
<>of the grammarian repeating the useless rules of gram-
<>mar. By the very first verse of the poem S4an3kara revealed
<>the following truth: “Oh! fool! worship Govinda
<>(Bhaja Govindam) meditate upon Him. You meditate
<>upon Govinda realising the truth that when death
<>approaches, the grammatical su1tra “D2ukr2n5 Karan2e” will
<>not come to your aid.”
<NI>11) {%Saw Vya1sa.%} S4iva, when he appeared in the guise
<>of a Can2d2a1la to S4an3kara, had asked him to visit Badari-
<>ka1s4rama, and accordingly he went there and visited
<>Vya1sa. It was there that S4an3kara met his supreme
<>preceptor, Govindapa1da. He returned to Ka1s4i1 with the
<>blessings of Vya1sa and Govindapa1da and engaged him-
<>self in the writing of books.
<NI>12) {%S4an3kara's age.%} There is a legend about S4an3kara's
<>life. Brahma1 had allotted to him only eight years' life.
<>Before S4an3kara left his house at Ka1lat2i, a batch of
<>sannya1sins including Agastya and Na1rada came to the
<>house. The sannya1sins, who were pleased with the
<>reception accorded to them blessed S4an3kara to live for
<>sixteen years instead of the eight Brahma1 had permitted
<>him.
<NI>While S4an3kara was writing books at Muktiman2d2apa at
<>Man2ikarn2ika1 Ghat in Ka1s4i1 Vya1sa came there one day
<>in the guise of an old man, and there ensued a lengthy
<>discussion between the two. Padmapa1da recongnised
<>Vya1sa in the old man and told him and S4an3kara thus:
<>“How would there be peace and happiness in the world,
<>if S4an3kara, the incarnation of S4iva and Vedavya1sa, the [Page686-b+ 64]
<>incarnation of Vis2n2u quarrelled with each other?” As
<>soon as his identity was revealed thus, Vya1sa admitted
<>that S4an3kara's Bha1s2ya on the Brahmasu1tras was cor-
<>rect and blessed him to live for thirtytwo, instead of
<>sixteen years.
<NI>13) {%Controversy between S4an3kara and Man2d2anamis4ra.%}
<>Pandits (scholars) view the controversy or discussion
<>between S4an3kara and Man2d2anamis4ra as the most impor-
<>tant event in S4an3kara's life. Three incidents, S4an3kara's
<>meeting Kuma1rilabhat2t2a, his defeating Man2d2anamis4ra
<>and his entering the dead body of another person--may
<>be found in connection with the above controversy.
<NI>{%A: Meeting with Kuma1rilabhat2t2a.%} S4an3kara's object was
<>to expose the defects and draw-backs in Pu1rvami1ma1m3sa1
<>(the ritual part of the Vedas). Kuma1rilabhat2t2a was the
<>most competent person for a discussion on the subject.
<>S4an3kara, for this purpose, went to Praya1ga from Ka1s4i1.
<>But, Kuma1rilabhat2t2a was not in a condition fit for dis-
<>cussion. He was slowly burning himself to death in a
<>heap of paddy husk set on fire. He courted this punish-
<>ment voluntarily to atone for a wrong he had commit-
<>ted. Years back he had put on Buddhistic attire and
<>studied the secrets of Buddhistic religion from its precep-
<>tors with the object of refuting that religion. Kuma1-
<>rilabhat2t2a had great faith in Karmaka1n2d2a, and he
<>therefore, decided that it was his duty to make a tone-
<>ment for the wrong he had purposely done according
<>to injunctions laid down in Karmaka1n2d2a. S4an3kara was
<>very sorry to find Kuma1rilabhat2t2a in this condition in
<>which discussion could not be held with him on the
<>defects of Pu1rvami1ma1m3sa1. Kuma1rilabhat2t2a directed
<>S4an3kara to the great scholar, Man2d2anamis4ra at Ma1his2-
<>mati1 for a discussion on Pu1rvami1ma1m3sa1.
<NI>{%B. Man2d2anamis4ra defeated.%} When S4an3kara reached
<>Man2d2anamis4ra's house a ceremony connected with
<>obsequies was being conducted there. The door for
<>entry to the house was closed. S4an3kara, by his yogic
<>power entered the home and revealed the object of his
<>visit to Man2d2anamis4ra, who agreed to the proposal of
<>S4an3kara. Accordingly a debate began between the two.
<>Bha1rati1devi1, wife of Man2d2anamis4ra and an erudite
<>scholar in her own title acted as the arbiter in the discus-
<>sion. Before the debate started she put a garland of
<>flowers on the neck of both the contenders and announc-
<>ed that he would be considered as defeated in the
<>debate the garland on whose neck began fading first.
<>The debate continued for a number of days and the
<>garland on Man2d2anamis4ra's neck began showing signs
<>of fading. According to the terms and conditions of
<>the debate Man2d2anamis4ra acknowledged defeat. He
<>accepted S4an3kara's discipleship.
<NI>{%C. Paraka1yapraves4a (Entering the dead body of another
<>person).%} But, Bha1rati1devi1 argued that it was not enough
<>that S4an3kara had defeated her husband in debate. She
<>challenged him to defeat her as well, and S4an3kara
<>accepted the challenge. Many topics dealt with in
<>the various S4a1stras were debated upon and S4an3kara
<>won all those debates. Ultimately Bha1rati1devi1 raised
<>certain points connected with the science of sexual
<>love in the course of her arguments. S4an3kara admitted
<>that he did not possess sufficient mastery over the
<>subject as he had taken himself to sannya1sa even from
<>infancy. But, he told her that if he was allowed neces-
<>sary time for it he would debate on that topic also. [Page687-a+ 65]
<>Bha1rati1devi1 granted him time for it and the debate
<>was adjourned.
<NI>S4an3kara prepared himself for the study of the science
<>of sexual love. Just at that time a King called Amaruka
<>died. After asking his disciples to take especial care
<>of his body S4an3kara entered by yogic power the dead
<>body of Amaruka. The dead King came back to
<>life and his people felt very happy about the mysteri-
<>ous happening. S4an3kara, who had thus entered the
<>body of King Amaruka, lived in the palace enjoying
<>all royal pleasures. He gained practical experience
<>in the matter of sexual love from the queens in the
<>palace. People found the resurrected King Amaruka
<>to be better and more intelligent. The ministers suspect-
<>ed that the soul which dwelt in the body of the king
<>was of some one else. Under the impression
<>that it might be that of some yogin the ministers
<>deputed agents to various parts of the country to find
<>out if there was anywhere the dead body of a yogi1, and
<>they found out S4an3kara's body. It was about to be
<>burnt on the pyre when the disciples of S4an3kara met
<>King Amaruka at the palace and informed him about
<>these developments. Immediately S4an3kara quitted
<>his royal body and entered his own body now lying on
<>the funeral pyre. He prayed to S4ri1laks2mi1narasim3ha and
<>came out from the burning pyre.
<NI>S4an3kara returned immediately to Man2d2anamis4ra's
<>house and the debate was started again. Bha1rati1devi1
<>realised that S4an3kara could not be defeated in topics
<>related to the science of sex. Thus S4an3kara gained
<>absolute victory in his debate with Man2d2anamis4ra, who
<>then requested the former to grant him sannya1sa and
<>accept him as a disciple. S4an3kara did so. Bha1rati1devi1
<>too followed her husband in accepting sannya1sa.
<NI>14) {%Mother's death.%} S4an3kara now knew that it was time
<>for his mother's death. According to his promise to
<>her that he would be by her side at the time of her
<>death S4an3kara returned to Ka1lat2i. His mother expired,
<>and he made arrangments for cremation. But his rela-
<>tions did not cooperate with him and argued that it was
<>against the injunctions in the S4a1stras for a son, who had
<>taken to sannya1sa, to perform the cremation etc. of his
<>mother. At last, S4an3kara had to cremate his mother by
<>himself without others' help. He made a pyre with plan-
<>tain stems in the compound of his house, and cut his
<>mother's corpse into pieces, carried the pieces to the
<>funeral pyre and thus cremated the body.
<NI>15) {%Triumphal tour.%} After the cremation of his mother
<>S4an3kara set out on his triumphal tour of the country.
<>He is believed to have travelled throughout India three
<>times. Wherever he went he gained friends and also
<>made enemies. It was during these tours that he esta-
<>blished the four mat2has (centres) in the four regions
<>of the country. S4r2n3geri in the south, Jagana1tha in the
<>east, Dva1raka1 in the west and Badari1na1tha in the north
<>were the four chief mat2has established by S4an3kara and
<>they continue to function even to this day.
<NI>The S4iva, Vis2n2u and Devi1 temples and other Hindu
<>religious institutions to be found in India today very
<>eloquently proclaim the achievements and unique
<>reputation of S4an3kara. It is traditionally believed that
<>S4an3kara brought five lin3gas from Kaila1sa and installed
<>them in the five great temples. Muktilin3ga in Keda1ra,
<>Paralin3ga in the Ni1lakan2t2ha temple in Nepal, Moks2a
<>lin3ga at Cidambaram, Bhogalin3ga in S4r2n3geri and [Page687-b+ 65]
<>Yogalin3ga in Ka1n5ci1 are the five lin3gas installed by
<>S4an3kara. The ‘five-in-one’ method of worship was
<>also propounded by him. According to this system
<>A1ditya, Ambika1, Vis2n2u, Gan2ana1tha and Mahes4vara
<>are conjointly worshipped, special importance being
<>given by the worshipper to his special deity. S4an3kara
<>appointed one disciple of his each in each of the mat2has
<>as its head and these mat2has play the most important role
<>in the maintenance and propagation of the Advaita philo-
<>sophy. The heads of these mat2has during various periods
<>have been reputed Veda1ntists and noble souls. Jyotir-
<>mat2ha in Badarika1s4rama, Govardhana pi1t2ha in Jagan-
<>na1thapuri1, S4a1rada1 pi1t2ha in S4r2n3geri and Ka1makot2ipi1t2ha
<>in Ka1n5ci1 are the most important of the S4ri1 S4an3kara pi1t2has.
<>Having thus completed his philsophic mission or object
<>in life S4an3kara entered maha1sama1dhi at the age of thirty-
<>two. Some scholars believe that he disappeared in a
<>cave at Keda1ra while certain others hold the view that
<>he ascended the Sarvajn5api1t2ha (the omniscient state) at
<>Ka1n5ci1 and spent his closing days there.
<NI>16) {%His works.%} The literary compositions of S4an3kara may
<>be classified into four divisions, viz, Bha1s2yas (comment-

<>Devas, guests or cows. Nor did I do any pious deed.
<>But, one day I happened to worship Lord Vis4vana1tha

<>Sa1n3gaveda. (Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a).
<HI>S4A1NTIDEVA1 (S4A1NTIDEVI1). Daughter of King Devaka.
<>She was married by Vasudeva. (Va1yu Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>96, Verse 130).
<HI>S4A1NTIKALPA. One of the five sam3hita1 sections of the
<>Atharvaveda composed by muni Mun5jikes4a, the other
<>four sections being naks2atrakalpam, vedakalpam, sam3hi-
<>ta1kalpam and a1n3girasakalpam. Naks2atrakalpam con-
<>tains rules for the worship of the stars; Vedakalpam
<>contains the rites regarding Brahman, the R2tvik; sam3hi-
<>ta1kalpam contains the rules about mantras, and the
<>A1n3girsakalpam deals with black magic and s4a1ntikalpam [Page690-a+ 63]
<>contains rules about propitiating deities by offerings of
<>horse, elephant etc.
<HI>S4A1NTIPARVAN. An important Parva of the Maha1bha1rata
<>(See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>SANTURODHA. A king of the Pu1ru dynasty. He was
<>the son of Matina1ra. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 278).
<HI>SAN2U. A country of ancient India. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva Chapter 9, Verse 43).
<HI>SANYA1SA (SANNYA1SA) One of the four stages of
<>Brahminical life. The four stages are Brahmacarya
<>(Religious student), Ga1rhasthya (householder), Va1na-
<>prastha (Forest-dweller) and Sannya1sa (hermit or sage).
<>(For further details see under A1s4rama).
<NI>{%Duties of a hermit.%} Manu has ordained that one should
<>perform sannya1sa (renunciation) at the fourth stage of
<>life renouncing every tie with the world. After becoming
<>a hermit he should travel daily alone. He should enter
<>villages only for food. He should have renounced
<>wealth. He should not acquire any wealth. He should
<>be a sage filled with knowledge. He should have a
<>skull as the pot for taking alms. He should sleep under
<>trees. He should wear poor cloth and should be solitary.
<>He should consider everybody as equal. Having become
<>a hermit he should not delight in death or life.
<NI>A hermit should put every step looking straight down to
<>the earth. He should drink water filtered by cloth.
<>Words and deeds should be pure and true. The shells
<>of water-gourd (pumpkin), wooden pots and earthen
<>pots are the Vais2n2ava sign of hermits. A hermit should
<>beg for food daily from houses where no smoke comes
<>out, where pestle is placed and where there is no char-
<>coal, and after all have taken food and the pot for pre-
<>paring food is placed upside down.
<NI>It is said that the food got by hermits by begging is of
<>five types. They are Ma1dhu1kara (collected alms),
<>asam3kl2pta (unlimited), Pra1kpran2i1ta (prepared much
<>earlier), Aya1citam (got by not begging) and ta1tka1lika
<>(for the time being). In whichever stage of life he
<>may be, he should be staunch in that stage and should
<>perform the duties with honesty.
<NI>If by ignorance a hermit engaged himself in killing
<>animals by day or night, to remove the impurity and get
<>purity, he should bathe and perform six pra1n2a1ya1mas
<>(restraints of the breath) daily. The hermit should
<>discard his body made of five elements.
<NI>The signs of duty are, resolution, forbearance, selfres-
<>traint, not robbing, cleansing, control of sense-organs,
<>modesty, knowledge, truth, not resorting to anger, and
<>so on. Hermits are of four grades, such as Kut2i1caka,
<>Bahu1daka, Ham3sa and Paramaham3sa, the last-mentioned
<>being the noblest grade. The hermit who wears one or
<>three dan2d2as (rod) will be freed from ties of birth and
<>death.
<NI>The five Yamas or restraints are not killing (Ahim3sa1),
<>truth, not stealing, celibacy and not receiving. The
<>five Niyamas or religious duties are cleansing, joy or
<>contentedness, penance, self-study and meditation on
<>God. The sitting postures suitable for hermits are
<>Padma1sana etc. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 161).
<HI>SANYASTAPA1DA. A famous Pura1n2ic region in India.
<>The king of this kingdom, fearing Jara1sandha, ran away
<>to the south with his son. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 14,
<>Verse 28). [Page690-b+ 64]
<HI>SAPTACARU. A holy place. The reason for giving this
<>place the name Saptacaru is given in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 82 as follows:
<NI>The word ‘Caru’ means sacrifice. Once devas (gods)
<>and men together put the fat parts of sacrificial animals,
<>as burnt offerings in the sacrificial fire, each singing
<>seven verses from the R2gveda. By this sacrifice they
<>obtained more prosperity than the fruits of giving one
<>lakh of cows as alms or performing hundred Ra1jasu1ya
<>sacrifices or thousand horse-sacrifices.
<NI>“The wise said that it was an endless gift to the
<>manes. The gods, the manes, the Gandharvas, the
<>celestial maids, the gan2as, the yaks2as, Kinnaras, the
<>siddhas, the Vidya1dharas, the people of the earth, the
<>Ra1ks2asas, the daityas, the Rudras, Brahma1, all these
<>joined together with vow and fast taken for a thou-
<>sand years and performed a sacrifice each exalting
<>Vis2n2u by singing seven verses from R2gveda. Kes4ava
<>was much pleased at the caru and gave them A1s2tais4-
<>varyasiddhi (the eight miraculous attainments) and
<>everything they wished. Thus giving them all kinds of
<>prosperities, the god Mukunda disappeared in this place
<>as lightning in the clouds. Therefore this place became
<>famous everywhere by the name Saptacaru.”
<HI>SAPTADVIJA (S). The seven Brahmins who killed and
<>ate on the way the cow brought for the teacher.
<>These seven Brahmins were the disciples of a teacher
<>in Kun2d2inapura. Once owing to a severe famine people
<>were in a very difficult situation. The teacher sent these
<>seven disciples to beg for a cow from his son-in-law
<>who had a very large number of cows. They did
<>accordingly. The son in-law gave them a cow for his
<>father-in-law. The disciples began the return journey
<>with the cow. When they reached half-way they became
<>so weary and tired of hunger and walking that they
<>could not proceed a step further. When they reached
<>the stage of death, those celibates killed the cow
<>according to the Vedic rites, and ate the flesh. Carry-
<>ing the remaining flesh they reached the house of the
<>teacher and told him all the truth. As they had tried to
<>be righteous as far as possible, the teacher only felt
<>proud of his disciples. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5-
<>cuka1lambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>SAPTADVI1PAS (SEVEN ISLANDS).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The seven islands are Jambu1-
<>dvi1pa, Plaks2advi1pa, S4a1lmalidvi1pa, Kus4advi1pa,
<>Kraun5cadvi1pa, S4a1kadvi1pa and Pus2karadvi1pa. Each of
<>these islands is surrounded by sea. The sea that surrounds
<>Jambu1dvi1pa is the Lavan2a sea (salt sea), the Plaks2a
<>dvi1pa is surrounded by the sea of Sugarcane-juice,
<>S4a1malidvi1pa by the sea of liquor, Kus4advi1pa by the sea
<>of ghee, Kraun5cadvi1pa by the sea of curd S4a1kadvi1pa
<>by the sea of milk and the Pus2karadvi1pa by the sea of
<>pure water. In the centre of all, lies the Jambu1dvi1pa
<>and in the centre of this island, stands the golden
<>mountain meru. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 2).
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} There is a story about the origin of these
<>seven islands and the surrounding seas, in Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata Skandha 8.
<NI>Two famous sons named Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da
<>were born to Sva1yambhuva Manu. Priyavrata and his
<>children ruled the country for a period of eleven arbu-
<>das, that is a hundred million years. Though he was
<>aged so much the power of his mind and body did [Page691-a+ 64]
<>not show any sign of weakness. At this time he saw once
<>the sun travelling on the first side of the earth, and
<>began to think. “When the sun is walking on one
<>side of the earth, the other side must naturally be dark.
<>Will it happen so in our time? In all places at all
<>times it should be bright and there should be no dark-
<>ness.” Thinking thus he got into a chariot as bright as
<>the sun and travelled round the earth seven times.
<>During these travels the wheels of the chariot made
<>seven furrows on the earth. These furrows became the
<>seven seas and the beds between the furrows became
<>seven islands.
<NI>3) {%Sovereign powers.%} Priyavrata made his seven sons
<>sovereigns of the seven islands. These seven sovereign
<>rulers were Agni1dhra, Idhmajihva, Yajn5aba1hu,
<>Hiran2yaretas, Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Medha1tithi and Vi1tihotra.
<HI>SAPTAGAN3GA. An ancient holy place. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse
<>16, that if one goes to this place and gives offerings to
<>gods and the manes and worships them, one would
<>attain heaven and become a deva (god).
<HI>SAPTAGODA1VARA. A holy place near the temple of
<>S4u1rpa1raka. Those who bathe in this would attain
<>heaven. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 44).
<HI>SAPTAJANA1S4RAMA. A holy place where seven
<>hermits called the Saptajanas, went to heaven by
<>standing head downwards in water. This was the
<>place through which S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va went to
<>Kis2kindha1. Sugri1va told S4ri1 Ra1ma about the hermitage
<>of Saptajanas as follows:
<NI>“Oh! Ra1ghava! This vast area is the hermitage where
<>rest could be taken, as sweet fruits and pure water
<>could be obtained and the forest looks like a garden.
<>Here the seven hermits called Saptajanas, who did
<>penance and took vow and fast by standing in water
<>always, with heads downwards, did live in days of
<>old.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga
<>13).
<HI>SAPTAJIT. One of the daughters born to Kas4yapa by
<>his wife Danu. (Matsya Pura1n2a 6:19).
<HI>SAPTAKR2T. An eternal god concerned in S4ra1ddha
<>(offerings to the manes). (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 91, Stanza 36).
<HI>SAPTAMA1TR2(S). (SEVEN MOTHERS).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Saptama1tr2s are the seven
<>goddesses named Brahma1n2i1, Vais2n2avi1, Ma1hes4vari1,
<>Kauma1ri1, Va1ra1hi1, Indra1n2i1 and Ca1mun2d2i1.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} Some are of opinion that the Saptama1tr2s
<>are connected with S4iva. Their names reveal that they
<>were born from the bodies of Brahma1, Vis2n2u and such
<>other gods. There is another story that when S4iva and
<>Vis2n2u joined together and tried to kill the asura named
<>Andhaka and failed, they created the seven mothers to
<>kill the asura. From each drop of blood of Andhaka1sura
<>that fell on the ground an asura arose. These seven
<>ma1tr2s joined with Yoges4vari1, the creation of S4iva,
<>drank the blood of the asura without allowing it to
<>fall on the ground and so it became easy for S4iva to
<>kill the asura.
<NI>There is a story in Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 56,
<>ahout the birth of the Saptama1tr2s, as follows: In
<>olden days a fierce war broke out between the devas
<>and the asuras. When the fierce asuras Can2d2a and
<>Mun2d2a were killed the famous asura named Raktabi1ja [Page691-b+ 64]
<>entered the battlefield with an aks2auhin2i1 of army
<>(21870 chariots, so many elephants, 65610 horses and
<>109350 infantry). Seeing this immense army of the
<>asuras drawing near, Kaus4iki1, Mahes4vari1 and Ka1li1made
<>a loud roaring sound. Then from the mouth of
<>Mahes4vari1, Brahma1n2i1 came out seated on a swan and
<>wearing rosary and water pot. From her eyes Mahes4-
<>vari1 with three eyes came out seated on a bull and
<>wearing great snakes as bangles and ear-rings and
<>holding a trident. From the loins came out Kauma1ri1,
<>seated on a peacock and holding a lance. The beauti-
<>ful Vais2n2avi1 came out from her hand, seated on
<>Garud2a, holding a conch, discus, club, sword, the bow
<>s4a1rn3ga and arrow. From her posterior came out the
<>horrible Va1ra1hi1 (Boar) with a great pestle, seated on
<>the Na1ga (serpent) S4es2a, and furrowing the ground
<>with her fierce tusks. From her heart came out the
<>awful Na1rasim3hi1 (woman-lion) with fierce claws, who
<>at the shaking of her mane displaced the planets and
<>the stars, and from her foot Ca1mun2d2i1 came out. (See
<>under Pala1la1).
<HI>SAPTANA1GA (S). (Seven serpents). The Saptana1gas
<>are Ananta, Taks2aka, Karka, Padma, Maha1padma,
<>S4an3khaka and Gulika. All of them should be consecrat-
<>ed in temples as wearing Brahma-string and having the
<>face with the expanded hood of a serpent. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 51).
<HI>SAPTARA1VA (SAPTAVA1RA). One of the famous
<>children of Garud2a. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101,
<>Verse 11).
<HI>SAPTARS2IS. (The seven hermits). A group of hermits.
<>There are seven hermits in this group. The Saptars2is
<>in each Manvantara (age of Manu) are different. As
<>there are fourteen Manvantaras before a great deluge,
<>by that time ninetyeight Saptars2is will be born and
<>dead. The father of the Saptars2is in each Manu's age
<>will be different. The Saptars2is of the present Manu's
<>age, Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha
<>and Kratu are the mental sons of Brahma1. (For further
<>details see under the word Manvantara).
<HI>SAPTARS2IKUN2D2A. A holy bath (ti1rtha) situated

<>ti1rtha will obtain the merit of good actions.
<HI>SAPTASA1LA (S). The cursed forms of the King
<>Man2ibhadra's seven sons who were sorcerers. Due to

<>story see under Man2ibhadra II).
<HI>SAPTASAMUDRAS. (The seven seas). See under
<>Saptadvi1pa(s).
<HI>SAPTASA1RASVATA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A holy place situated within
<>Kuruks2etra. This is a holy bath dedicated to Sarasvati1.
<>Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 37, Verse 61, that during his pilgrimage Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma visited this holy bath.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} A story occurs in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 38 about the origin of this ti1rtha. It is
<>given below:--
<NI>Once Brahma1 performed a sacrifice on the island of
<>Pus2kara. All the devas (gods and goddesses) attended
<>the sacrifice. Among the rivers, Sarasvati1 alone did [Page692-a+ 64]
<>not come at first. Then Brahma1 remembered
<>Sarasvati1 and she appeared under the name Suprabha1.
<>Thus she appeared before the hermits who were doing
<>penance in that place assuming seven different figures.
<>From that day onwards the place became famous under
<>the name Saptasa1rasvata. (See under Sarasvati1).
<HI>SAPTA1S4VAS. The seven horses of the Sun. The chariot
<>of the Sun is nine thousand yojanas long and its shaft
<>is eighteen-thousand yojanas long. The length of the
<>axle is fifteen million seven lakhs yojanas. The wheel
<>is secured to this axle. The entire wheel of ‘Time’
<>(Ka1lacakra) stuck fast in the undiminishing figure of
<>‘year’ with three naves of the wheel, five spokes and
<>sixty rings. The chariot is drawn by seven horses.
<>They are the seven Vedic metres with their theory.
<>They are Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1, Tris2t2up,
<>Anus2t2up and Pan3kti. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter
<>8).

<HI>S4ARABHA II. A na1ga born in the Aira1vata dynasty.
<>It was burnt to death at Janamejaya's serpent yajn5a.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 11).

<>praja1pati by his wife Danu. (A1di Parva, Chapter 65,
<>Verse 26).
<HI>S4ARABHA IV. A mahars2i, who worships Yama in his
<>court. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 14).
<HI>S4ARABHA V. Brother of Dhr2s2t2aketu, King of Cedi. He
<>was a friend and supporter of the Pa1n2d2avas. During the
<>as4vamedha he helped Arjuna to lead the ya1jn5ic horse.
<>(As4vamedhika Parva, Chapter 83, Verse 3).
<HI>S4ARABHA VI. A brother of S4akuni. He was killed in
<>the great war by Bhi1ma. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 157,
<>Verse 24).
<HI>S4ARABHA VII Vi1rabhadra incarnated himself as
<>S4arabha to defeat Narasim3hamu1rti. (S4iva Pura1n2a,
<>S4atarudrasam3hita1).
<HI>S4ARABHAN3GA. A Mahars2i, who lived in the Dan2d2aka
<>forest during the ‘forest-life’ of S4ri1 Ra1ma. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto IV). When S4ri1
<>Ra1ma visited S4arabhan3ga's a1s4rama, Indra too came
<>there, but went away saying that he would meet the
<>mahars2i after the great mission of Ra1ma was over. The
<>mahars2i told Ra1ma that he was waiting to see him and
<>did not accompany Indra to Devaloka as he wanted to
<>go there only after seeing Ra1ma. Ra1ma answered the
<>Mahars2i that he would take upon himself all the
<>spiritual assets and good results of the actions of the
<>Mahars2i, and wanted him to point out a place for
<>them (Ra1ma and others) to live. S4arabhan3ga directed
<>them to the a1s4rama of Suti1ks2n2a, and after that ended
<>his life by leaping into the fire and attained Brahmaloka.
<HI>S4ARABHAN3GA1S4RAMA. A holy place. Those who
<>visit the place purify their families. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 85, Verse 42).
<HI>S4A1RADAN2D2A1YANI. A Kekaya King. His wife,
<>S4rutasena1 was the younger sister of Kunti1. As the
<>couple did not get a child even very long after their
<>marriage, the King got performed, with S4rutasena1's
<>permission, the ‘Pum3savana’ yajn5a with the result that [Page692-b+ 64]
<>three sons (Durjaya and others) were born to them.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 111).
<HI>S4ARADVA1N. A muni, the son of Gautama. From his
<>very infancy he preferred learning the dhanurveda
<>(science of archery) to the other Vedas. While a
<>brahmaca1rin (Religious student) he performed tapas
<>and secured divine arrows. Afterwards, having been
<>overcome by the charms and appeals of an apsara1
<>woman named Ja1napati1, S4aradva1n had seminal
<>emission from which were born Kr2pa and Kr2pi1. (For
<>details see under Kr2pa).
<HI>S4A1RADVATI1. An apsara1 woman. She attended the
<>birthday celebrations of Arjuna.
<HI>S4ARAGULMA. A monkey in Ra1ma's army. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kin2d2ha1 Ka1n2d2a, 41, 3).
<HI>SARAKATI1RTHA. A famous sacred place in Kuru-
<>ks2etra. He who takes his bath here on Caturdas4i1 day
<>of the dark half and worships S4iva will have all his
<>desires fulfilled and will attain heaven. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 83). Within this ti1rtha there are a crore of
<>other ti1rthas called Rudrakot2i, Ku1pakun2d2a etc. The
<>sacred place to the east of it is said to belong to Na1rada.
<HI>S4ARALOMA1. A mahars2i, the father of Da1s4u1ra.
<>Vasis2t2ha once told S4ri1 Ra1ma the story of Da1s4u1ra to
<>prove that the world is all an illusion.
<NI>Da1s4u1ra was the only son of S4araloma1, a muni, who
<>performed tapas in the plains of the mountain in
<>Magadha. Da1s4u1ra too did tapas in another part of
<>the mountain. While the father and the son were
<>living happily the father entered sama1dhi and the son
<>wept over the loss of his father. Then a forest-nymph
<>comforted him with celestial advice.
<NI>Da1s4u1ra performed his father's obsequies. He began
<>thinking that the earth was impure and that the top of
<>trees was pure and decided to do tapas in such a manner
<>that he got power to sit on the branches and leaves of
<>trees. Accordingly he made a big pit of fire and began
<>making offerings of flesh cut from his body into the fire.
<>Agnibhagava1n (Fire-deity) appeared and asked him to
<>choose the boons he wanted. Da1s4u1ra told Agni as
<>follows: “Oh Lord; I do not find any pure spot on this
<>earth, which is full of created living beings. You should
<>therefore, grant me the power to live on the tops of
<>trees.” Agni granted him the boon.
<NI>Da1s4u1ra then climbed a big tree in the forest and occu-
<>pied, without the least fear, a tender leaf at the top of
<>the topmost branch of the tree. He there assumed the
<>Padma1sana (the lotus seat for meditation). His mind
<>was functioning actively as it had not been turned in-
<>wards into true knowledge. With his mind in such a
<>state he performed yajn5a. He continued performing
<>yajn5as like gomedha, a vamedha etc. mentally for ten
<>years. Then self-illuminating knowledge arose in his
<>mind. and he saw a beautiful forest-nymph seated
<>beautifully attired at the end of the tender leaf on
<>which he was sitting. She was looking very sad, her
<>head bent down. Da1s4u1ra asked her, who she was so
<>much beautiful and attractive as to evoke love even in
<>Ka1ma (the God of love). She answered him in a sweet
<>voice as follows: “Very rare desires in life may be got if
<>great men are requested for. I am the forest-nymph
<>of this forest beautified by the tree you sit on and by
<>trees and creepers equally beautiful. An assembly of the
<>forest-nymphs has been held to celebrate a festival for [Page693-a+ 64]
<>the worship of Ka1madeva on trayodasi1 in the s4uklapaks2a
<>of the month of Caitra. I too went there, and I, who
<>am childless, felt sorry in mind to see the others petting
<>their children on their laps. But, why should I be sad
<>when you, who can give supplicants anything they wish
<>for, are here? You should, therefore, bless me with a
<>child or else I will end my life in fire.”
<NI>Da1s4u1ra blessed her to have a son within a month. He
<>told her also that it would be difficult for the son to
<>acquire knowledge as he was got on the insistence that
<>she would die in fire unless she got him. He did not
<>grant her request for permission to live with him; he
<>went into the forests leaving her behind him.
<NI>The son of the forest-nymph became twelve years old.
<>Then, one day, she took the child to the muni; left it
<>with him and went away. One day the father began
<>telling the son a story, on the top of the tree, and
<>Vasis2t2ha, who was going by the sky in invisible form
<>to bathe in Kaila1sagan3ga1, heard the story. Vasis2t2ha
<>hid himself on the tree and listened to the story.
<NI>It was the story of king Svottha that the muni was tell-
<>ing his son as follows:--“He was famous for his noble
<>qualities and unique prowess. He possessed three bodies,
<>which possessed capacity to rule the country. One of
<>the three bodies was the best, the other midway between
<>good and bad and the third bad. The very origin of
<>the King was in the wide and extensive sky; like birds
<>he lived in the sky. He built a city in the sky with
<>fourteen streets and three divisions or sectors. There
<>were also forests, woods and mountains for games in
<>the city; seven big tanks, wavy-white with creepers of
<>pearl and two lamps, spreading heat and coolness,
<>burning always. The King, who went about all his time
<>in this vast city, built in it many movable inner dwell-
<>ings, and they were divided between the upper and
<>lower parts of the city. They were thatched with a
<>kind of black grass. Each inner house had nine doors,
<>some of them windows, which admitted air always. In
<>each house five lamps burned, the lamps resting on three
<>pillars and a white piece of wood. Each house was
<>glitteringly plastered and had courtyards. A particular
<>sect of bhu1tas, who ever feared light, guarded the
<>houses. When the houses created thus by magic moved
<>from one place to another, King Svottha enjoyed, like
<>birds in nests, playing various games therein. The
<>king, who possessed three bodies, used to go out
<>after playing for some time with the guards, and run
<>about like one possessed of a desire to occupy houses,
<>newly built, and then reach the city, which was like a
<>Gandharva city. Frail and unsettled in mind, the king,
<>off and on, developed a will to die, and accordingly he
<>died. Just as waves come up in the sea, the king used
<>to be born again from the sky and to attend to worldly
<>affairs. At times he used to repent about and weep over
<>his actions asking himself what he, the fool, was doing
<>and why he should be sad like that. At other times he
<>used to feel elated and enthusiastic. Briefly put, he
<>used to be, by turns drinking, walking, jumping, expand-
<>ing, contracting, feeling, drowsy and then exuberant.
<>The great and handsome king was actually, like the
<>sea, rendered restless by wind, possessed by various
<>moods.
<NI>The father was describing a philosophy of life figuratively
<>to his son, but the boy understood nothing. Then, as [Page693-b+ 65]
<>requested by the son, the father explained to him the
<>meaning of the story as follows:
<NI>Svottha was concretised conception born out of the
<>ultimate sky. Conceptions originate and die automatic-
<>ally. The whole visible world is imaginary. The world
<>is there only when there is conception and in its absence
<>no world exists. Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and Indra are
<>only parts of that conception. It is conception itself,
<>which creates the world of three cities in nothingness or
<>vacuum. On account of the blessing (will) of that
<>fundamental Caitanya (awareness, life) the formless con-
<>ception attains Brahmanhood (the universal self) and
<>engages itself in the process of creation. The glittering
<>city said to have been created in the sky is the fourteen
<>worlds, the gardens in it are forests and woods, the play
<>hills therein are mountains like the Hima1layas, Meru
<>etc. The two eternal lamps of heat and cold of the
<>story refer to the Sun and Moon. The creepers or
<>garlands of pearl refer to rivers. Special gems have
<>been described as tendrils of lotus and fire in the ocean
<>and the seven seas are described respectively as lotus and
<>the seven tanks. The statement that in this three-tiered
<>city the king of conception built play-houses referred to
<>the creation of individual bodies. The houses were con-
<>nected as those in the upper, middle and lower parts
<>to denote living beings in the three worlds, Deva-
<>loka, Manus2yaloka and Pa1ta1la. Movement is the
<>journey of bodies due to the flow of Pra1n2a (breath).
<>Pieces of wood refer to bones and the plastering is skin.
<>Black grass said to have been used for thatching is hair
<>on the head. The nine doors are the nine openings in
<>the body. Windows refer to the ear, nose etc. The
<>hand arms etc. are roads and the five sense organs,
<>lamps. The guards, who shun and quit light, are the
<>egoes which run away from knowledge and discretion.
<>The king of conception or imagination born from non-
<>materials finds enjoyment in the house of the body,
<>but the enjoyment is only ephemeral. Imagination
<>develops a moment and is extinguished, like the lamp,
<>the next moment. The place or status of conceptions
<>in the body may be compared to that of waves in the
<>ocean. When desire takes place for things conceived it
<>returns to the ‘body-house,’ which is to be born, and it
<>ends or perishes on achievement. Rebirth due to desire
<>(will-power) is never for happiness, but is for unending
<>sorrow and pain. The wide world causes sorrow be-
<>cause it is felt to be real. Absence of this feeling ends
<>the sorrow as night swallows clouds. Lamentation is
<>the appeal or expression of the mind remembering for-
<>bidden practices in life and a1nanda happiness, is the
<>proud state of mind remembering noble practices.
<>The three bodies of the king according to the three
<>states-the best or highest, the middle one and the low-
<>denote the three attributes (Sattva rajas-tamo gun2as)
<>Causative of the existence of the world. The lowest
<>of the attributes (tamogun2a) or conceptions according
<>to them, getting more and more pain-giving on account
<>of uncultured action lead one to lower forms of life like
<>the worm, tree, grass etc. Conception of real knowledge
<>and truth is realisation of duty, righteousness and
<>wisdom. It is next to the state of salvation called
<>Deves4vara state. Ra1jasa (the middle attribute) gun2a
<>functions as material activities in the form of attachment
<>to wife, son, wealth etc. When one has rejected the
<>forms of gun2as (conceptions) and the very conception [Page694-a+ 65]
<>is thus annihilated, one attains the supreme state.
<>Therefore, Oh! son! you reject all external perceptions,
<>control the mind by itself and completely annihilate all
<>internal and external conceptions. Whether you live in
<>heaven, on earth or in pa1ta1la and do intense tapas for
<>thousands of years, unless conception is eliminated you
<>will not attain salvation.
<NI>After hearing the above explanation about the illusions
<>in life, from his hiding place Vasis2t2ha went away.

<HI>SA1RASVATA I. See under Apa1ntaratamas.
<HI>SA1RASVATA II. An ancient hermit. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 7,
<>that Sa1rasvata was the son of Dadhi1ca. Dadhi1ca once
<>happened to see the celestial maid Alambus2a1 and
<>became excited, and seminal discharge occurred to him.
<>The semen fell in the river Sarasvati1. The river became
<>pregnant and delivered a child. This child grew up
<>and became the famous hermit named Sa1rasvata.
<NI>After the death of the hermit Dadhi1ci, due to scarcity
<>of rain a great famine occurred which lasted for twelve
<>years. When the famine became unbearable all the
<>hermits on the basin and banks of the river Sarasvati1
<>began to migrate to other places leaving all their
<>possessions behind, to save their lives. But Sa1rasvata
<>alone remained on the banks of Sarasvati1, living on
<>fish obtained from the river, engaged in meditation
<>and study of Vedas.
<NI>After twelve years the famine ended and the country
<>became prosperous as before. The hermits who had gone
<>to other places began to come back to their hermitages.
<>The desire to study Vedas grew up in their minds.
<>But there was not a single person, well-versed in the
<>Vedas, except Sa1rasvata. So all the hermits accepted
<>him as their teacher. Thus Sa1rasvata taught the Vedas
<>to Sixtythousand hermits, who had returned to their
<>hermitages. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 50).
<NI>In course of time the place where the hermitage of
<>Sa1rasvata stood, became famous under the name
<>Sa1rasvata ti1rtha. Tun3gaka1ran2ya is another name of
<>this place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verses
<>43-50).
<NI>In ancient days there were two schemes of study known
<>as ‘Ka1n2d2a1nukramapa1t2ha’ and ‘Sa1rasvatapa1t2ha’ for the
<>Taittiri1ya-collection (Sam3hita1). But today the
<>Ka1n2d2a1nukramapa1t2ha has become quite extinct. The
<>following is a description, given in S4am3ska1raratnama1la1
<>stating how the ‘Sa1rasvatapa1t2ha’ attained so vigorous a
<>vogue.
<NI>Once owing to the curse of the hermit Durva1sas, the
<>river Sarasvati1 took birth as a woman in the house of
<>a Brahmin, who belonged to the Gotra of A1treya.
<>Later from that same Brahmin she conceived and gave
<>birth to a son named Sa1rasvata. The river Sarasvati1
<>herself, taught her son the Vedas completely, and then [Page695-a+ 64]
<>sent him to Kuruks2etra to do penance. As a result
<>of the penance Sa1rasvata got an original Kramapa1t2ha
<>(serial lessons) of the Taittiri1ya sam3hita1. He taught
<>those serial lessons to his disciples. In course of time
<>these serial lessons got the name Sa1rasvatapa1t2ha.
<>which earned metaphysical and philosophical import-
<>ance.
<HI>SA1RASVATA III. A hermit who lived in the western
<>regions. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 201, Verse 30, that this Sa1rasvata was the son
<>of the hermit Atri.
<HI>SA1RASVATA IV. Mention is made in Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Svargakhan2d2a, about another hermit Sa1rasvata, who
<>taught the Vedas to several disciples in Tun3gaka1ran2ya.
<HI>SA1RASVATA V. The people who lived in a particular
<>region of Western Bha1rata. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 9).
<HI>SARASVATI1 I. Goddess of learning.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Sarasvati is the daughter of Brahma1.
<>Ka1madeva was born from Brahma1's heart; Krodha
<>(anger) was born from his eyebrows; Lobha, from his
<>lower lip, Sarasvati1, from his face; the Sindhus from
<>his genitals, and Nirr2ti, from his anus.
<NI>The following story about the birth of Sarasvati1 is
<>from Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 43:--
<NI>Brahma1 got ready for creation, and while in meditation
<>sattvagun2a (sublime quality) began swelling up in his
<>mind wherefrom a girl was born. Brahma1 asked her
<>who she was. She answered: “I am born from you.
<>You fix for me a seat and duties.” Then Brahma1 told
<>her that her name was Sarasvati1 and ordained that she
<>should stay on the tip of everybody's tongue. You
<>dance especially on the tongues of learned people. You
<>should also exist on earth in the form of a river, and
<>assuming a third form you should live in me too.”
<>Sarasvati1 agreed to this.
<NI>2) {%Curse of Sarasvati1.%} See under Gan3ga1.
<NI>3) {%Misled Kumbhakarn2a.%} When Kumbhakarn2a requested
<>Brahma1 for a boon, Sarasvati1, at the instance of the
<>latter, lodged herself in the tongue of Kumbhakarn2a and
<>made him ask for Nidra1vatva (Sleep), something dif-
<>ferent from what he really desired to get Viz. Nir-
<>devatva (absence of Devas).
<NI>4) {%Received Bad2ava1gni.%} (all-consuming fire). Bad2ava1gni
<>was born at the quarrel between the Bha1rgavas and
<>Hehayas. Bad2ava1gni is flames of Aurva, the Bha1rgava.
<>(See under Aurva). It was Sarasvati1 who took the
<>Agni to the ocean. As a result of this, Sarasvati1, be-
<>came a river in India. The story is told in the Sr2s2t2i-
<>khan2d2a of Padma Pura1n2a as follows:-
<NI>The world was about to be burnt in Bad2ava1gni, which
<>originated from Aurva, when Indra requested Sarasvati1
<>thus: “Oh! Devi! you should deposit this agni in the
<>western ocean; or else the world will be consumed in
<>its flames.” To this Sarasvati1 told Vis2n2u as follows:
<>“I am not a free person. I will do nothing without the
<>permission of my father. Therefore, please think
<>of some other means.”
<NI>The Devas, who understood Sarasvati1's nature, went
<>to Brahma1 with their case. Immediately he called
<>Sarasvati1 to him and asked her to deposit Bad2ava1gni
<>in the western ocean for the safety of himself and the
<>Devas. Unable to disobey her father, Sarasvati1, with
<>tears in her eyes, agreed to do so. Then Gan3ga1 followed
<>her and she told the former that she (Gan3ga1) would [Page695-b+ 65]
<>see her flowing northwards when she reached the eastern
<>region surrounded by Devas.
<NI>Sarasvati1 sent back her companions like Gan3ga1, Yamuna1
<>Manorama1, Ga1yatri1 and Sa1vitri1 who followed her. Then
<>she appeared at the a1s4rama of Uttan3ka under the
<>Plaks2a tree in the presence of the Devas. Just as S4iva
<>carried Gan3ga1, the Plaks2a tree bore Sarasvati1 and
<>immediately did S4iva give to her Bad2ava1gni in a pot.
<>Because of his blessing the agni did not burn her hands.
<>She went towards the north with the pot and came
<>to Pus2karin2i1, and she stopped there to redeem the
<>sins of people. It is believed to this very day that those
<>who drink water from the Pus2kara will attain Brahma-
<>loka.
<NI>From Pus2kara Sarasvati1 flowed towards the west and
<>reaching a date-garden not far off from Pus2kara it rose
<>up again where Sarasvati1 is known as Nanda1 as well.
<>There is also another reason for the name Nanda1.
<>Once upon a time there was a King called Prabhan5jana.
<>While hunting in the forest he saw a deer inside a
<>cluster of shrubs and he shot an arrow at it. Then the
<>deer told the King: “What a crime is this! You have
<>wounded me, who am feeding my child. I have heard
<>that the King shall not kill a deer while it is engaged
<>in drinking, sleeping or mating. May you, who have done
<>this cruel act, be transformed into a tiger and roam
<>about this thorny forest.” Saying again and again
<>that he did not notice that the deer was feeding its
<>child, the King begged for absolution from the curse.
<>Taking pity on the weeping king the deer told him that
<>he would be redeemed from the curse when he had
<>talked with the cow called Nanda1, which would go there
<>after a hundred years.
<NI>According to the above curse the king got transformed
<>into a tiger and spent hundred years eating wild
<>animals. After hundred years were over a herd of cows
<>came there grazing under the leadership of a cow called
<>Nanda1. Beautiful Nanda1 used to walk ahead of the
<>other cows and graze alone at a secret place in the
<>forest. There was a mountain called Rohita there, on
<>the banks of the river. The northern side of the mountain
<>was a dense forest infested by cruel animals. There
<>lived there a very cruel and terrible tiger as big as a
<>mountain. A generous person called Nanda was feed-
<>ing the cows with grass etc. Nanda1, the cow, got separ-
<>ated from the herd and came to the river when the
<>tiger ran after it asking it to stop. Crying aloud the
<>cow said: Oh tiger; I have a child, which has not
<>begun even tasting grass and it is awaiting the return of
<>its mother to the cow-shed at dusk. I shall go and take
<>leave of the child and return so that you may eat me.”
<NI>Taking pity on the cow the tiger granted its prayer. It
<>returned duly to the tiger at dusk. The tiger, taken by
<>surprise, by the honesty of the cow enquired of it its
<>name, and the cow answered that it was named Nanda1
<>by its master, Nanda. As soon as the name was uttered
<>Prabhan5jana was released from his old curse and he
<>became the former king. Dharmadeva then appeared
<>there and asked her to choose the boon she liked and
<>she replied as follows:--“I, with my child, must attain
<>the ultimate place and position, and let this place
<>become a sacred place for munis. Also, let this river
<>Sarasvati1, come to be known as Nanda1, by my name.”
<NI>Nanda1 immediately ascended to heaven and Prabhan5-
<>jana returned to his palace. River Sarasvati1 came to be [Page696-a+ 65]
<>called Nanda1 from that day: After flowing through the
<>above-mentioned date-garden towards the south for some
<>distance Sarasvati1 (Nanda1) flowed again towards the
<>north. She reached the ocean and deposited therein the
<>pot of Bad2ava1gni. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2ikhan2d2a).
<NI>5) {%Sarasvati1 as Brahma1's wife.%} The Pura1n2as mention
<>three wives of Brahma1, Sarasvati1, Sa1vitri1 and Ga1yatri1.
<>But, the three are, according to Matsya Pura1n2a, one
<>and the same person. The Matsya Pura1n2a mentions:--
<>Brahma1 created, from his own effulgence, a woman,
<>who became famous under the names S4ataru1pa1, Sa1vitri1,
<>Ga1yatri1 and Brahma1n2i1. Brahma1 fell in love with his
<>daughter and noticing the fact she turned away to the right
<>side of her father. Then did a face appear on his right
<>side. To avoid the amorous looks of the father, she
<>slided off to both his sides, and faces appeared on those
<>sides of Brahma1. Then Sarasvati1 jumped up to the sky
<>and a fifth face appeared on his head, turned upwards.
<>Finding escape impossible she yielded to the desire of
<>Brahma1 and they enjoyed honey-moon for a hundred
<>years. To them was born a son called Sva1yambhuva or
<>Vira1t2.
<NI>At one place in Skanda Pura1n2a, Sa1vitri1 and Ga1yatri1
<>are referred to as different individuals. (See under
<>Sa1vitri1).
<NI>6) {%Idol of Sarasvati1.%} Sarasvati1, clad in white clothes,
<>sits on a white lotus. She holds in her hands a string of
<>beads, book and Vi1n2a1. She is depicted in sitting, stand-
<>ing and dancing postures. She is conceived as S4akti
<>related to Vis2n2u as also to S4iva. In certain old works
<>in Bengal, Sarasvati1, instead of Bhu1midevi1, is to be seen
<>along with Vis2n2u. Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 50, enjoins
<>that idols of Sarasvati1 in temple should hold in its
<>hands book, string of beads and Vi1n2a1.

<>Tiger, leopard etc. were born from S4a1rdu1li1. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>SARGA (CREATION). Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20
<>refers to various sargas as follows.
<NI>The first creation is that of greatness (Mahatva) i e.
<>Brahma1. The second creation is that of tanma1tras
<>called bhu1tasarga. The third is Vaika1rikasarga also
<>called Aindriyikasarga. These three kinds of creation
<>are called Pra1kr2ta sr2s2t2i (natural creation) and that is
<>conscious and intelligent creation. The fourth is
<>mukhyasarga. Mukhyas mean immovables. The fifth
<>is tiryagyonisr2s2t2i. Since it functions side-long it is
<>called tiryaksrotas. The sixth is the creation of U1rdhva-
<>srotas, called devasarga. The seventh is the creation
<>of arva1ksrotas, called ma1nus2asarga. The eighth,
<>anugrahasarga, is both sa1ttvic and ta1masic. Thus,
<>vaikr2tasargas are five in number and pra1kr2tasargas
<>three. The ninth sarga is the Kauma1ra sarga, which
<>is both vaikr2ta and Pra1kr2ta. The fundamental or
<>root cause of the universe is the above nine creations

<>(eternal), naimittika (casual) and dainandina (daily).
<>Nityasarga is the creation after interim deluges.
<HI>SARIDDVI1PA. One of the prominent sons of Garud2a
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101).
<HI>SA1RIKA. A hermit who was a prominent member of
<>the council of Yudhisthira. Mention is made about [Page697-b+ 63]
<>him in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse
<>13.
<HI>SA1RIMEJAYA. A King in ancient India. It is mention-
<>ed in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 19,
<>that this King was present at the Svayam3vara
<>(marriage) of Draupadi1.
<HI>S4ARI1RA. (BODY). Body is constituted of the five
<>elements, earth, water, fire, air and sky (ether). What
<>is solid or hard in the body is earth; liquid, is water;
<>hot or burning, fire; what gives motion to the body is
<>air and what are pores in the body is sky.
<NI>Body is that which exists and functions with the five
<>organs of knowledge eye, ear, nose, tongue and skin,
<>and the five organs of action like Upastha (sex organ),
<>Pa1n2i (hand), Pa1da (leg) and Va1n2i1 (speech). The body
<>depends on the six tastes, sweet, sour, saltish, bitter,
<>hot and astringent. (Kat2u, amla, madhura, lavan2a,
<>tikta and kas2a1ya). The body is composed of seven
<>internal elements (dha1tus) of seven colours, white, red,
<>dark (black), black and white, yellow, brassy and
<>faint-white (Pa1n2d2ura). Va1tapittakaphas (wind, bile
<>and phlegm) are intertwined in the body. Since the
<>body is formed of vital fluids from the sex organs of
<>the father and the mother it is dviyoni (males with male
<>and females with female organs of reproduction). The
<>body exists by four kinds of foods, bhojya, bhaks2ya, kha1-
<>dya and lehya. After coitus, within one night, the male
<>and female semen and blood combine into one body in
<>the womb (Kalala). Within seven days it becomes foamy
<>(budbuda). After a fortnight it becomes solid (pin2d2a)
<>and after one month hard (kat2hina). During the
<>second month the head of the child is formed; in the
<>third month its feet: in the fourth its ankles, stomach
<>and waist are formed. In the fifth month is formed
<>the back (Pr2s2t2ha) and face, nose, eyes and ears are
<>formed in the sixth month. During the seventh month
<>life enters the child's body. By the eighth month all the
<>signs of the human being are completed in the child.
<>If the vitality and effulgence of the mother are more
<>than those of the father the off-spring will be female
<>and vice versa; if both are in exactly equal proportions
<>the child will be a eunuch, neither male nor female. If
<>the parents were sad and worried during the time of
<>the mother's conception, the child born would be either
<>blind, lame or a pigmy. If the semen is cleft into two
<>by wind (in the womb) the mother would give birth to
<>twins. In the ninth month the child will be gifted
<>with knowledge and it will remember to what caste it
<>belonged and what all good and evil actions it did in
<>its previous life.

<HI>S4A1RN3GA. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's bow. The following facts about
<>the bow are gathered from the Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>(i) When Kr2s2n2a exhibited his Vis4varu1pa (cosmic form)
<>in the assembly of the Kauravas he had held in one
<>hand this bow. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 131, Verse 10).
<NI>(ii) Kr2s2n2a's S4a1rn3ga is on a par with Indra's bow called
<>Vijaya. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 158, Verse 4).

<HI>SARPA. A son of Tvas2t2a1. According to Agni Pura1n2a
<>the sons of Tvas2t2a1 were called Eka1das4arudras; But
<>according to Maha1bha1rata, Sarpa, one of the Eka1das4a-
<>rudras is the son of Stha1n2u and the great-grandson of
<>Brahma1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Verse 2).
<HI>SARPABALI. An offering made by Hindus in South
<>India to propitiate serpents. Serpents are pleased by
<>songs by Pulluvan and Pulluvatti (Male and female
<>members of a Hindu sub-caste). To draw Kalams
<>(drawings on floor conveying certain esoteric meanings),
<>to make offerings and for the Pulluvars to sing--these
<>form important elements of Sarpabali. The bali has
<>a connection with the story of Kha1n2d2avada1ha. The
<>legend behind the bali is that a Pulluva woman saved
<>Taks2aka, who escaped to the ocean after the Kha1n2d2ava
<>forest was burnt down. Songs by Pulluvan and Pullu-
<>vatti are unavoidable items in Sarpabali.
<NI>Drawing the Kalam is a very important item in Sarpa-
<>bali. It is drawn on a platform made of put2t2uman2n2u
<>(small heaps of earth thrown up by earthworms and ter-
<>mites), the platform being demarcated by four pieces
<>of arecanut wood. The platform is covered with silk
<>and tender coconut leaves are hung all around it. The
<>Kalam is drawn with rice powder, and other coloured
<>powders. The husk of paddy burnt into charcoal is
<>powdered and with it serpents are sketched first on the
<>man2d2apa (platform). The na1ga drawings are tinted
<>with colours. The (colour) powders are collected in
<>coconut shells and sprinkled on the drawings through
<>holes in shells. Pulluvas exhibit wonderful artistic talents
<>in making the drawings.
<NI>When the kalam is drawn worship of na1ga is begun
<>compulsorily by a male member of the house, and he is
<>technically called ‘Kalattil Kaimal’. He has been observ-
<>ing ‘vrata’ during two days previous to the pu1ja1
<>(worship). Having taken his bath and wearing an
<>additional cloth across his shoulders (Uttari1ya) he
<>comes with water in a jar. Four lamps should be burn-
<>ing on four sides of the kalam. Also, paddy, rice,
<>tender coconut, milk, fruit etc. should be placed on its
<>four sides. As directed by the Pulluvan the ‘Kaimal’
<>conducts the worship by offering flower, water etc. The
<>Kaimal is to sit on each of the four sides of the kalam
<>and do the pu1ja1. Then wicks (made of cloth) should
<>be lighted, water sprinkled on it and with that the
<>Kaimal should go around the kalam thrice. With the
<>wicks placed on a leaf with paddy underneath it and
<>also with burning camphor he should go round the [Page698-b+ 65]
<>kalam. Then the Pulluvan playing on the Vi1n2a1 in front
<>and a male member of the house with a vessel contain-
<>ing milk, a female member holding a lamp, two girls
<>holding brass plates and the Kaimal and all of them
<>following the Pulluvan go round the Kalam thrice and
<>proceed to the serpents' temple in the compound, pray
<>and return. After all these persons are seated, the
<>Kaimal washes the feet of and puts flowers on the heads
<>of the two girls, who had held the brass plates; seats
<>them on two pieces of round wood in the kalam. The
<>girls will have mirror etc. in their hands. They should
<>concentrate their eyes on the heads of the serpents. Now
<>begins the Pulluvan pa1t2t2u (song by Pulluvan). At the
<>time of the worship they will be beating tunes on a brass
<>pot, music being made on the Vi1n2a1.
<NI>‘Pulluvan pa1t2t2u’ is the most important item in the whole
<>programme. The songs relate to the burning of the
<>kha1n2d2ava forest, Ka1liyamardana (suppression of the
<>na1ga king) etc. One Pulluvan sings songs and a second
<>one repeats them. A minimum of two Pulluva males
<>and two females are required for the purpose. As the
<>songs acquire momentum the girls begin to shake their
<>heads and to wipe off the kalam. Then the girls are
<>asked questions and they answer. Within a short time
<>the girls will swoon and fall on the ground. They are
<>brought back to consciousness by water being sprinkled
<>on them and by fanning. This is in general the nature
<>of a Sarpabali.
<HI>SARPADEVI1. Sarpadevi1, also called na1gati1rtha, is a

<HI>S4AS4IKALA1. Daughter of Suba1hu, King of Ka1s4i1. She
<>was married by a prince Sudars4ana who had been
<>driven out of his kingdom by Yudha1jit.
<NI>As she became a young woman S4as4ikala1 heard about
<>Sudars4ana, who lived in the forest with his mother and
<>fell in love with him. One night Devi1 appeared in
<>dream to her and told her that marriage with Sudars4ana
<>would take place, and at those words of Devi1 she
<>awoke from sleep and began laughing. Though her
<>mother asked S4as4ikala1 about the reason for her laugh-
<>ing thus, she answered not, but continued laughing.
<>One day while she was picnicking in the Campaka
<>forest, an old brahmin came there and described to
<>her about the great personality and beauty of Sudar-
<>s4ana, who then was staying with his mother at
<>Bharadva1ja1s4rama. S4as4ikala1's heart yearned to be with
<>Sudars4ana.
<NI>Sudars4ana, after the death of his father Dhruvasandhi,
<>lived with his mother Manorama1 and her father. But,
<>Yudha1jit killed Manorama1's mother also. It was after
<>this that Sudars4ana and his mother took refuge in the
<>a1s4rama of Bharadva1jamuni. One of those days, Nis2a1da,
<>King of S4r2n3giverapura and a friend of Sudars4ana's
<>father (Dhruvasandhi) came to Bharadva1ja1s4rama and
<>presented a chariot, which possessed mysterious powers,
<>to Sudars4ana. The munis were pleased at this and
<>imparted to Sudars4ana the Ka1mara1jamantra, which gave
<>one who practised it all that one desired, and after the
<>above incident Sudars4ana began slowly to come out of
<>the a1s4rama. He went about the forests in the chariot
<>presented by Nis2a1da, and he was astonished to find
<>many an armed soldier surround him wherever he
<>went. This happened because of the mysterious powers
<>of the chariot.
<NI>It was at this time that King Suba1hu decided to con-
<>duct the Svayam3vara of his daughter S4as4ikala1. Kings
<>from all lands came. S4as4ikala1 told her mother in secret
<>about her desire to marry Sudars4ana, and the mother
<>in turn told about this to the father. But, he was not
<>for it. Then S4as4ikala1 sent a messenger secretly to
<>Sudar ana to request him to be present at the
<>Svayam3vara, and Sudars4ana and his mother started for
<>the palace of the King of Ka1s4i1 and when they reached
<>it, kings like Yudha1jit had already come there. A
<>rumour was spread that Suba1hu, insultingly ignoring
<>all the crowned heads, was going to marry his daughter [Page700-a+ 64]
<>to Sudars4ana, a mere beggar. The assembled Kings,
<>therefore, got themselves ready to pick a row with
<>Suba1hu, but, he pacified them with the assurance that
<>the Svayam3vara of S4as4ikala1 would formally be conduct-
<>ed and her husband could then be selected by herself.
<>That night S4as4ikala1's parents tried their best to divert
<>her heart away from Sudars4ana, to no purpose and the
<>same night she was duly married to him. By the next
<>morning news about the marriage became public and
<>all the Kings, who had come for the Svayam3vara
<>decided in conference to kill Sudars4ana on his way back
<>home with his wife, and abduct S4as4ikala1. Accordingly
<>on the fourth day after the wedding when Sudars4ana
<>and S4as4ikala1 were returning to Ayodhya1 escorted by
<>the army allotted to them by Suba1hu, King Yudha1jit
<>and his followers attacked them from their hiding place.
<>In the battle that ensued Devi1 appeared and helped
<>Sudars4ana, who defeated the enemies. People of
<>Ayodhya1 received with enthusiasm the victorious Sudar-
<>s4ana and he was crowned their King. In later years he
<>became famous as emperor Sudars4ana.

<>occurs in the 8th Skandha of Bha1gavata and the Asura

<NI>Though Priyavrata, son of Sva1yambhuva Manu was at
<>first averse to marriage he, at last, married, on the

<>year. But, the child was still-born and Priyavrata set out
<>with the corpse for the burning ghat. But, he could
<>not make up his mind to give it up and so decided
<>himself also to court death. Then he saw a divine plane
<>stop there with a woman in it, who spoke to him as

<HI>S4ATARUDRA. The story of S4atarudra was imparted
<>to S4ri1 Ra1ma by Vya1sa to show that all life is mere
<>illusion or different complexes of the mind. S4ataru-
<>dropa1khya1na is the story of a contemplative sannya1sin.
<>Whatever subject or object he conceived in his mind
<>used to assume its form as water changes into waves,
<>and it was a boon or great asset, which his heart had
<>acquired as a result of its purity. He confined himself
<>to his a1s4rama and thought about things one after the
<>other.
<NI>To start with, S4atarudra thought to himself that he
<>was a ‘dream person’ called Ji1vat2a. While picnicking
<>in the streets of a ‘dream-built city’ the ‘dream person’
<>overcome by the effect of liquor remained in an
<>unconscious state for some time. He also felt imme-
<>diately to be a brahmin learned in the Vedas. ‘Ji1vat2a’,
<>who transformed himself thus into a brahmin slept
<>during day-time overcome by exhaustion on account
<>of work. At once he dreamt himself to have been
<>transformed into a feudal lord or tributary King, who,
<>after taking his meals went to sleep when he dreamt
<>that he was changed into a great King. The King,
<>who ruled the country peacefully changed himself one
<>day in dream into a celestial woman. The next dream
<>was that the woman, while in deep sleep after a
<>hilarious sexual act, was turned into a she-deer. The
<>she-deer, in dream turned into a creeper, and it duly
<>bore leaves, flowers and fruits. The creeper felt that it [Page702-a+ 64]
<>entwined and climbed some trees. Then he (Ji1vat2a)
<>went into deep sleep, absolutely unaware of himself,
<>for some time. Then he dreamt himself to have chang-
<>ed into a beetle. The beetle felt attracted towards a
<>lotus flower and got captured therein. An elephant
<>from the forest nearby entered the ‘lotus pond’, plucked
<>and tore into pieces the lotus flower. As the beetle had
<>got fixed in its mind and imagination the picture of
<>the elephant it became a tusker elephant after its death.
<>While roaming about in the forest the elephant fell
<>into a deep pit and the King's men captured and listed
<>it in the army. A number of beetles gathered round
<>the elephant to suck its ichor (madajala). Because
<>it thought about the beetles the elephant, after its
<>death in battle, again became a beetle, which imagined
<>about the swan in the lotus-pond. The beetle one day
<>got captured in the lotus-flower and became a swan on
<>being killed by the elephant. Thus the beetle, after
<>taking many births and forms, became ultimately
<>Brahma1's vehicle, the swan. While the swan once
<>moved about the surrounding places of mount Kaila1sa
<>it saw Rudra and imagining itself to be Rudra
<>(Rudroham--I am Rudra) attained Rudrahood.
<>While living happily with all the parapher-
<>nalia of Rudra he remembered his past lives, and
<>wondering about the many continuous dreams of his,
<>in solitude he thought like this:--“The power of
<>Ma1ya1 (illusion) which rules over everything in the
<>world is really wonderful. How curious and peculiar
<>is the cunningness or trickeries of Ma1ya1 in creating,
<>like mirage, the illusion that things, which did not
<>really exist, existed. Mistaking Ma1ya1 or mirage as the
<>truth and the fact, I roamed about in many a material
<>desert. In one form of life I was born as Ji1vat2a, in
<>another, King: in yet another, swan etc. and now I
<>have attained Rudra-hood. Hundred Caturyugas and
<>thousand years have passed in this ‘show” Now, I
<>will return and personally see all past episodes and I
<>shall identify them all with myself after bestowing
<>knowledge on them.
<NI>Having made up his mind like this, Rudra descended
<>to the state of the old Sannya1sin. He infused life and
<>vitality into the dead body of the sannya1sin that was
<>there. The Sannya1sin remembered his old illusions
<>and hallucinations. He had attained Rudrahood after
<>crossing various stages from being Ji1vat2a. Then both
<>of them together came to the Ji1vat2a stage, awoke the
<>‘dream-person’ by giving him mind and vitality. After-
<>wards the three of them, who assumed single form by
<>the composition of different personalities, attained
<>various stages like brahmin etc., awoke them too and
<>added them to themselves (the three). Thus there came
<>about to be hundred persons formed from aspects or
<>fractions of Rudra, and at the instance of the real
<>Rudra they returned to their homes and lived there
<>happily with their sons, relations etc. Those hundred
<>persons are the S4atarudras. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha, S4atarudro-
<>pa1khya1na). In Verse 13, Chapter 150 of Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Maha1bha1rata also is found references to the
<>S4atarudras.
<HI>S4ATARU1PA1. Wife of Sva1yambhuva Manu, who took
<>his sister S4ataru1pa1 herself as his wife. The couple had

<NI>It was Bharata, who led the ya1jn5ic horse towards the
<>north in connection with the As4vamedha yajn5a perform-
<>ed by S4ri1 Ra1ma after he was crowned King. The
<>horse, which started on its journey from Ayodhya1
<>reached, after six months, Hemaku1t2a on the limits of
<>India. As soon as it got into a beautiful garden it was
<>rendered stationary as though paralysed. All attempts to
<>make the horse move failed. S4atrughna and some sol-
<>diers tried to lift the horse by its legs, to no purpose.
<>Hanu1ma1n bound its legs with his tail and pulled, again
<>to no purpose, and surprised at this failure of his he
<>spoke to S4atrughna and others thus. “It was only just
<>now that I pulled out with my tail the Dron2a mountain
<>so very easily; but this small horse does not stir at all.
<>May be, it is all fate.” Following Hanu1ma1n's speech,
<>S4atrughna asked Suma1li1 the explanation for this state of
<>the matter, but the latter could not find one for it. Then
<>it was decided to find out a mahars2i and ask him for
<>the explanation. The soldiers accompanied by Bharata
<>went in search of a mahars2i, reached S4aunaka's a1s4rama
<>and submitted the case to him.
<NI>The mahars2i remained in meditation for some time and
<>the condition of the horse became vivid in his mind.
<>Then he spoke as follows:--“There was once a brahmin
<>named Sa1tvika in Gaud2a(?) land on the banks of river
<>Ka1veri1. Once he began performing tapas. He spent
<>three days. drinking only water the first day, consuming
<>air the next day and fasting completely the third day.
<>He continued his tapas repeating the above course until
<>one day he entered sama1dhi (expired). He got into
<>a decorated plane sent from Devaloka, went to the peak
<>of mount Meru and thence came to river Jambu1, which
<>flowed from the great Jambu1 tree on the mountain.
<>There in Jambu1 were many mahars2is, who had acquired
<>merit by bathing in the golden water of the river, en-
<>joying all comforts in the company of apsara1 women.
<>Sa1tvika, one day, haughty with the thought that he was

<>displeased the latter, and they cursed him. When he
<>prayed for absolution from the curse they told him thus:
<>“When you paralyse the feet of S4ri1 Ra1ma's horse, you
<>will happen to hear Ra1ma's story and then you will be
<>redeemed from curse.”
<NI>On S4aunaka informing them thus that it was the
<>brahmin transformed into a Ra1ks2asa, who had para-
<>lysed the legs of the horse, Bharata returned to the
<>horse and recited the story of Ra1ma and immediately an
<>effulgent person came there in a plane and said, “Oh.
<>intelligent King! I have now heard the story of Ra1ma
<>and so have become pure; so, please let me go to
<>heaven.” After saying this he returned. Bharata and
<>others were pleased to know that the visitor was Sa1tvika
<>brahmin. The horse became free from its paralysed
<>condition. The party resumed its journey. (Padma

<HI>SATYA II. An Agni (fire). This Agni Satya was the son
<>of the Agni Nis4cyavana. He was a worker of Ka1la-
<>dharma (The god of Death). He reduces the pain of
<>living beings who are suffering. So this Agni Satya
<>got the name Nis2kr2ti also. This Agni brightens the [Page704-a+ 65]
<>houses and gardens where people stay. It is stated in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Verse 13,
<>that this Agni had a son named Svana.
<HI>SATYA III. A warrior who served in the army of the
<>King of Kalin3ga. This warrior fought against the

<HI>SATYA IV. A hermit in the country of Vidarbha, This
<>hermit who was a brahmin was a believer in ahim3sa1 also.
<>Once he performed a sacrifice without any killing. His

<>deva came there in the form of an antelope to test the
<>non-killing principle of Satya. The animal came near
<>Satya and said: “I am a deva (god) belonging to the
<>S4ukra-clan. I dwell in this forest as an antelope, due
<>to the curse of Dharmadeva. Kill me and complete
<>this sacrifice.”
<NI>Though Satya heard this, he did not wish to kill the
<>animal. At last the antelope decided to go and walked
<>eight steps and then returned. Due to the delusive
<>arts of the antelope Satya saw there celestial maids
<>and the aeroplanes of Gandharvas. The antelope said
<>that if he was killed he would attain heaven. A desire
<>arose in Satya for killing and forthwith he lost all the
<>attainments he got by penance. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva.
<>Chapter 272).
<HI>SATYA V. Another name of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B. S4a1nti

<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Verse 4).
<HI>SATYA(S). A group of Devas (gods). This group of
<>devas lived in the third Manvantara. The name of the
<>then Manu was Uttama and the King of the devas was
<>the Indra Sus4a1nti. There were then five Devagan2as
<>(groups of Gods) each consisting of twelve devas.
<>Those gan2as were Sudha1ma1s, Satyas, Japas, Pratarda-
<>nas and Vas4avartis. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3, Chapter

<HI>SATYABHA1MA1. The wife of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>1) {%Introduction.%} Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a himself said about the
<>previous birth of Satyabha1ma1. There was an occasion
<>for saying that.
<NI>Once Na1rada came from the world of the gods to
<>Dva1raka1. He had brought with him some flowers of
<>the Kalpaka tree. Na1rada gave all those flowers to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a divided them among his wives,
<>but he had forgotten Satyabha1ma1. Being unable to
<>subdue her sorrow and anger she got into her bedroom
<>and wept and sighed and lay there. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to
<>know of this. He took Satyabha1ma1 with him on the
<>back of Garud2a and went to the world of Gods. They
<>reached there and asked Indra for some Kahla1ra
<>flowers. Indra refused to give. Garud2a got ready to [Page704-b+ 65]
<>uproot the tree. Then Indra wielded his thunderbolt.
<>To honour the weapon thunderbolt, Garud2a left a
<>feather of his there and returned to Dva1raka1. Because
<>of the hitting of the thunderbolt, the peacock, mon-
<>goose and jungle crow were born from Garud2a. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a who won the war, returned with Satyabha1ma1
<>mounted on Garud2a, to Dva1raka1. The Kalpaka tree
<>brought from the world of gods, was planted in the
<>garden in front of the palace of Satyabha1ma1. When
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the Kalpaka tree became her own,
<>Satyabha1ma1 became proud. At that time Na1rada
<>came there. She asked Na1rada what she should do so
<>as to have S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the Kalpaka tree with her in
<>all births. Na1rada said that, for that, she had only to
<>do Tula1purus2ada1na. She instantly placed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>and the Kalpaka tree in the balance and all the things
<>placed in equal weight were given to Na1rada himself.
<>Na1rada received them and went to the world of Gods.
<>Satyabha1ma1 became overjoyed. She asked S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>what good deeds she had done to earn so much happi-
<>ness. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a described the previous birth of Satya-
<>bha1ma1. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 90).
<NI>2) {%Previous birth of Satyabha1ma1.%} Towards the close of
<>the Kr2tayuga, there was a Brahmin named Devas4arma1
<>who was born of the clan of Agni in Ma1ya1puri1. This
<>Brahmin was well-versed in the Vedas and the
<>Veda1n3gas. In the old age a daughter named Gun2avati1
<>was born to him. He gave his daughter to his
<>disciple Candras4arma1.
<NI>Once Devas4arma1 and Candras4arma1 went to the forest
<>to bring Darbha (poa) and Samit (butea). While they
<>were walking here and there in the Mango grove in
<>the Hima1layas a giant closed with them. Because of
<>terror their bodies were stiffened and so they could not
<>run. The fierce giant killed both of them. The escorts
<>sent by Vis2n2u came and took both of them to Vaikun2-
<>t2ha. Gun2avati1 cried aloud when she heard that her
<>father and husband were killed by a giant. She
<>lamented for a long while and then fainted and fell
<>down. When she came to herself she began to cry
<>again. At last she sold the furniture and conducted
<>the funeral rites of her father and husband. After that
<>she lived by manual labour. She observed fast and the
<>vow of Kr2ttika1 and Eka1das4i1.
<NI>Gun2avati1, who was weak and lean because of old age
<>and fever once walked slowly to the river Ganges to
<>bathe. When she got into the river she shivered be-
<>cause of cold. Then an aerial chariot came down
<>from the sky. The messengers of Vis2n2u took her in
<>the chariot, to Vaikun2t2ha. The celestial maids fanned
<>her with the whisk of yak. After this Maha1vis2n2u in-
<>carnated as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to destroy the wicked. Those
<>who were the dependants of Vis2n2u in Vaikun2t2ha took
<>birth in Dva1raka1. Devas4arma1 the father of Gun2avati1 took
<>birth as Satra1jit. Candras4arma1 became Akru1ra. Gun2a-
<>vati1 became Satyabha1ma1. Because of the goodness earned
<>by the fast of Kr2ttika1, she had become a beloved one of
<>Vis2n2u. Because she made a grove of holy basil (tulasi1)
<>at the gate of Vis2n2u in the previous birth the Kalpaka
<>tree came to her garden in this birth. Because she
<>lighted lamps in Ka1rttika month Maha1laks2mi1 lives
<>permanently in her house. Because she did fast and
<>vow in Ka1rttika imagining Vis2n2u as her husband, she
<>became the wife of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in this birth. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 91). [Page705-a+ 64]

<HI>SATYAKA1MA (SATYAKA1MA JA1BA1LA). A noble her-
<>mit. There is a story as given below, in the Cha1ndog-
<>yopanis2ad about the greatness of this hermit.
<NI>As his father died in his boyhood, Satyaka1ma was
<>brought up by his mother Ja1ba1li1. Whan it was time to
<>begin education, the boy told his mother, “Mother, I
<>would like to be educated under a teacher, in the
<>Vedas. But I don's know what clan I belong to.
<>What answer shall I give, when the teacher asks me
<>about my clan?” His mother Ja1ba1li1 replied. “I also
<>do not know much about the clan of your father who
<>married me when I was a girl. From that day onwards
<>I was engaged in house-keeping. I did not ask your
<>father about the clan. In my younger days I gave birth
<>to you. Shortly after that your father died. Tell your
<>teacher that you are Satyaka1ma the son of Ja1ba1li1.”
<NI>Having heard this Satyaka1ma went in search of a
<>teacher. At last he reached the hermitage of the sage
<>Gautama and told him every thing. The hermit was
<>attracted by his truthfulness and behaviour. Believing
<>that Satyaka1ma was a Brahmin boy, Gautama accepted
<>him as a disciple. The hermit entrusted the boy with
<>four hundred lean cows to look after. The boy accepted
<>the work, and said to the hermit. “When this becomes
<>a group of thousand fat cows, I will bring them back.”
<>He lived in the forest looking after the cows. The Devas [Page706-a+ 65]
<>sympathised with him. Va1yu (wind), the Sun, Agni
<>(fire) and Pra1n2a together gave him divine knowledge and
<>wisdom. After this Satyaka1ma returned to the hermit
<>Gautama with thousand fat cows. Seeing the boy whose
<>face shone with the light of God, the hermit was
<>amazed. “Who gave you divine knowledge?” asked
<>the hermit. Satyaka1ma told the hermit all that took
<>place. Fully satisfied with the boy, Gautama imparted
<>to him knowledge about the universal Soul (Parama1tma1)
<>and Satyaka1ma became a noble hermit.
<NI>Satyaka1ma got several disciples of whom Upakosala
<>was prominent. He approached Satyaka1ma as a student.
<>For twelve years he served his teacher and kept up the
<>fire in the firepit for burnt offering, without being ex-
<>tinguished throughout the twelve years, and worshipped
<>the fire god. Yet the teacher did not impart knowledge
<>to him. The teacher's wife recommended to her hus-
<>band that Upakosala should be given learning. But the
<>teacher was silent. Upakosala took a vow and fast
<>before the burnt-offering fire pit. Agni Deva felt pity for
<>him and informed him that God is all-pervading and
<>that his teacher would show him the way to God. When
<>he came to the teacher, his face was seen shining.
<>Satyaka1ma asked Upakosala for the reason. Upakosala
<>told the teacher what the fire god had told him.

<>yoga (union) by knowledge of the Sa1n3khyas.

<HI>SATYATAPAS (UTATHYA) I. A brahmin boy who was

<>Later he came to be known as Satyatapas. The story of
<>this S4atyatapas is given in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 3,
<>as follows:-
<NI>In days of old, there was a Brahmin named Devadatta
<>in Kosala. His wife was called Rohin2i1. Though much
<>time elapsed no child was born to them. At last Deva-
<>datta performed the sacrifice called Putraka1mes2t2i, on the
<>banks of the river Tamasa1. Several saintly persons
<>took part in the sacrifice. Suhotra was detailed as
<>Brahma1, Ya1jn5avalkya as officiating priest, Br2haspati as
<>sacrificer, Paila to recite Vedas and Godila to sing Sa1man
<>hymns. The singing of Godila, an expert singer, caused
<>horripilation to everybody in the sacrificial hall. But in
<>the middle of singing he had to take breath, and there
<>occurred a solecism in his voice. Devadatta did not like
<>it. He warned Godila, who instantly became angry and
<>said to Devadatta. “Since you called me Cobra, the son
<>born to you will become a cobra.” [Page708-b+ 65]
<NI>Devadatta became miserable and begged Godila by
<>holding his feet to pardon him. He gave liberation
<>from the curse that his son would be a cobra and
<>said that he would become a sage.
<NI>The wife of Devadatta became pregnant and gave
<>birth to a son. He was named Utathya. In the
<>eighth year, the ceremony of investiture with the
<>Brahma1 string was performed and the boy commenced
<>education. The teacher began to teach the Vedas.
<>From that day onwards the boy became self-conceited.
<>All the attempts made by the teacher to change his
<>behaviour were futile. His father tried the four ex-
<>pedients in vain. Thus twelve years elapsed. The
<>boy did not even learn the evening prayer. Everybody
<>thought that he was a cobra. All scoffed at him. His
<>own people disliked him; with this; self-renunciation
<>took root in his boyish mind and he left his home and
<>went away. He reached the banks of the Ganges and
<>made a hut there and lived there observing rigorous
<>celibacy, and vow of truth. Thus the boy-hermit
<>began severe penance.
<NI>He had learned no rites or rituals according to the
<>Vedas. He would rise early in the morning, and after
<>cleaning the teeth he would take a dip in the Gangetic
<>waters, without any spells or actions and return to the
<>hut. He would eat anything that came by. He would
<>cause no harm to anybody, though he had no power to
<>do good to anybody. Everybody in the neighbourhood
<>began to realize that he was a boy who would on no
<>account utter falsehood. So all began to call him
<>Satyatapas. Satyatapas had no peace of mind. Life
<>seemed to be a burden to him. He became thoughtful
<>day and night. Thus he spent fourteen years there.
<>People firmly believed in his truthfulness. So they
<>named him Satyavrata. Once a forester came near his
<>hut. He sent an arrow at a hog, which ran into the
<>hermitage with the arrow sticking on its body. Blood
<>was oozing from its wound. The jungle-dweller also
<>came into the hut followlng the hog. Seeing Satya-
<>vrata the man asked “Where is the hog that I had
<>shot?” Satyavrata who knew that killing animals was a
<>sin, kept silence to save the beast. Devi1 was pleased
<>at the moral courage and truthfulness of Satyavrata. It
<>is said that the moment the hog got into the hermitage,
<>the Sa1rasvata syllable ‘Ai’ arose from the tongue of
<>Satyavrata. The moment he had pronounced the
<>rootsound of Sarasvati1, ‘Ai’, by the grace of Devi1, he
<>became a poet like Va1lmi1ki. Looking at the forester
<>Satyavrata said:
<Poem>“Ya1h2 pas4yati na sa bru1te
<>Yo bru1te sa na pas4yati /
<>Aho! vya1dha, svaka1rya1rthin
<>Kam pr2cchasi punah2 punah2 //</Poem>
<NI>“He who sees does not speak. He who speaks, does not
<>see. Selfish hunter, whom do you ask again and again?”
<>When the forester heard these words of Satyavrata, the
<>bow and arrow fell from his hands. With self-renun-
<>ciation he went away from the hermitage. The fame
<>of the great poet Satyavrata spread everywhere. His
<>father also heard about this from others. He came to
<>the bank of the Ganges and took his son home. Even
<>today Brahmins sing about the fame of that hermit on
<>the New moon days.
<HI>SATYATAPAS II. A hermit. Once he cursed a
<>celestial maid who had tried to hinder his penance, to [Page709-a+ 65]
<>become a phoenix tree. Later this hermit liberated her
<>from the curse. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttarakhan2d2a, Chap-

<HI>SATYAVA1K I. A son of Ca1ks2us2a Manu. Ten sons
<>including Satyava1k, were born to Ca1ks2us2a Manu by
<>his wife Nad2vala1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 18).
<HI>SATYAVA1K II. A Deva Gandharva. This Gandharva
<>was the son born to Praja1pati Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Muni. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 43).
<HI>SATYAVARMA1. A brother of Sus4arma1 the King of
<>Trigarta. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 17, Verse 17).
<HI>SATYAVATI1 I. The mother of Vya1sa.
<NI>1) {%A short history.%} Satyavati1 was the daughter of the
<>celestial maid Adrika1. Because of a curse she lived as
<>a fish in the river Ganges. Once the semen of King
<>Uparicaravasu happened to fall in the Ganges and
<>this fish swallowed it in consequence of which it became
<>pregnant. A fisherman caught this fish and cut it. He
<>got two human babies, male and female from the
<>stomach of the fish. The fisherman gave the two
<>infants to the King who took the male child. This
<>child later became the Matsya King. The female child
<>had the smell of fish. The King called her Matsya-
<>Gandhi1 (She who has the smell of fish) and gave her
<>back to the fisherman, who took the child to his hut
<>and brought her up as his daughter. As the child was
<>dark in complexion the fisherman called her Ka1li1. Thus
<>the girl was known by two names Ka1li1 and Matsya-
<>gandhi1. Later she got the name Satyavati1 also.
<NI>The fisherman was engaged in the work of ferrying
<>people across the river. Matsyagandhi1 helped her
<>father in this work. She became a full-bloomed young
<>woman. One day the hermit Para1s4ara came by that
<>way and when he saw Matsyagandhi1, he fell in love
<>with her. She ferried the hermit across the river. In
<>the middle of the river Para1s4ara created an artificial fog
<>inside which Para1s4ara took Matsyagandhi1 as his wife.
<>From that moment Matsyagandhi1 became Kastu1ri1-
<>gandhi1 (she who has the smell of Kastu1ri1 (musk).
<>Ka1li1 became pregnant and delivered instantly. Para1-
<>s4ara, left the place after having blessed her that she
<>would not lose her virginity.
<NI>The son born to Ka1li1, immediately grew up to be a
<>youth. After promising his mother that he would
<>come to her when she thought of him, the youth went
<>to the forest for penance. The name of the son was
<>Kr2s2n2a. This Kr2s2n2a later became famous by the name
<>Vya1sa. Satyavati1 again engaged herself in helping her
<>father.
<NI>One day S4antanu, a King of the lunar dynasty came to
<>the forest for hunting. The fragrance of musk emanat-
<>ing from the body of Kastu1ri1gandhi1 spread throughout
<>the whole forest. The King walked on through the
<>forest tracing the origin of the smell of musk and
<>reached the fisherman's hut. The King fell in love with
<>Satyavati1. The King had a son named Bhi1s2ma by his
<>first wife Gan3ga1. Bhi1s2ma made it easy for the King to [Page709-b+ 65]
<>marry Satyavati1. Two sons Citra1n3gada and Vicitra-
<>vi1rya were born to S4antanu by his wife Satyavati1.
<>Citra1n3gada was killed in his boyhood. Vicitravi1rya
<>became a youth and married Ambika1 and Amba1lika1
<>the daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1. Vicitravi1rya met
<>with untimely death before a child was born to him.
<>When Satyavati1 saw that the family was about to
<>become extinct, she thought of her son Vya1sa, who
<>instantly arrived at the palace. From Vya1sa, Amba1lika1
<>got the son Pa1n2d2u and Ambika1, the son Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>Both the sons Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u got married.
<>Pa1n2d2u died. The death of her son struck heavily at
<>the heart of Satyavati1. She did not wish to live much
<>longer after this. She mentioned about the fearful
<>things yet to happen. Then taking her daughters-in-
<>law Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 with her, Satyavati1 went to
<>the forest to do penance and finally attained heaven.

<>Saubhari went to the forest. His wives, who also had
<>become disinterested in worldly enjoyment, followed

<NI>1) {%General.%} A renowned a1ca1rya. He is believed to be
<>the author of the famous works--“R2gveda Anu-
<>kraman2i1”, “A1ran2yakam”, “R2kpra1tis4a1khya”, etc.
<NI>The famous A1s4vala1yana1ca1rya was S4aunaka's disciple.
<>A1ca1ryas like Ka1tya1yana, Patan5jali and Vya1sa belonged
<>to his class. S4aunaka's real name was “Gr2tsamada”. It
<>was because he was the son of S4unaka that he got the
<>name “S4aunaka”.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4aunahotra, the son of the sage S4unahotra,
<>once performed a ya1ga. Indra attended that ya1ga. At
<>that time S4aunahotra rescued Indra from an attack of

<>the Bhr2gu family under the name “S4aunaka”.
<NI>3) {%Genealogy%} In Va1yu Pura1n2a his genealogy is given in
<>two forms.
<NI>i) Ruru (Pramadvara1)-S4unaka-S4aunaka-Ugras4ravas
<NI>ii) Dharmavr2ddha--S4unahotra--Gr2tsamada--
<>S4unaka--S4aunaka. (Va1yu Pura1n2a, 92, 26).
<NI>4) {%Important works.%} S4aunaka is believed to be the author
<>of numerous works. The most important of them are
<>given below:--
<NI>(1) R2kpra1tis4a1khya (2) R2gvedacchanda1nukraman2i1 (3)

<>Matsya Pura1n2a, Chapter 252 mentions that S4aunaka
<>had written a work on the science of architecture.
<NI>5) {%Disciples.%} The chief disciple of S4aunaka was A1s4va-
<>la1yana. Once A1s4vala1yana wrote and dedicated to his
<>Guru (master) two treatises entitled “Gr2hyasu1tra” and
<>“S4rautasu1tra” to please him. After reading it, S4aunaka
<>destroyed his own work on “S4rautas4a1stra”. A1s4vala1yana
<>wrote his treatise after having studied the ten works of
<>S4aunaka on R2gveda.
<NI>Ka1tya1yana, the disciple of A1s4vala1yana later received
<>the ten books written by S4aunaka and the three books
<>written by A1s4vala1yana. Ka1tya1yana gave his disciple
<>Patan5jali, the two works, “Yajurvedakalpasu1tra” and
<>“Sa1maveda Upagrantha” which were written by him-
<>self. From this we may infer that the series of S4aunaka's
<>disciples was as follows:--S4aunaka--A1s4vala1yana--
<>Ka1tya1yana--Patan5jali--Vya1sa.
<HI>S4AUNAKA II. A Bra1hman2a who went to the forest with

<>Having drunk too much of celestial honey (amr2ta)
<>which is the essence of the six tastes (s2ad2rasas), Brahma1
<>had to vomit, on which occasion, the cow Surabhi
<>sprang up from his face. Her milk having accumulated
<>in a low place the milk-sea was formed. The hermits
<>known as the Phenapas live on the shore of the milk
<>sea, the foam that settles on the shore being their food.
<>Around them, there are four cows which protect the
<>four directions. Saurabhi1 is one of them. She supports
<>the east. Ham3sika1 bears the south, Subhadra1 the west
<>and Dhenu the north. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>102).
<HI>S4AURI. Vasudeva, the son of S4u1rasena.
<HI>SAUS4ALYA. A country in ancient India very famous in
<>the Pura1n2as. (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9,

<>in the form that we see today.
<NI>The story of Maha1bha1rata composed by Vya1sa and
<>Vais4ampa1yana contained only a graphic description of
<>the battle of Bha1rata. No vivid description of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a born of the Ya1dava dynasty and of the Ya1davas,
<>was given in it. To remove this deficiency, Sauti
<>added an appendix called ‘Harivam3s4a’ to Svarga1rohan2a
<>Parva in Maha1bha1rata. (For further details see under
<>Bha1rata I). [Page711-b+ 65]
<HI>SAUVI1RA. An ancient country near the river Sindhu.

<HI>SAVANA. I.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Son of Priyavrata who was the son of
<>Sva1yambhuva Manu, by his wife, Suru1pa1. Suru1pa1 had
<>ten sons including Savana. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>8).
<NI>2) {%Birth of son.%} Savana married Suveda1, daughter of
<>Suna1bha; but he expired before children were born to
<>him. According to the Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 72,
<>seven children were born from the dead Savana. The
<>story about it is as follows:--
<NI>Suveda1, heart-broken at the death of Savana, did not
<>permit the dead body to be burnt, herself holding it in
<>embrace. Then a celestial voice said to her: “Cry
<>not. If you are really chaste and true, enter the
<>funeral pyre along with your husband.” To this Suveda1
<>answered thus: “I cry because of grief that he died
<>before making me the mother of a son.” The celestial
<>voice said to her again: “You enter the pyre without
<>weeping. Your husband will have seven sons.”
<NI>Sudeva1 now permitted her dead husband to be cremat-
<>ed and meditating upon her chastity she jumped into
<>the funeral pyre. But within minutes Savana came
<>alive out of the fire with his wife and rose to the sky
<>with her. He stayed in the sky for another five days
<>and on the sixth day had the sexual act again with
<>her. His semen dropped on earth from the sky. The
<>King then with his wife went to Brahmaloka.
<NI>Sama1da1, Nalini1, Pus2yati, Citra1, Vis4a1la1, Harita1 and
<>Alini1la1, all of them wives of munis saw the semen in
<>the sky and when it fell into the water they thought it
<>was amr2ta, which conferred eternal youth, and with
<>the permission of their husbands swallowed it. As soon
<>as they swallowed it their divine effulgence was dimi-
<>nished and their husbands, therefore, abandoned them.
<>Those women delivered seven children, who cried
<>fiercely and that sound filled the entire universe. Then
<>Brahma1 appeared and asked the children not to cry and
<>also told them that they would come to be called
<>Maruts. Brahma1 himself called them Maruts. They
<>were the Maruts of the first Sva1yambhuva Manuvantara.
<HI>SAVANA II. One of the seven sons of Bhr2gumuni,
<>the other six being Cyavana, Vajras4i1rs2a, S4uci, Aurva,
<>S4ukra and Vibhu. They are called Varun2as also.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 129).
<HI>S4A1VANTA. A King born in the dynasty of emperor
<>Pr2thu. He was the son of Yuvana1s4va and father of
<>Br2hadas4va. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<HI>SAVARN2A1. Wife of the muni called Pra1ci1nabarhis.
<>Savarn2a1 was the daughter of Samudra (ocean). (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 14). The couple had ten
<>sons called the Pracetases, and they were very efficient
<>in Dhanurveda. All of them engaged themselves in
<>obserying the same dharma (duty) and did tapas for
<>10,000 years under the sea. (For details see under
<>Pra1ci1nabarhis).
<HI>SA1VARN2A I. A hermit. This hermit shone in the
<>council of Yudhis2t2hira. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 4, Verse 15.) [Page712-a+ 65]
<HI>SA1VARN2A II. (SA1VARN2I). A Manu. (For further
<>details see under Manvantara).
<HI>SA1VARN2I I. The eighth Manu. (For further details
<>see under Manvantara),
<HI>SA1VARN2I II. A hermit. This hermit shone in the
<>council of Indra. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>7, Verse 10). This hermit Sa1varn2i did penance for six
<>thousand years in Satyayuga. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 14, Verse 103).
<HI>SAVITA1. One of the twelve sons of Kas4yapapraja1pati

<HI>SA1VITRA III. A lofty peak of the mountain Sumeru.
<>Jyotis2ka is another name of this peak, which is
<>not approachable. It is adorned with precious stones
<>and is glorified by all. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 once sat on
<>this peak and did penance. It was on this peak that
<>Devi1 Gan3ga1 did penance to S4iva, assuming a divine
<>figure. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 283, Verse 5).
<HI>SA1VITRI1 I.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The daughter of the Sun. This
<>Sa1vitri1 is the elder sister of Tapati1. Brahma1 married
<>these sisters. It is stated in some Pura1n2as that Sa1vitri1,
<>Ga1yatri1, Sarasvati1 all these are one and the same. But
<>there is a story in Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2ikhan2d2a, Chapter
<>17, stating that Brahma1 once went to Ga1yatri1 in the
<>absence of Sa1vitri1, who got angry at this and cursed all
<>the Gods.
<NI>Once Brahma1 went to Pus2kara to perform a sacrifice.
<>S4iva, Vis2n2u and all the hermits came there. Everything
<>was ready for the sacrifice according to convention.
<>But Sa1vitri1, who had been engaged in household duties
<>had not yet arrived. So a priest was sent to bring her.
<>Sa1vitri1 said to the priest, “I have not finished dressing.
<>There are so many things to be done here. Moreover,
<>Laks2mi1, Bhava1ni1, Gan3ga1, Sva1ha1, Indra1n2i1, celestial
<>women, wives of R2s2is (hermits), none of these have
<>arrived yet. How can I enter the hall as the only
<>woman?” The priest returned and reported that it
<>was not convenient for Sa1vitri1 to come just then, as she
<>had so much work to do. Brahma1 became angry and
<>said to Indra. “Lord Indra, it is up to you to bring
<>me a wife from wherever you like. But it must be
<>done instantly.” Hearing the order of Brahma1, Indra
<>selected Ga1yatri1 who was a good-natured damsel of a
<>cowherd's family, and brought her to the sacrificial
<>dais. With the blessings of the hermits and gods, Brahma1
<>held her hand and acknowledged her as his wife.
<NI>Sa1vitri1 dressed well, adorned herself with ornaments and
<>reached the sacrificial hall. She saw the marrige scene
<>and became furious. Everybody in the hall held their
<>breath, thinking of the approaching danger. Trembling
<>with anger Sa1vitri1 said “Lo; Brahma1, how is it that you
<>have committed this sin? Have you not married me with [Page712-b+ 65]
<>fire as witness? I am your wife. Are you not ashamed
<>of this?” The three godheads shivered with fear. Sa1vitri1
<>cursed everybody. The curse given to Brahma1 was that
<>no body should worship him on any other day except
<>the month of Ka1rttika in the year. She cursed Indra
<>that enemies would enter the world of gods and would
<>make Indra their captive. Sa1vitri1 cried out that Vis2n2u
<>would take the birth of man by the curse of Bhr2gu. She
<>cursed S4iva that he would lose his manliness. She gave
<>Agni the curse that he would eat anything and every-
<>thing without the discrimination of purity or impurity.
<>She cursed the Brahmins that they would, in future per-
<>form sacrifice merely with a view to obtain gifts and
<>that they would be wandering about from temple to
<>temple and from ti1rtha to ti1rtha merely for gain.”
<NI>Uttering these words of curse, Sa1vitri1 left the sacrificial
<>hall. Laks2mi1 and some other goddesses followed her a
<>little while. Then they begged for permission to return.
<>Sa1vitri1 said to them, “Laks2mi1! You are leaving me. Is it
<>not so? Right. Hereafter you shall be permanent no-
<>where. May you become the companion of the wicked,
<>the wavering, the low-minded, the sinner, the cruel, the
<>foolish etc. Indra1n2i1 also wants to return. Hear this:
<>Indra will kill Vr2tra and incur the sin of Brahmahatya1
<>and at that time Nahus2a will capture heaven. Then
<>Nahus2a will abuse you.”
<NI>Looking at the celestial women who were going to the
<>sacrificial hall, Sa1vitri1 said; Look, Ye celestial women.
<>None of you will give birth to child and you will
<>not enjoy the pleasure of nurturing a child.” Saying
<>these words Sa1vitri1 left the hall. Not knowing what to
<>do, all sat there. Instantly Ga1yatri1 rose up and looking
<>at everybody, said as a remission of curses: “I shall remit
<>all curses. Those who worship Brahma1, will be blessed
<>with the pleasure of wife and children and wealth and
<>they will unite with Brahma1. Even if Indra is taken
<>captive, he will be made free by his son and will become
<>the king of heaven again. Vis2n2u will rescue his wife and
<>kill the enemy. The phallus will be worshipped in all
<>the worlds. As Brahmins are the gods on earth the gift
<>you take, will be considered your dues. Laks2mi1! you
<>need not worry. Everybody will worship you. He whom
<>you favour will become a well-to-do person and he whom
<>you forsake will become miserable. You Indra1n2i1! Because
<>of Nahus2a's arrogance Agastya will change him to a big
<>python and he will fall to the earth. The celestial maids
<>will have no desire for children. So childlessness will
<>not make you miserable.” By these words of blessings
<>of Ga1yatri1, everybody in the sacrificial hall was paci-
<>fied.
<NI>2. {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Sa1vitri1 shines in the palace of Brahma1. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 34).
<NI>(ii) Sa1vitri1 is the sovereign deity of the mantra Ga1yatri1.
<>This goddess Sa1vitri1 rose up from the sacrificial fire of
<>King As4vapati and gave him a boon, and accordingly a
<>daughter named Sa1vitri1 was born to the King. This
<>princess was Sa1vitri1 the wife of Satyava1n. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 290).
<NI>(iii) S4iva, on starting for Tripuradahana (the burning
<>of Tripuras), placed Sa1vitri1 as the bridles of his horses.
<>(M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 202, Verse 75).
<NI>(iv) Once Ja1paka Brahmin worshipped Devi1 Sa1vitri1,
<>who appeared before him and gave him boons. As the
<>Brahmin was engaged in deep meditation and prayer, [Page713-a+ 64]
<>he did not see the Devi1 when she appeared. It was due
<>to this piety that the Brahmin was given boons. (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 199).
<NI>(v) Once Devi1 Sa1vitri1 appeared before Satya, a brahm-
<>in of Vidarbha. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 272, Verse
<>11).
<NI>(vi) Once Devi1 Sa1vitri1 praised the giving of rice as alms.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 8).
<HI>SA1VITRI1 II. A hand-maid of Devi1 Uma1. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 231, Verse 49).
<HI>SA1VITRI1 III. A Sa1vitri1 who was the wife of a king and
<>a righteous woman is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 234, Verse 24. This Sa1vitri1 gave two
<>ear-rings as alms and attained heaven.
<HI>SA1VITRI1 IV. The wife of Satyava1n.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} In the country of Madra, famous in the
<>Pura1n2as, there was a king named As4vapati. His wife was
<>Ma1lati1. Though the couple grew old they were child-
<>less. At last they worshipped Devi1 Sa1vitri1. After vows
<>and prayers for eighteen years the Devi1 appeared before
<>them, and giving them the boon that a daughter would
<>be born to them, she disappeared. The couple returned
<>to the palace and Ma1lati1 conceived and delivered a
<>daughter whom they named Sa1vitri1. (Skandha 9, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata; Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 293).
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Sa1vitri1 grew up as though Laks2mi1 had
<>taken an incarnation and bloomed into a beautiful
<>damsel. But nobody came forward to marry her. On
<>a New moon day she bathed and purified herself and
<>getting the blessings of Brahmins, came and bowed
<>before her father. The King felt sorry as nobody had
<>offered to marry her though she was in the full bloom of
<>youth. He advised her to travel in the outside world
<>and to select a husband by herself. According to the
<>order of her father she took the aged ministers of the
<>King and travelled through the forests in which hermits
<>lived.
<NI>Once Na1rada came to the palace and while he was
<>talking with King As4vapati, Sa1vitri1 and the aged
<>ministers returned. She bowed before her father and
<>Na1rada. As soon as Na1rada saw her, he asked with
<>curiosity about her marriage. The father replied that he
<>had sent her in search of a husband. Sa1vitri1 said “I have
<>accepted the Prince Satyava1n as my husband. He is
<>the son of King Dyumatsena of Sa1lva. Dyumatsena
<>became blind in his old age, and taking this opportunity
<>his enemies captured his country. Dyumatsena with
<>his wife and son went to the forest and lived there.”
<NI>Na1rada described the qualities of Satyava1n. “Satyava1n
<>is as radiant as the sun, as intelligent as Br2haspati,
<>as valiant as Indra and as patient as the Earth.
<>As4vapati was immensely pleased at hearing about the
<>good qualities of Satyava1n, and asked Na1rada, if
<>there was anything to say against him. Na1rada said
<>that he had nothing to say against Satyava1n except
<>that he would die “within one year from this date.”
<>(Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 294).
<NI>The King felt miserable when he heard this. Sa1vitri1
<>said that she had accepted Satyava1n as her husband
<>and that nothing could make her waver from her
<>decision even if he is not going to live more than a
<>year. The King agreed to the wish of his daughter and
<>preparations for the marriage were begun. The King
<>went with Sa1vitri1 to the forest and saw Dyumatsena [Page713-b+ 63]
<>who gladly consented to the marriage. As4vapati return-
<>ed to the palace leaving Sa1vitri1 with Satyava1n and his
<>parents. As soon as As4vapati had returned, Sa1vitri1 dis-
<>carded her ornaments and assumed the dress suitable
<>to life in the forest and lived with them.
<NI>3) {%The death of Satyava1n.%} It was nearly a year and the day
<>of death of Satyava1n was fast approaching. There were
<>only four days more. Sa1vitri1 had taken a vow lasting
<>for three days. Dyumatsena dissuaded her from taking
<>fast. She completed the fast. There was left only one
<>night more. She kept awake for the whole night.
<>Morning came. Though she ended her fast she had not
<>taken any food. Dyumatsena wanted to know the
<>reason. She humbly said that she would eat only after
<>sun-set.
<NI>As usual Satyava1n took his axe and started for the wood.
<>Sa1vitri1 also followed him.
<NI>Satyava1n:-“You have never accompanied me before.
<>Moreover you are very weak on account of the fast.
<>Then how can you come with me?”
<NI>Sa1vitri1: “I am not at all weak by the fast and vow. I
<>want to come with you. I pray, don't hinder me.”
<NI>At last Satyava1n consented after getting the permission of
<>his parents. Both went to the forest to gather fruits and
<>roots. They gathered fruits and roots. Then Satyava1n began
<>to cut wood. By that exertion Satyava1n sweated all over.
<>He was affected by headache. “Let me lie down!” He said.
<>The axe fell from his hand. Sa1vitri1 caught her husband
<>who was falling down and laid him on her lap. Sa1vitri1
<>saw a person clad in blood-coloured garments, with red
<>eyes and a rope in hand, coming towards them. He
<>came to the spot and stood there looking at the body of
<>Satyava1n. Realizing the person to be Ka1la (Deathgod)
<>Sa1vitri1 stood up instantly and bowed before him.
<NI>Sa1vitri1:--“Who are you Lord. What may be your
<>object in coming here?”
<NI>Yama:--Hei, Sa1vitri1. As you are a hermitess of chas-
<>tity I may converse with you. I am Yama. I am come to
<>take away the life of your husband.”
<NI>Sa1vitri1:--“Lord, I have heard that your messengers
<>come and take away the souls. How is it that you have
<>come in person today?”
<NI>Yama:--This Satyava1n is a righteous man who is an
<>ocean of good qualities. Messengers are not sent, in the
<>cases of persons like him.”
<NI>Saying thus Yama cast his rope and caught the soul of
<>Satyava1n. Sa1vitri1 saw the body of her husband lying
<>without life and soul. Sa1vitri1 followed Yama who had
<>gone to the south with the soul of Satyava1n.
<NI>Yama:--Child, you go back and conduct his funerals.
<>You have followed your husband as far as you can.
<NI>Sa1vitri1:--I am coming to the place where my husband
<>is being taken. That is the duty of a wife. What im-
<>pediment is there on my way to follow you, when I
<>have the merits of vow, fast, devotion to my elders, love
<>and regard for my husband and the good will of your-
<>self, my Lord.”
<NI>When Yama realized that it was difficult to send
<>Sa1vitri1 back, he asked Sa1vitri1 to ask for any boon. Yama
<>was prepared to give anything except the life of Satya-
<>va1n. She requested for the recovery of sight by Dyumat-
<>sena. Yama granted it. Still Sa1vitri1 did not turn back.
<>Yama asked her to pray for one more boon. She [Page714-a+ 65]
<>requested for the recovery of the lost kingdom of Dyu-
<>matsena. Yama sanctioned that request also. Still she
<>followed Yama, who was ready to grant her a third
<>boon. She requested: “My father may, please be given
<>a hundred sons who would continue the family. Yama
<>granted that too. But she did not turn back. Yama
<>told her that she might ask for a fourth boon. She said:
<>“I may be given a hundred sons born directly from
<>Satyava1n. Yama granted this fourth boon also. Then
<>Sa1vitri1 asked Yama how the boon would be realized
<>unless the life of Satyava1n was given back to him.
<>Yama was pleased with her at her love and devotion
<>for her husband and returned the life of Satya-
<>va1n. Yama blessed her that she and Satyava1n would
<>live for hundred years.
<NI>Yama disappeared. Sa1vitri1 returned and sat there
<>taking the body of Satyava1n on her lap. Satyava1n
<>came to life. Both of them rose up. Night came on. It
<>was dark. They could not find the way. Satyava1n
<>wanted to reach their hermitage somehow. Sa1vitri1
<>took the axe and supporting her husband in the dim
<>moon light, walked to the hermitage.
<NI>Dyumatsena got sight. He started with his wife in
<>search of his children, and walked about in the forest.
<>At last all of them met together. They reached home.
<>Then Sa1vitri1 told them all that had happened. Every-
<>one was delighted. Then some people from Sa1lva came
<>to the hermitage. They said that the minister had
<>killed the King, that the people had expelled the
<>minister, and that they had come to request Dyumat-
<>sena to return to his country and to resume the reign.
<>Accordingly all of them returned to Sa1lva. Dyumatsena
<>was anointed as the King of Sa1lva. (M.B. Vana Parva,

<>Us4i1nara-S4ibi.
<NI>S4ibi was born to Us4i1nara of Ma1dhavi1, daughter of

<NI>2) {%Suhotra made to give way.%} King Suhotra of Kuru
<>dynasty once on his return from a visit of mahars2is saw
<>King S4ibi coming in the opposite direction in his
<>chariot, and both the Kings saluted each other as their
<>age ordained. But, they did not give passage to each
<>other as they thought themselves to be equal in merit.
<>At that time Na1rada came there and asked the kings
<>why they stood there thus blocking the path. They
<>answered Na1rada thus: “He who is more noble or
<>clever on account of former actions etc. is usually
<>given way to by the other person. Both of us are
<>comrades and are equals.”
<NI>Na1rada then spoke as follows:--
<NI>“Oh! King of the Kuru dynasty! You are cruel to the
<>gentle and gentle to the cruel. To the evil you are
<>good; then why not be good to the good. Devas have
<>ordered that he who does good will get it hundred-
<>fold by return. King Us4i1nara is more noble and gentle
<>than you are. The miser is won over by liberality,
<>the liar by truth, the cruel by patience and the evil
<>person by good. But, both of you Kings are noble
<>persons. Therefore, one of you should give way to the
<>other.”
<NI>Listening to Na1rada's advice, Suhotra gave way to
<>S4ibi and proceeded on his way. (Vana Parva, Chapter
<>194).
<NI>3) {%S4ibi tested.%} S4ibi's fame spread in the three worlds,
<>and an idea was mooted among the Devas that it should
<>be tested how much of the reputation of the King was
<>genuine. Accordingly, Agni in the form of a dove
<>and Indra in that of a kite hunting after the dove,
<>rushed to King S4ibi. The dove took refuge in the lap
<>of the King sitting in ‘divya’ posture, and the priest
<>told the King that it was the latter's duty to protect
<>the dove, which took refuge with him for its life. The
<>dove also told the King thus; “I am really a muni,
<>who has entered the body of the dove. I take refuge
<>in you for my life.”
<NI>By that time the kite too had flown up to the King. It
<>asked the King to return the dove, which it had been
<>chasing. The King was surprised to hear the kite talk
<>and told the bird that it was not proper for him to give
<>up the dove who had sought refuge under him, but
<>that he would give the kite any other flesh in lieu of the [Page716-a+ 64]
<>dove. The kite replied as follows: “You must give me
<>flesh cut from your right thigh equal in weight to that
<>of the dove. If you do so, the dove will be saved and
<>you will be praised by people.”
<NI>Accordingly, the King cut a piece of flesh from his
<>right thigh and weighed it in the balance against the
<>dove. But, the dove weighed more. The King cut more
<>flesh from his thigh and weighed, but the dove still
<>weighed more. Thus, by instalments the King cut his
<>whole body and weighed the flesh against the dove,
<>yet it weighed more. Then the King himself sat in the
<>balance, seeing which the kite flew away. Then the
<>dove assumed its original form and told the King that
<>it was Agni and the kite, Indra. The Devas were
<>greatly pleased with the firm sense of sacrifice of the
<>King; they blessed him and told him that a son called
<>Kapotaroma1 will be born to him. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 197).
<NI>4) {%Other information.%}

<>promised to transfer to him the merits acquired by
<>him (S4ibi). (A1di Parva, Chapter 93, Verse 3).

<>battle between King Vira1t2a and Kauravas at the
<>Vira1t2a city in connection with the lifting of Vira1t2a's
<>cow by the Kauravas. (Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56, Verse
<>9).
<NI>(iv) S4ibi loved Indra very much. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,

<>(S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 166, Verse 89).
<NI>(vi) He gifted away his son to the brahmins, and

<NI>1) {%Who is Si1ta1?%} Si1ta1 is the incarnation of Maha1laks2mi1.
<>Laks2mi1 took the birth of a woman because of the curse
<>of Sarasvati1. Vedavati1, Si1ta1, Pa1n5ca1li1, all these women
<>of chastity were the incarnations of Laks2mi1 The stories

<>world of Vis2n2u, occurring in various Pura1n2as are
<>collected and given here.
<NI>Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1 and Gan3ga1 were the wives of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. One day Vis2n2u was sitting with his three wives
<>and entertaining them with conversation when Devi1
<>Gan3ga1 looked at Vis2n2u amorously. Instantly a quarrel
<>arose among the three of them. When the row became
<>uncontrollable, Sarasvati1 cursed Laks2mi1 to take birth
<>in the earth as a plant. Gan2ga1 cursed Sarasvati1 and
<>made her a river. Sarasvati1 cursed Gan3ga1 and made her
<>a river. At the end of all these rows and curses Vis2n2u
<>stood up and said to Laks2mi1. “Laks2mi1! you will take
<>birth as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja on the earth
<>with the name Tulasi1. In order that the curse of Sarasvati1
<>may come true, a plant called Tulasi1 (holy basil) will
<>grow up on the earth from a portion of you. While
<>you are living as the daughter of Dharmadhvaja, an
<>asura named S4an3khacu1d2a born from my portion will
<>marry you.”
<NI>The curse was realized. Sarasvati1 and Gan3ga1 became
<>rivers. Laks2mi1 was about to be born as the daughter
<>of Dharmadhvaja. Who was Dharmadhvaja? He was
<>a man of righteous deeds and good qualities, born of
<>the family of Daks2asa1varn2i who was born from a portion
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Brahmasa1varn2i1 was born from Daks2asa1-
<>varni. Dharmasa1varn2i begot Rudrasa1varn2i, Indrasa1-
<>varn2i begot Vr2s2adhvaja. Rathadhvaja was the son
<>of Vr2s2adhvaja. Two sons named Dharmadhvaja and
<>Kus4adhvaja were born to Rathadhvaja. Dharmadhvaja
<>and Kus4adhvaja were performing penance before Devi1
<>Laks2mi1 to regain the wealth and prosperity lost by the
<>curse of the Sun.
<NI>How did Dharmadhvaja and Kus4adhvaja lose their
<>prosperity? Their grandfather Vr2s2adhvaja was a devotee
<>of S4iva. He performed penance before S4iva for a long
<>time. S4iva became pleased with Vr2s2adhvaja and lived
<>in his hermitage for the period of three Devayugas. This
<>king Vr2s2adhvaja made a proclamation that none other
<>than S4iva should be worshipped. As all the other gods
<>were despised, the Sun got angry and cursed Vr2s2adhvaja.
<>“Let the prosperity of yours and your posterity be dest-
<>royed.” S4iva did not like the action taken by the Sun
<>against his favourite. S4iva took his trident and went
<>against the Sun, who took refuge near his father Pra-
<>ja1pati Kas4yapa. Kas4yapa complained to Brahma1.
<>Brahma1 ran to Vaikun2t2ha. S4iva also came there with
<>his trident. Vis2n2u looked at them and said “You
<>gods, hear this. What is the need of all this hurry?
<>Within the short time you have taken to run up to this
<>place so many years have elapsed in the world. It is a
<>long time since Vr2s2adhavaja died. His son Rathadhvaja
<>also is dead. Rathadhvaja has two sons named Dhar-
<>madhvaja and Kus4adhvaja. They both have become
<>Kings. But because of the curse of the Sun, they are
<>devoid of any radiance. They are now worshipping
<>Maha1laks2mi1 for radiance.” Hearing this talk of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u all of them returned to their places.
<NI>It has been mentioned that Dharmadhvaja and Kus4a-
<>dhvaja had been engaged in penance before Maha1laks2mi1.
<>Devi1 Maha1laks2mi1 appeared before them and granted
<>their wish. Devi1 promised them that she would take
<>birth as the daughter of each of them, and she would
<>recover for them all the wealth and prosperity they had
<>lost. Accordingly Maha1laks2mi1 took birth by her portion
<>as the daughter of Ma1dhavi1, the wife of Dharmadhvaja [Page721-a+ 65]
<>under the name Tulasi1. (For the rest of the story of
<>Tulasi1 see under Tulasi1, Para 4).
<NI>Ma1la1vati1 was the wife of Kus4adhvaja. As Laks2mi1 had
<>promised to take birth as their daughter, both of them
<>waited for the birth of the child uttering the Vedas. At
<>this time a child was born from the mouth of Kus4adh-
<>vaja. This child was the incarnation of Laks2mi1. With
<>the birth of the child Kus4adhvaja regained all the
<>wealth and prosperity he had lost. The child was named
<>Vedavati1 (Devavati1). She grew up and became a young
<>woman. Her desire was to get Maha1vis2n2u as her husband.
<>Once an asura named S4ambhu came to the hermitage
<>of Kus4adhvaja. When he saw Vedavati1 he fell in love
<>with her. He asked Kus4adhvaja for the hand of his
<>daughter, but Kus4adhvaja did not give his consent.
<NI>S4ambhu got angry. He came back in the night and kill-
<>ed Kus4adhvaja with his sword. Hearing the sound Veda-
<>vati1 woke up and saw the dead body of her father lying
<>in a pool of blood. She looked at S4ambhu angrily. In
<>that fiery look S4ambhu was burnt to ashes.
<NI>Vedavati1 began to perform very severe penance to get
<>Vis2n2u as her husband. It was at this time that Ra1van2a
<>had begun his campaign of conquest. He defeated all
<>kings and was proceeding victoriously through the
<>vicinity of the Hima1layas, when he saw the beautiful
<>damsel Vedavati1 sitting alone and performing penance.
<>Seeing so beautiful a girl engaged in penance, he told
<>her that he was the famous Ra1van2a with ten heads and
<>requested her to throw away the garment of bark of the
<>tree and the matted hair and to accept him as her
<>husband. She rejected his request. The angry Ra1van2a
<>caught hold of her hand. She resisted using her teeth and
<>finger-nails. She cried out that she wanted no more to
<>retain the body made impure by the touch of a wicked
<>person. She made a fire and jumped into it. Thus in
<>the sight of Ra1van2a, she burnt herself to death. Before
<>death she vowed that in the next birth Maha1vis2n2u would
<>become her husband and would kill Ra1van2a.
<NI>Ra1van2a who himself was burning in the fire of amour,
<>was extremely sorry at the death of the beautiful girl.
<>He took the ashes of hers to Lan3ka1 and put them in a
<>golden box and kept the box in a solitary place. He used
<>to visit the place daily. Since the arrival of the ashes,
<>bad omens began to occur in Lan3ka1. One day Na1rada
<>came to Lan3ka1. Ra1van2a asked Na1rada for the reason of
<>constant occurrences of bad omens in Lan3ka1. Na1rada
<>replied that the cause of bad omens was the golden box
<>he was keeping and that if it was kept in Lan3ka1 any
<>longer, it would cause destruction and that if it was
<>destroyed, great disaster would follow. Na1rada advised
<>Ra1van2a to remove the box without opening it to some-
<>where else outside Lan3ka1. Accordingly Ra1van2a caused
<>the golden box to be dropped in the sea. By and by it
<>came with the waves to the shore of Bha1rata (India).
<>Robbers took it and went to the north and hid it in a
<>forest. They were not able to take it away again. Thus
<>the box came to be deposited on the basin of a river in
<>Mithila1.
<NI>It was this river-basin that King Janaka selected as
<>the place for sacrifice. Being kept in this holy place,
<>the ashes of the body of Devavati1 in the box mingled
<>with her spirit and was taking shape into a child. When
<>the place was ploughed for preparing the spot of sacri-
<>fice, for Janaka, this golden box was discovered. The
<>child which was inside the box, was taken home and [Page721-b+ 64]
<>brought up by the king who named her Si1ta1. It was
<>the portion of this Si1ta1 herself that took birth next as
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a)
<NI>{%Other versions.%}
<NI>(i) The King Padma1ks2a performed penance before
<>Maha1vis2n2u with a view to get Maha1laks2mi1 as daughter.
<>Maha1vis2n2u gave the King a great Phallus to realize
<>his wish. From that a beautiful girl was born. The
<>King named her Padma1. When she attained marriage-
<>able age, the King made preparations for her Svayam3-
<>vara (the bride herself choosing a husband). On the
<>day fixed for the marriage Ra1ks2asas came and destroy-
<>ed all the preparations and killed King Padma1ks2a.
<>Because of her sorrow at this disaster Padma1 jumped
<>into the fire. The giants searched for Padma1 every
<>where, but they could not find her. They returned in
<>disappointment.
<NI>One day, during this period, Ra1van2a was travelling in
<>his Aerial chariot. When he reached this place, he
<>saw Padma1 who had come out of the fire. Ra1van2a was
<>fascinated by the beauty of Padma1. So he turned
<>towards her. Seeing this, Padma1 again jumped into
<>the pile of fire for safety. Without any delay Ra1van2a
<>made a search in the pile of fire. At last he got the
<>body of Padma1 (Si1ta1) in the form of five jewels. The
<>disappointed Ra1van2a placed the five jewels in a
<>box and took it to Lan3ka1 and gave it to his wife
<>Mandodari1. One day Mandodari1 opened that box
<>and saw Padma1 sitting in the form of a beautiful
<>virgin. Thinking that it was not propitious to keep
<>her who was the cause of destruction to Padma1ks2a, his
<>family and kingdom, Mandodari1 exerted pressure on
<>Ra1van2a to cast the box out of Lan3ka1. Ra1van2a with
<>his men took the box from Lan3ka1 and buried it in
<>Mithila1. Before the box was closed Padma1 cursed
<>Ra1van2a. “I will come to Lan3ka1 again to kill you and
<>your clan.”
<NI>One day when a brahmin of Mithila1 was ploughing
<>his field he got this box. Thinking that it belonged to
<>the King, the brahmin took the box to King Janaka.
<>The King took the child in the box and brought it up.
<>He named the child Si1ta1. (A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a, 7-6).
<NI>(ii) In Adbhuta Ra1ma1yan2a we see another story which
<>is somewhat different from that we see in A1nanda
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. It is given below:--
<NI>Ra1van2a who had become the harasser of the entire
<>world began to harass the hermits and sages also. He
<>used to shoot arrows at the hermits who were sitting in
<>meditation in the forests, and taking their blood in the
<>arrow-head, he stored it in a big pot. In the same
<>forest a hermit named Gr2tsamada was engaged in
<>penance to get a daughter who would be equal to
<>Laks2mi1 in everyway. He took milk with the head of
<>Darbha grass and stored it daily in a pot. One day
<>Ra1van2a came to his hermitage and took the pot of
<>milk stealthily. He poured the milk into the pot in
<>which he had stored the blood and stirring it well gave
<>it to his wife Mandodari1. Seeing the character of her
<>husband becoming worse and worse every day, Mando-
<>dari1 became miserable. One day she decided to
<>commit suicide and drank the contents of the pot
<>given by Ra1van2a. The thing which was taken for
<>suicide, made her pregnant. Mandodari1 buried that
<>foetus in Kuruks2etra. After a while a girl was born [Page722-a+ 65]
<>from it. That child was Si1ta1, the daughter of King
<>Janaka.
<NI>(iii) There is a story in Devi1 Bha1gavata stating how
<>Si1ta1 was born as the daughter of Ra1van2a. It is as
<>follows:
<NI>Ra1van2a wished to marry Mandodari1, the daughter of
<>Maya. Then Maya said to Ra1van2a thus:--“Accord-
<>ing to the horoscope of Mandodari1, the first child born
<>to her will be the destroyer of its clan. So it would be
<>better to kill that child.” Not acting upon the advice
<>of Maya, Ra1van2a put the first child in a box and
<>buried it in the city of King Janaka. This child was
<>Si1ta1, the wife of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Si1ta1 grew up in the palace of King
<>Janaka. Kus4adhvaja the younger brother of Janaka
<>had three daughters. They were named Ma1n2d2avi1,
<>U1rmila1 and S4rutaki1rti. Si1ta1 grew up along with these
<>three sisters. The four of them grew up as sisters and
<>friends. Si1ta1 grew up to be a young woman. Several
<>young men wished to marry her. Janaka refused
<>everyone of them. One day the princesses were play-
<>ing with their maids in the garden of the harem. Si1ta1
<>sat on the dais in the centre of the garden to make a
<>flower garland. All their attempts to gather the jasmine
<>flowers from the twigs of a large mango tree in the
<>garden ended in failure. S4i1ta1 instantly ran to the
<>weapon house and taking a bow and arrow, shot down
<>the flowers. The flowers fell down on the cloth placed
<>on the ground without being damaged. Janaka saw the
<>shooting of Si1ta1, from the palace. He was amazed at
<>the expertness of Si1ta1. The bow which Si1ta1 took was
<>S4aivaca1pa (the bow of S4iva). S4iva had used this bow,
<>in days of old, to destroy the sacrifice of Daks2a. S4iva,
<>who was pacified by the destruction of the sacrifice of
<>Daks2a and the victory over his enemies, gave this bow
<>to his devotee, the King of Videha. That King kept
<>the bow in his weapon-house and used to worship it.
<>S4i1ta1 had taken that bow and shot with it.
<NI>The King who had been thinking about the marriage
<>of Si1ta1 thought that what he saw was a good omen. So
<>the King made a proclamation that only he who could
<>take the bow of S4iva, draw it, and shoot with it would
<>become eligible to marry Si1ta1. Hearing this many
<>adventurers came to the palace and tried to handle the
<>S4aivaca1pa and retreated admitting defeat. It was at
<>this time that Vis4va1mitra brought Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>to the forest for the protection of sacrifice. Hearing
<>about the Svayam3vara of Si1ta1, Vis4va1mitra took the
<>princes to the palace of Janaka. The King was greatly
<>pleased when he learned that the princes were the sons
<>of Das4aratha, of the solar Dynasty. Next morning,
<>at the instruction of his elders and priests and teachers,
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma stood on the dais in the middle of the hall,
<>where the S4aivaca1pa was placed, ready to handle it.
<>He lifted up the bow with his left hand, drew it easily
<>and fastened the string tightly and the bow was broken.
<>When the Kings who were present, heard the roaring
<>sound of the breaking of the bow, they shivered with
<>fear as serpents at the sound of thunder. Si1ta1 jumped
<>with joy like a peacock. A letter was sent to Das4aratha
<>then and there. Friends and relatives arrived. Under
<>the guidance of the presiding priest S4ata1nanda, the
<>marriage ceremony was conducted. Ra1ma married
<>Si1ta1, Bharata married Ma1n2d2avi1, Laks2man2a married
<>U1rmila1, and S4atrughna married S4rutaki1rti. The brides [Page722-b+ 65]
<>and bridegrooms went to Ayodhya1 with their parents
<>and relatives. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Anasu1ya1's gift of clothes and ornaments.%} Das4aratha
<>who had become old, wished to hand over the realm to
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma. Since Kaikeyi1 stood as a hindrance, the
<>kingdom fell into the hands of Bharata. Moreover
<>Si1ta1 had to live in the forest with S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a for fourteen years. In the early period of
<>their forest-life they visited the hermitage of Atri.
<>Seeing the devotion of Si1ta1 towards her husband,
<>Anasu1ya1 the wife of hermit Atri, blessed her and
<>gave her a fine garland, clothes and ornaments and
<>cosmetics. Anasu1ya1 blessed Si1ta1 again and said that
<>she would shine as Laks2mi1 if she besmeared her body
<>with the divine cosmetics. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayodhya1
<>Ka1n2d2a, Sargas 118-120).
<NI>4) {%Test by Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara.%} In the last year of
<>forest-life Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara tested the firmness
<>of the love of Si1ta1 and Ra1ma. (See under Ra1ma, Para
<>14).
<NI>5) {%Phantom Si1ta1.%} A few days before the abduction of
<>Si1ta1 by Ra1van2a, Fire god took the guise of a Brahmin
<>and approached S4ri1 Ra1ma and said: “O, S4ri1 Ra1ma!
<>The Devas have sent me to tell you certain things
<>which will take place shortly. Your incarnation has
<>the aim of killing Ra1van2a. Si1ta1 is meant to be a cause
<>for the same. The death of Ra1van2a is imminent. He
<>will come and carry Si1ta1 away. So entrust Si1ta1 with
<>me. I will keep her carefully. Make a phantom
<>(Ma1ya1) Si1ta1 and keep her here, instead of the real
<>Si1ta1devi1. After the killing of Ra1van2a, when Si1ta1 enters
<>fire as a proof of her purity, I will return Devi1 Si1ta1.”
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma agreed to it. Fire god by his power of contem-
<>plation, created a phantom Si1ta1, exactly like the real
<>Si1ta1 in shape and figure and nature and placing her beside
<>Ra1ma, he disappeared with the real Si1ta1. Even Laks2man2a
<>was not aware of this fact. The real Si1ta1 Devi1 was under
<>the care of Fire god till the moment of the test of chastity
<>of Si1ta1 by fire, after the killing of Ra1van2a. During the
<>time of entering the fire the illusory Si1ta1 vanished in
<>the fire and the real Si1ta1 came out. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).

<NI>8) {%Si1ta1 in the hermitage of Va1lmi1ki.%} Abandoned Si1ta1, who
<>was pregnant, wandered about in the forest and at last
<>reached the hermitage of Va1lmi1ki, who gave her protect-
<>ion and shelter. The story of an occurrence at this
<>time is given in Katha1saritsa1gara, Alan3ka1ravati1lambaka,
<>Taran3ga 1.
<NI>The other hermits did not like Va1lmi1ki's action of giving
<>shelter to Si1ta1. They said “Si1ta1 is impure. Otherwise
<>her husband would not have abandoned her. By her
<>association we also would become sinners. As the hermit
<>Va1lmi1ki is kind, he will not cast her away especially
<>when she is pregnant. So the best thing for all of us, is
<>to go to another hermitage.” This murmuring of the
<>hermits reached the ears of Va1lmi1ki. He said “She is
<>pure and chaste. I know it with my inward eyes.” But
<>they did not believe it. Then Si1ta said “Lord! you can
<>test my chastity in whatever way you like, and if I am
<>found to be impure you may cut off my head.”
<NI>The hermits tested Si1ta1 in the T2it2t2ibhasaras (a
<>divine lake near the hermitage of Va1lmi1ki) and were [Page723-a+ 65]
<>convinced that she was chaste and pure. (See under
<>T2it2t2ibhasaras to know the greatness of this divine lake).
<NI>9) {%Cursed Si1ta1.%} Si1ta1 was spending miserable days in the
<>hermitage of Va1lmi1ki. Her matrimonial life was a hell.
<>Is there any special reason for misery? Yes. It is the
<>curse of a bird. Once S4es2a told this story, of the cursing
<>of Si1ta1 by a bird, to the hermit Va1tsya1yana. That story
<>is given below:
<NI>The event took place when Si1ta1 was a young girl in the
<>palace of Janaka. One day while Si1ta1 was playing in
<>the garden she saw two parrots, cock and hen, which
<>talked well. The spouses were delightfully engaged in
<>love-making. As soon as the couple saw Si1ta1 they flew
<>up to a tree and sang thus: “A handsome king will take
<>birth on the earth. His name will be S4ri1 Ra1ma. His
<>wife's name will be Si1ta1. Their wedded life will be
<>happy.
<NI>Hearing the song, Si1ta1 thought that they were some
<>divine persons, and asked her maids to catch them and
<>give them food. The maids caught the parrots and
<>brought them before Si1ta1. She asked the birds.
<>“Don't fear. Who are you? Where do you come from?
<>Who is that Ra1ma? Who is Si1ta1? How did you come to
<>know of them? Tell me all. I will not hurt you!
<NI>The birds replied. “In the forest there is a hermit named
<>Va1lmi1ki. We live in his beautiful hermitage. That
<>hermit has composed the story Ra1ma1yan2a, which is yet
<>to happen, and has taught it to his disciples. We have
<>heard those songs. Having heard them over and over
<>we also have learned them by heart. We will tell you
<>who Ra1ma is and who Ja1naki1 is and what would happen
<>to her who lives happily with him. Hear it! Saying
<>thus the parrots passed on to the story of Ra1ma. Due to
<>the sacrifice of the hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga, Maha1vis2n2u incar-
<>nated as four persons, of whom Ra1ma the eldest, with his
<>younger brother and Vis4va1mitra, would come to
<>Mithila1. He would draw the bow and marry Si1ta1...
<NI>Si1ta1 was extremely pleased with the sweet song of
<>the birds and asked them so many questions repeatedly
<>with curiosity. Seeing the excitement of the questioner
<>the parrots understood that she was Si1ta1 herself. They
<>asked her. “Beautiful girl! who are you? Why are you
<>so much interested in knowing about Ra1ma? What is
<>your name?” Si1ta1 disclosed everything about her to
<>the birds, and said “I am the same Si1ta1, the daughter
<>of Janaka you have sung about. I will let you go only on
<>the day when that handsome prince Ra1ma comes and
<>marries me. Your conversation has made me so curious.
<>You can live comfortably in my house, eating sweet-
<>meats.” The birds were in great fear when they heard
<>this. They looked at each other and replied to Si1ta1.
<>“Good child! we birds fly about in the sky and perch on
<>trees and bush. Houses are not comfortable to us. More-
<>over I am pregnant. After my delivery in our own place
<>I will come here. You need not have any doubt.” The
<>female parrot said thus. But Si1ta1 did not let them go.
<>Then the male parrot prayed humbly with anxiety.
<>“Si1ta1, allow her to go. Why do you detain my beauti-
<>ful wife? Allow us to have our own way in the forest.
<>My wife is pregnant. After the confinement both of us
<>will come back.” Si1ta1 said “Let her live with me. You
<>may go as you please.”
<NI>The parrots were in great sorrow. If they had not made
<>any noise on that tree this detention would not have
<>occurred. These pitiable supplications had no effect on [Page723-b+ 65]
<>Si1ta1. The male bird cried to Si1ta1 to let him take his
<>mate along with him, and beat his head on the ground.
<>Si1ta1 was adamant. The female bird, filled with misery
<>and anger cursed Si1ta1 thus. “You have separated me
<>from my husband. I am pregnant. May you too be
<>separated from your husband when you become preg-
<>nant”. When she had finished saying, she fell on the
<>ground and wriggled and died. An acrial chariot came
<>down to the earth from heaven for the soul of that bird
<>which had died exalting and glorifying S4ri1 Ra1ma. The
<>soul of the bird got into the chariot and went up to
<>heaven. The male bird, being unable to bear the death
<>of his beloved wife, dipped himself in the Gan3ga1. Before
<>his death he cried out in anger. “I must be born in the
<>city of Ra1ma. By my words, this Si1ta1 should be sepa-
<>rated from her husband and fall into misery.” He died
<>in the Ganges in Krodha (anger) and fear. So he took
<>rebirth with the name Krodhana as a washerman by
<>caste and profession. It was this washerman who spoke
<>words of calumny about Si1ta1. Due to the calumny of
<>this washerman, S4ri1 Ra1ma abandoned Si1ta1 and she
<>had to take shelter in the hermitage of Va1lmi1ki.

<>cease to be and become one with the cosmic power, and
<>that the trinity will be born again at the commence-
<>ment of the Kalpa and will take up their respective
<>functions.
<NI>The dominant quality or attribute of S4iva is Tamas
<>(darkness). Many stories, with slight variations, are told
<>in the various Pura1n2as about the birth of S4iva. Some
<>of the more important stories are summarised below.
<NI>(i) At the begining of the Kalpa, while Brahma1 was
<>meditating upon the birth of a son like himself, a child
<>deep blue in colour, appeared on his lap, and the child
<>began running about crying aloud. Brahma1 asked the
<>child why it was crying; then the child asked Brahma1
<>to give him a name. Though Brahma1 told him that
<>his name was Rudra and asked him not to cry, he
<>cried seven times more. Then Brahma1 gave him another [Page724-a+ 65]
<>seven names, and for the total eight names eight
<>Mu1rtis (forms) wives and children were allotted. Bhava,
<>S4arva, I1s4a1na, Pas4upati, Bhi1ma, Ugra and Maha1deva
<>were the additional seven names, and Sun, Water,
<>Earth, Wind, Fire, Sky, the Brahmin who has taken
<>di1ks2a1 and Moon were the eight Mu1rtis and the presiding
<>deities allotted to them. To these deities the following
<>wives were also allotted, i.e. Suvarcala1, Us2a1, Vikes4i1, S4iva1,
<>Sva1ha1, Dis4a1, Di1ks2a1 and Rohin2i1. The world is full with
<>their progenies. S4anais4cara, S4ukra, Lohita1n3ga, Mano-
<>java, Skanda, Sarga, Santa1na and Budha are the sons of
<>the above eight wives. This Rudra married Sati1, daugh-
<>ter of Daks2apraja1pati. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 8).
<NI>(ii) Brahma1 whose predominant quality or attribute
<>is rajas was born from the navel of Maha1vis2n2u. From
<>the Centre of the brow of Brahma1 was born Rudra of
<>Ta1masic quality. Brahma1, by the power of his tapas,
<>acquired the power of creation and created a red-col-
<>oured world by his attribute of rajas. The very same
<>world is annihilated by Rudra at the close of the Kalpa
<>period. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>(iii) From the wrath of Brahma1 was born Rudra, from
<>his lap Na1rada, from his finger Daks2a, from his mind
<>Sanaka and others, and from his left finger a daughter
<>called Vi1ran2i1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>(iv) Four ‘mental sons’ of Brahma1 Sanaka, Sanandana
<>Sana1tana and Sanatkuma1ra showed disinclination to
<>beget progenies. Brahma1 got angry at this attitude of
<>the four sons and from the centre of his brow was born
<>a body blue and white in colour, and he, in tears,
<>requested Brahma1 for names and stations. Blessing him
<>by saying ‘ma1 ruda’ (do not cry) Brahma1 allotted him
<>names and stations. He became famous by the name
<>Rudra. He was also given eleven more names by
<>Brahma1 as follows: Manyu, Manu, Mahinasa, Maha1n,
<>S4iva, R2tudhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Ka1ma, Va1madeva
<>and Dhr2tavrata. These names are otherwise famous as
<>follows: Aja, Ekapada, Ahirbudhnya, Tvas2t2a1, Rudra,
<>Hara, S4ambhu, T{??}ambaka, Apara1jita, I1s4a1na and Tri-
<>bhuvana. The eleven Rudras were also allotted the
<>following eleven positions by Brahma1 i.e. heart, the five
<>organs of the body, vital force (Pra1n2a) wind, fire,
<>water, earth, sun and moon. Rudra has eleven wives,
<>called Dhi1, Vr2tti, Us4ana1, Uma1, Niyuta1, Sarpis, Ila1, Amb-
<>ika1, Ira1vati1, Sudha1 and Di1ks2a1. Rudra, under the name
<>S4iva, is considered to be the third of the trinity. The
<>doctrine is that as long as time is real, deluge, or annihi-
<>lation does not take place. Therefore, Rudrasam3ha1ra
<>(annihilation by Rudra) may be taken to mean only as
<>the beginning of new creation.
<NI>(v) At the commencement of Yuga (era) Brahma1 was
<>born from the navel of Vis2n2u. Two asuras called Madhu
<>and Kait2abha rushed up to kill Brahma1, and from the
<>brow of Vis2n2u, who got angry towards the asuras was
<>born S4iva holding in his hands S4u1la (the three-pronged
<>trident). (Vana Parva, Chapter 12).
<NI>2) {%Family life.%} S4iva has two wives, Gan3ga1 and Pa1rvati1
<>(See under Gan3ga1 and Pa1rvati1). He lodges Gan3ga1 on
<>his head. Uma1, Ka1tya1yani1, Gauri1, Ka1li1, Haimavati1
<>I1s4vari1, S4iva1, Bhava1ni1, Rudra1n2i1, S4arva1n2i1, Sarvaman3gala1
<>Aparn2a1, Pa1rvati1, Durga1, Mr2d2a1ni1, Can2d2ika1, Ambika1,
<>A1rya1, Da1ks2a1yan2i1, Girija1, Menaka1tmaja1, Ca1mun2d2a1,
<>Karn2amot2i1, Carcika1 and Bhairavi1--these are synonyms
<>of Pa1rvati1. S4iva lives on the top of the Maha1meru,
<>where there are nine cities. At the centre is Brahma1's [Page724-b+ 63]
<>Manovati1; exactly to the east of it is Indra's Amara1vati1;
<>at the south-eastern corner is Agni's Tejovati1; on the
<>south is Yama's Sam3yamani1; at the south-western
<>corner is Kr2s2n2a1n5jana1 of Nirr2ti, on the west is Varun2a's
<>S4raddha1vati1, at the north-western corner is Gandha-
<>vati1 of Va1yu, on the north is Kubera's Mahodaya1, at
<>the north-eastern corner is S4iva's Yas4ovati1--this is the
<>set of the nine cities.
<NI>Two sons called Subrahman2ya and Gan2apati were born
<>to S4iva of Pa1rvati1, and they are his actual sons. Some
<>other sons also were born to him in his assumed forms
<>and by other women. Such have been Indrajit, Hanu1ma1n
<>and others. For details see the respective words. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha, 9th Skandha; Katha1sarit-
<>sa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka).
<NI>3) {%Incarnations.%} S4iva has taken several partial incar-
<>nations, the chief of which are given below.
<NI>(i) {%Durva1sas.%} (See under Durva1sas).
<NI>(ii) {%Va1nara (Monkey).%} S4iva, Pa1rvati1 and their attend-
<>ers like Nandikes4vara once transformed themselves into
<>monkeys and played about on the Hima1layas. Ra1van2a,
<>who came there on the occasion ridiculed Nandikes4vara,
<>who, in great rage, cursed Ra1van2a that monkeys would
<>destroy him. Being thus cursed Ra1van2a raised
<>Kaila1sa from its foundations and played with it.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(iii) {%S4akti.%} S4iva incarnated himself as S4akti, son of
<>Vasis2t2ha and was devoured by Kalma1s2apa1da, who
<>took the form of a Ra1ks2asa. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 6).
<NI>(iv) {%Varun2a.%} S4iva once assumed the form of Varun2a
<>and conducted a yajn5a which was attended by the
<>Vedas in assumed forms. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 85).
<NI>4) {%Boons granted by S4iva.%} The Pura1n2as refer to various
<>persons, who had earned boons from him and others
<>who attained heaven on account of their devotion for
<>him. The following are important among such persons.

<NI>5) {%Assets of S4iva.%} S4iva possesses a mass of matted hair,
<>red in colour. It is known as Kaparda also, and hence
<>he is called Kapardi1 as well. S4iva is also stated to be
<>Agni. He has three eyes, the third one on the forehead
<>being all fire. S4iva is called Trinetra, Pha1lanetra,
<>Agnilocana etc. because of the above facts. It is only
<>just and proper that S4iva, who is the destroyer of all
<>things should have relation to Agni. S4iva, the all-
<>destroyer, carries the S4u1la in his hands always. Another
<>weapon is named Pina1ka, and therefore S4iva is called
<>Pina1kapa1n2i (he who holds Pina1ka in his hands). Both
<>S4iva and his vehicle, the Bull, are white in colour. The
<>white colour indicates the justice observed in the
<>process of annihilation. S4iva has been described as
<>possessing two, four, eight and ten hands. Besides the
<>Pina1ka, he holds in his hands the club called Khat2va1n3ga,
<>the bow called Ajagava, a deer, beads, skull, d2amaru
<>(a musical instrument) and many other sacred articles.
<>Gan3ga1 and Candra (moon) dwell on his head, and he is,
<>therefore, known as Gan3ga1dhara and Candracu1d2a also.
<>A Garland made of human skulls adorns his neck. S4iva
<>wears the skin of the leopard for cloth and uses the skin
<>of the elephant for blanket. All over his limbs snakes
<>are worn as ornaments.
<NI>The Pura1n2as contain stories as to how S4iva earned most
<>of the above assets. The wives of many R2s2is felt ena-
<>moured of S4iva, who once appeared in the garb of a
<>beggar. The R2s2is, who got angry with S4iva on the
<>above account, decided to kill him. From the pit they
<>dug on the ground, a tiger emerged. S4iva killed it and
<>wore its skin. A deer followed the tiger from the pit.
<>S4iva held it in his left hand. The next to emerge out
<>of the pit was a red-hot iron rod. S4iva took it in his
<>hands as a weapon. Lastly snakes came out of the pit
<>and S4iva wore them on his body. On another occasion
<>an asura called Gaya assumed the form of an elephant
<>and chased the munis, who took refuge in a S4iva temple.
<>S4iva appeared, killed the elephant and wore its skin on
<>his body. Since S4iva wore snakes as ear-rings he came
<>to be known as Na1gakun2d2ala. Brahma1 ordered that
<>Rudra should create people and accordingly he created
<>people. But, his creations were very cruel beings.
<>Brahma1 feared that they would eat up the other creat-
<>ions. Brahma1, who trembled with fear, asked Rudra
<>to retire from the act of creation and to train himself
<>to do creation in the proper manner as ordained.
<>Accordingly, Rudra started practising tapas. [Page725-b+ 65]
<NI>6) {%Incidents.%}
<NI>(i) How S4iva got the name Ji1mu1taketu. (See under
<>Ji1mu1taketu).
<NI>(ii) {%He became Kapa1li1.%} (See under Kapa1li1).
<NI>(iii) {%Sin of Brahmahatya1 on S4iva.%} As he plucked off the
<>head of Brahma1 S4iva became subject to the sin of
<>Brahmahatya1. Blue in colour and with grey hair,
<>terrible Brahmahatya1 approached S4iva who asked
<>her who she was and why she came. She ans-
<>wered that she was Brahmahatya1 and asked S4iva to
<>take her into him. She entered his body so that he felt
<>a burning sensation all over him. In this condition S4iva
<>went to Ba1darya1s4rama. But, the great R2s2is, Narana1ra1-
<>yan2as were not there in the a1s4rama. Sad at heart S4iva
<>went to the river Yamuna1 to take a bath. But the river
<>dried up. Then he went to Plaks2a island to bathe; but
<>the island disappeared. Then he went to Pus2kara1-
<>ran2ya, Ma1gadha1ran2ya, Saindhava1ran2ya, Naimis2a1ran2ya,
<>Dharma1ran2ya etc. all to no purpose. He got worn out
<>but could not have a bath. The terrible Brahmahatya1
<>did not leave him. Though he visited sacred rivers,
<>a1s4ramas and temples and practised Yoga, S4iva did not
<>get redemption from sin. At last, in great disappoint-
<>ment he went to Kuruks2etra, where he saw Vis2n2u. With
<>folded hands S4iva praised Vis2n2u who advised him the
<>following means for absolution from sin. “A Bhagava1n
<>born from my aspect under the name Yogas4a1yi1 is
<>living at Praya1ga. The great river Varun2a1 which has
<>started from the right leg of Yogas4a1yi1 and which
<>redeems all sins as also the sublime river Asi1, which has
<>started from his left leg are both worshipped by the whole
<>world. The temple of Yogas4a1yi1 is at the centre of these
<>rivers, and that is a sacred place most important in the
<>three worlds and annihilative of all sins. That city is the
<>great Va1ra1n2asi1. Even materialistic or worldly people
<>get salvation there. It is my (Vis2n2u) a1s4rama. There
<>dwells Su1rya called Lola destroying all sins. The place
<>where Kes4ava my aspect lives, is Das4a1s4vamedha. If you
<>go there you will get redemption from sin.”
<NI>Thus directed by Vis2n2u S4iva went to Va1ra1n2asi1 and
<>achieved absolution from the sin of Brahmahatya1 by
<>bathing in the holy ti1rthas there. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 3).
<NI>(iv) {%Birth of Vi1rabhadra.%} (See under Daks2a),
<NI>(v) {%Water in Ka1lindi1 got dark in colour.%} (See under
<>Pa1rvati1, Para 2).
<NI>(vi) {%S4iva became Na1gabhu1s2an2a.%} (See under Na1ga1stram).
<NI>(vii) {%Blessed Sukes4a.%} Vidyutkes4a, the Ra1ks2asa married
<>Sa1lakat2an3ka1, daughter of Sandhya1. While they toured
<>the world round enjoying their honeymoon Sa1lakat2an3ka1
<>conceived and delivered in due course a son in the
<>valley of Mount Mandara. S4iva and Pa1rvati1, who pass-
<>ed that way in an aerial chariot saw the child and
<>came down to it. By the blessing of S4iva the child
<>grew up to a youth very quickly. S4iva named him
<>Sukes4a and after blessing that he would grow up to
<>become a pious soul disappeared from the scene.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(viii) {%S4iva, the father of Indrajit.%} (See under Indrajit,
<>Para 2).
<NI>(ix) {%Four faces of S4iva.%} (See under Tilottama1, Para 2).
<NI>(x) {%Sword of S4iva.%} S4iva holds a sword in his hand to
<>destroy the asura tribe. The following is told in
<>Chapter 166 of S4a1nti Parva about the origin of the
<>sword. [Page726-a+ 65]
<NI>Brahma1 when he created the universe also laid down
<>laws to keep living beings in the path of righteousness.
<>But, the asuras did not conform to those laws. So, the
<>mahars2is decided that there should be some other
<>means to instruct the asuras. They conducted a Brahma-
<>yajn5a at the Hima1layas. A terrible Jin (Evil Spirit)
<>emerged from the sacrificial pit.
<NI>At the emergence of the Jin the earth shook; the
<>great sea grew wild with waves and eddies. Lightning
<>and shooting stars appeared and branches of trees were
<>torn asunder. A vicious whirl-wind swept the ten
<>regions. All living beings trembled at the sight of the
<>Jin.
<NI>Brahma1 appeared to the frightened mahars2is and told
<>them that it was not a Jin, but only the sword for
<>the destruction of the asura tribe. S4iva took the sword
<>in his hand, and as soon as he touched it he became
<>possessed of four hands. “S4iva, whose head touched
<>the sun, who had the third eye and from whose mouth
<>flames of fire emerged, who changed himself to various
<>colours like blue, white and red, who wore deer skin
<>with golden spots, who had on his forehead an eye as
<>effulgent as the Sun--such S4iva took in his hands the
<>fiery sword and raising his shield he swirled the sword
<>in various directions.”
<NI>When S4iva, who thus became terrible, walked with the
<>sword amidst the asura army the entire asura forces
<>were annihilated and the Devas came out victorious.
<NI>7) {%Daring deeds of S4iva.%}
<NI>(i) {%Clash With Vis2n2u.%} Though there were differences
<>of opinion between S4iva and Vis2n2u on many occasions,
<>only very rarely had occurred actual clashes between the
<>two. The Pura1n2as refer to two such important clashes.
<>One has reference to a direct fight S4iva fought with
<>Vis2n2u and the other is about S4iva's fight with Na1ra1ya-
<>n2ars2i, an incarnation of Vis2n2u.
<NI>There was no reason for the direct fight between S4iva
<>and Vis2n2u. The Devas wanted to test who was the
<>more powerful of the two, S4iva or Vis2n2u, and they told
<>Brahma1 about the idea By carrying tales to them, one
<>against the other, Brahma1 made S4iva and Vis2n2u mutual
<>enemies. The enmity led to a fight between the two.
<>Vis4vakarman made a bow for each of the contestants.
<>In the fight between the two S4iva got defeated. S4iva,
<>who got angry at his temporary defeat presented his
<>bow and arrow to Devara1ta, King of Videha. It was
<>this bow, which S4ri1 Ra1ma broke at the wedding of
<>Si1ta1 in a later period. As soon as the fight was over
<>the Devas realised that Vis2n2u was greater than S4iva.
<>After the fight Vis2n2u gave his bow to R2ci1ka, the
<>Bha1rgava muni. Jamadagni got it from R2ci1ka, and he
<>gave it to Paras4ura1ma. It was with this bow that
<>Paras4ura1ma confronted S4ri1 Ra1ma on his way back
<>after wedding Si1ta1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Canto 75).
<NI>The following story is related in the Anus4a1sana Parva
<>of Maha1bha1rata about the fight between Na1rayan2ars2i,
<>incarnation of Vis2n2u and S4iva.
<NI>S4iva, in great fury, threw his S4u1la into the Yajn5a hall
<>of Daks2a, and the S4u1la after reducing the Yajn5a, to
<>ashes, hit the breast of Na1ra1yan2ars2i, who was doing
<>tapas in Badarika1s4rama. Na1ra1yan2a raised the sound
<>‘Hum’ as a result of which the S4u1la returned to S4iva's
<>hands, who, in great anger, rushed forward to Na1ra1yan2a.
<>Na1ra1yan2a placed his hand on S4iva's throat with the result [Page726-b+ 65]
<>that it became dark in colour. Thenceforth S4iva came
<>to be known as S4itikan2t2ha also.
<NI>Na1ra1yan2a plucked a blade of grass and recited some
<>mantras. It became a paras4u (axe). He threw it at
<>S4iva, who broke it into pieces, which act gave him the
<>additional name of Khan2d2aparas4u also. The fighting
<>became fierce and the world began burning. Fire
<>refused to receive offerings made; R2s2is could not
<>recollect the Vedas; Rajas and Tamas attacked Devas;
<>the earth shook; planets became dim and dark;
<>Brahma1 fell down from his seat; sky came down; oceans
<>got dry; the Hima1layas crumbled. On the continuous
<>appearance of such ill omens Brahma1 and all the
<>Devas came to the battlefield. Saluting Rudra Brahma1
<>told him thus: “Oh! Lord! Let good happen to the
<>world. In the interests of the welfare of the world. you
<>would please give up arms. The Narana1ra1yan2as are
<>upholders of righteousness; they are the incarnations of
<>the indestructible and supreme sages. I was born from
<>their pleasure. You were born from their wrath.”
<NI>On hearing these words of Brahma1 S4iva cooled down.
<NI>(ii) {%Rendered Ka1madeva bodiless (limbless).%} See under
<>Ka1madeva, Parva 4).
<NI>(iii) {%Bore Gan3ga1 on the head.%} See under Ga1n3ga1.
<NI>(iv) {%Consumed Ka1laku1t2a.%} Owing to the curse of
<>Durva1sas the Devas were subjected to symptoms of
<>old age, and to produce amr2ta (nectar) as remedy for
<>this unfortunate development, the churning of Ks2i1ra1-
<>bdhi (ocean of milk) was started. Va1suki, the snake,
<>was used as cord to rotate mount Mandara, which
<>was used as the churning rod. When the churning
<>became very intense, the mortal poison Ka1laku1t2a emerg-
<>ed out of Va1suki's mouth. (Another view is held that
<>Ka1laku1t2a rose out of the milk-sea). On the emergence of
<>the deadly poison the asuras ran off in great fear, the
<>Devas got bewildered, Ba1li and Sugri1va too got fright-
<>ened; and without exhibiting his fright Vis2n2u covered
<>his face; on the whole it appeared as though the entire
<>world would be reduced to ashes.
<NI>At this critical moment, S4iva, reputed for his reckless
<>daring, put all the Ka1laku1t2a into his mouth. Frightened
<>at it Pa1rvati1 held S4iva's throat by her hands so that
<>the poison did not enter his stomach. At the same
<>time Maha1vis2n2u covered with his hands S4iva's mouth
<>so that the poison was not spitted out. Ka1laku1t2a thus
<>prevented from going down into the stomach or being
<>vomited from S4iva's throat got itself digested in the
<>throat giving it a blue colour. Thus did S4iva become
<>Ni1lakan2t2ha (of the blue throat). Vis2n2u and Pa1rvati1
<>who were affected by the flames of the poison became
<>Ni1lavarn2a and Ka1li1 respectively. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a).

<NI>(vii) {%Burned the Tripuras.%} (See under Tripura).
<NI>(viii) {%Fought Su1rya.%} S4iva once plucked out Brahma1's head
<>(See under Kapa1li1 1), and Brahma1 cursed S4iva that he
<>should beg for food with that head (skull) in his hands.
<>This fierce curse of Brahma1 affected S4iva so much that,
<>in uncontrollable wrath, he beat whomsoever he met.
<>Thousands of Devas and others were killed. Su1rya, who
<>relished not these atrocities of S4iva confronted him with
<>out-stretched hands. S4iva held with one hand of his,
<>both the hands of Su1rya from the fingers of which
<>blood began to flow. S4iva turned Su1rya round and [Page727-a+ 65]
<>round by his hands with the result that the hands of
<>Su1rya became short. When Su1rya became completely
<>drenched in blood S4iva let him free and walked to
<>another side when Su1rya, laughingly challenged him
<>again to fight. Greatly enraged by the challenge S4iva
<>fisted him on the face with the result he lost all his
<>teeth. Also he fell down unconscious. As Su1rya fell
<>thus Bhaga looked with fierce eyes at S4iva, who then
<>sturck the former on his face, Both the eyes of Bhaga
<>fell down and the Devas were alarmed by it. Then all
<>the A1dityas, under the leadership of Indra ran off to the
<>ten regions along with the Maruts and Agni. Only
<>prominent asuras like Prahla1da remained on the scene.
<>They saluted S4iva. S4iva surveyed the ya1ga hall, the
<>Devas and the asuras with his three eyes. All of them
<>then ran away to different places. S4iva looked at the
<>three Agnis with his three eyes and they were reduced
<>to ashes.
<NI>When S4iva's anger subsided Su1rya was installed in his
<>former form. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 5).
<NI>(ix) {%Fought with Andhaka.%} See under Andhaka.
<NI>(x) {%Made five Indras Pa1n2d2avas.%} The Pa1n2d2avas, in their
<>former life, were Indras. (A1di Parva, Chapter 199).
<NI>The Devas once conducted at Naimisa1ran2ya a lengthy
<>yajn5a of which Yama was the manager. In the absence
<>of Yama there was no death on earth. Thus, human
<>beings also, like the Devas, became Amartyas (death-
<>less). Alarmed at this the Devas submitted their
<>grievance to Brahma1 who pacified them by saying that
<>Yama would return as soon as the yajn5a was over and
<>then men will, as usual be subjected to the process of
<>death. The Devas then returned to Naimis2a1ran2ya,
<>the scene of their yajn5a when they saw a woman,
<>lustrous as fire, descending the steps of Gan3ga1 to
<>carry water. She was sobbing and each drop of tear
<>that fell into the waters of the river transformed itself
<>into a lotus flower. As deputed by the Devas Indra
<>approached the woman to get facts from her.
<NI>Indra asked her who she was and why she was weeping.
<>The woman answered him not, but walked in silence,
<>to the source of the Gan3ga1. Indra followed her. When
<>they had thus walked some distance S4iva and Pa1rvati1
<>were found in the forest at a game of dice, and Indra,
<>afraid of S4iva, ran way. But, S4iva called him back and
<>asked him to enter the cave there. When Indra did so
<>after removing the mountain at the entrance of the cave
<>he saw four Indras sitting there. They were called
<>Vis4vabhuk, Bhu1tadha1ma1, S4ibi and S4a1nti. The woman
<>whom Indra had followed was S4ri1devi1. S4iva blessed that
<>the five Indras, in their next birth, would wed S4ri1devi1.
<>When the Indras saw Maha1vis2n2u after this he also
<>blessed them, and promised them that he would incar-
<>nate and help them when they were born as men in
<>their next life. Then Vis2n2u plucked a black and a
<>white hair and put them on earth. The black hair
<>was born as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in Devaki1's womb and the white
<>hair as Balabhadrara1ma in the womb of Rohi1n2i1.

<NI>(xiv) {%Burnt Himava1n.%} S4iva once did tapas on the top of
<>Himava1n when Pa1rvati1 came behind him and covered [Page727-b+ 65]
<>his eyes with her hands. At once darkness enveloped
<>the whole world, and when people suffered in the
<>absence of day-light S4iva opened his third eye.
<>Himava1n began getting burnt by the fire emitted by
<>S4iva's eye. Pa1rvati1 got alarmed at this and woke S4iva
<>up. He closed his third eye and Himava1n resumed its
<>former shape. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 104).
<NI>8) {%Worship of S4iva.%} Innumerable people in India
<>worship S4iva and they follow different forms or systems
<>of worship. There are forms of worship which follow
<>the Vedas and which do not as also forms which are
<>sa1ttvic and which are not. The form of worship called
<>Paras4upadam (? Pa1s4upatam) is a very ancient one. It is
<>believed that the Paras4upadas once honoured and after-
<>wards opposed the Vedas. The S4iva lin3ga at the place
<>called Gu1d2amillam is supposed to be as old as the
<>second century B.C.
<NI>One of the many symbols, which represent S4iva, S4ivalin3ga
<>is the most important. They are of two kinds, the
<>movable and the immovable. The immovable are those
<>which appear by themselves or installed in temples. The
<>movable are those made of earth, stone, timber, gems
<>etc. There are also temporary lin3gas, which are placed
<>on stools of various shapes. Lin3gas are made of he-stones
<>and stools of ‘she-stones’.
<NI>There are also various types of lin3gas indicative of the
<>different attributes of S4iva; for example Lin3godbhava,
<>Candrasekhara, Raudra, Uma1sahita etc. Ka1ma1ntaka,
<>Gaja1ri, Ka1la1ri, Tripurada1haka etc. represent the Lord
<>in his fierce aspects. S4iva is also represented in poses of
<>blessing Can2d2es4a, Vis2n2u, Nandi1s4vara, Vighnes4vara and
<>Arjuna. He is also presented in various poses of dancing,
<>Daks2in2a1mu1rti is represented in four forms, i.e. Vya1khya1na
<>Jn5a1na, Yoga and Vi1n2a1dhara. Biks2a1t2aka, Kapa1ladha1ri1.
<>Gan3ga1dhara, Ardhana1ri1s4vara Vr2s2abhava1hana and
<>Vis2abhaks2aka are other forms of S4iva. Rarely is he depict-
<>ed in the form of Sada1s4iva, Mahes4vara, Eka1das4arudras
<>Vidyes4vara and Mu1rtyas2t2aka. There are A1gamas descrip-
<>tive of these forms.
<NI>Gan2apati occupies the most prominent place among
<>Devas connected with S4iva. Gan2apati came to be wor-
<>shipped from 6-7 centuries B.C. His present idols might
<>have been made after this period.
<NI>There are many temples dedicated to Gan2apati in South
<>India. Chief among the idols are it2am3piri (proboscis
<>turned to the left side) and valam3piri (proboscis turned
<>to the right side). Gan2apati is a physical aspect of
<>S4iva. Being the God who removes obstacles in the
<>devotee's path, Gan2apati is called Vighnes4vara. The
<>universe is contained in his big stomach.
<NI>Next to Gan2apati in importance is Subrahman2ya. He
<>is worshipped in South India only. Kuma1ra, Muruka,
<>Ka1rttikeya, Skanda, A1rumukha, Guha, etc. are some of
<>his popular synonyms There are a number of Subrah-
<>man2ya temples in Tamil Na1d2u, many of them on the
<>tops of hills. In North India Subrahman2ya temples are
<>rare. But, books written during the San3gha period go
<>to prove that Subrahman2ya was worshipped in South
<>India from very olden times. He is depicted in many
<>postures, sitting, with six faces, with only one face, with
<>two hands, with four hands, with wife, wearing the
<>sacred thread etc.
<NI>Now, about S4akti idols. S4akti is the Devi1 closest to S4iva.
<>In South India there are special S4akti temples called
<>S4aktipi1t2ha1layas. Durga1 is the most important among [Page728-a+ 65]
<>the manifestations of S4akti. There are idols of Durga1s
<>as standing in the lotus flower and also as mounted on
<>the lion. A1gamas refer to nine kinds or forms of Durga1
<>i.e. Ni1lakan2t2hi1, Ks2eman3kari1, Harasiddhi, Raudra1, Vana1,
<>Agni, Jaya1, Vindhyava1sini1, and Ripuna1s4ini1. Durga1's
<>most terrible form is as Mahis2a1sura-mardini1, found at
<>Maha1balipuram, Ellora and other places. Durga1 is also
<>called Can2d2ika1 and Ka1tya1yani1. Durga1 is worshipped as
<>Nanda1, Bhadraka1li1, Amba1, Ra1jama1tan3gi1 etc.
<NI>9) {%S4iva's life-period.%} Thousand Caturyugas constitute
<>one day of Brahma1. According to the Pura1n2as fourteen
<>Indras fall dead from heaven during the life time of one
<>Brahma1. Two such life times of Brahma1 form one life
<>time of Vis2n2u; at the end of the period he too will
<>expire. S4iva's life time is double that of Vis2n2u, accord-

<NI>15) {%S4ivabhasma (Ashes worn by S4iva)%} The Pura1n2as
<>contain many references to the great power of S4ivabha-
<>sman. The following story about even Vis2n2u turning
<>out to be a devotee of S4iva on account of the sanctity of
<>S4ivabhasma is related in Chapter 101, Pa1ta1lakhan2d2a of
<>Padma Pura1n2a.
<NI>In the beginning or during the Brahmapralaya (deluge)
<>Maha1vis2n2u was lying in the great waters of the deluge.
<>On both sides of Vis2n2u hundred universes each and on
<>both sides of his feet and at the centre of his head twenty
<>universes each remained attached. One universe glowed
<>as a gem on Vis2n2u's nose. Mahars2is like Lomas4a did
<>tapas seated on his navel. Meanwhile Vis2n2u sat in deep
<>meditation ready for creation. But, he did not find
<>anything and began, therefore, sobbing. Then appeared
<>an extra-mundane light at which he got frightened and
<>closed his eyes. S4iva, rotating in both his hands a
<>garland each made of a crore of universes appeared
<>before Vis2n2u. He then stood up and enquired of the
<>visitor who he was. S4iva exhibited his form. S4iva told
<>Vis2n2u that he had not attained sufficient wisdom for
<>creation and also advised him to achieve enough know-
<>ledge by first taking the Varun2a bath and then the
<>Bhasma bath.
<NI>To this Vis2n2u answered by saying that there was no-
<>where water enough for him to bathe, and he, who was
<>closely surrounded by universes, sat in water. But, it
<>came only up to his thighs. Then S4iva said laughingly
<>that there was enough water for Vis2n2u to bathe and
<>cast a glance at him with his (S4iva) eye on the fore-
<>head and also his left eye. And, immediately Vis2n2u's
<>body became very small and it began to shiver. Then
<>S4iva said as follows:-“Oh! Vis2n2u! here is deep water.
<>you may bathe in it. But Vis2n2u could not get into the
<>tremendous pool created on S4iva's lap. So, he requested [Page728-b+ 65]
<>S4iva for a passage to get into the pool. S4iva “Oh!
<>Vis2n2u! Before this even though you sat in water, one
<>crore yojanas in depth, it came only up to your thighs.
<>But, now though you are on your legs you say you can-
<>not enter the water. Look here, the water comes only
<>up to my thighs. You may descend into it. I shall see
<>to it that you can step into the water. A Vedic saying
<>I recite will serve as the step.”
<NI>Vis2n2u:--Nobody can step on sound. One may ascend
<>on what is material, i.e. with form; but, how could one
<>step on that which is formless?
<NI>S4iva:--Why can you not get hold of that which is and
<>ascend? You receive this great Veda.
<NI>Vis2n2u received it, but it appeared that his hands were
<>not strong enough to hold it. S4iva smiled at the inabili-
<>ty of Vis2n2u and asked him to get down into water by
<>the steps made of Veda and when Vis2n2u descended the
<>steps into the water, it came only up to his thighs. He
<>had his bath and then asked S4iva what he should do
<>next. S4iva:--“What do you feel in your mind? Is it
<>that you do not feel anything”
<NI>Vis2n2u:--I feel not anything.
<NI>S4iva:--If you get sanctified by bhasmasna1na you will
<>receive the ultimate knowledge. I shall give you the
<>bhasma.
<NI>S4iva took a pinch of bhasma from his breast and chant-
<>ing the Ga1yatri1 and pan5ca1ks2ara (Om namas4s4iva1ya)
<>mantras sprinkled it all over the body of Vis2n2u. He
<>also said to Vis2n2u, “You live, you meditate, now what
<>do you feel in your mind?” Vis2n2u meditated whereupon
<>he saw a very bright light in his heart. When he told
<>S4iva that a light was being seen by him the latter
<>said that his knowledge was not mature enough and
<>asked him to eat some bhasma so that it might become
<>perfect. Vis2n2u accordingly consumed the bhasma, and
<>lo! he, who was till then red-blue in colour became
<>as white as pearl. He began to be called S4uklavarn2a
<>(white in colour) from that day onwards.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u felt happy and contented having seen S4iva,
<>who asked the former what it was he saw in his mind
<>just then. Answering that he saw the blissful form of
<>S4iva before him Vis2n2u fell at the latter's feet. To S4iva's
<>query as to what boon he desired to have, Vis2n2u replied
<>that he wanted to become a devotee of S4iva and because
<>of the greatness of the bhasma Vis2n2u thenceforward
<>became a devotee of S4iva.
<NI>16) {%S4ivalin3ga (Phallus).%} Worship of S4ivalin3ga is a
<>popular practice in India. The Pura1n2as contain a
<>number of stories about the importance Sivalin3ga
<>achieved so as to make it an object of worship. Three
<>of the more important stories are given below:
<NI>(i) S4iva wandered about the world lamenting over the
<>death of Sati1devi1 at the Yajn5a conducted by Daks2a,
<>and Ka1madeva followed him with his erotic arrows to
<>exploit S4iva's sorry predicament. During his wanderings
<>S4iva once came to the Vindhya mountain. Ka1madeva
<>followed him there too and began attacking S4iva with
<>his arrows and to escape from the fierce onslaught S4iva
<>took refuge in the terrible Da1ru forest. There Mahar-
<>s2is with their wives lived. S4iva saluted them and re-
<>quested for alms. But, the Mahars2is only kept mum. They
<>did not like their wives saluting S4iva. S4iva went about
<>the a1 rama and all the women except Arundhati1 and
<>Anasu1ya1, followed him overcome by lust for him.
<>Enraged at this, munis like Bha1rgava and An3giras cursed [Page729-a+ 65]
<>S4iva that his phallus should drop to the ground. Immedi-
<>ately it fell down and S4iva disappeared. The phallus
<>rent asunder the earth, reached Pa1ta1la and rent the
<>universe also. The whole universe shook at which
<>Brahma1 met Vis2n2u at Pa1ta1la and enquired of him the
<>reason for the universal upheaval. Vis2n2u answered him
<>that the world shook because of the weight of S4iva's
<>phallus, which the mahars2is had caused to be dropped.
<>Then Brahma1, along with Vis2n2u, came to the spot
<>where S4iva's phallus lay. At the sight of the limitless
<>phallus Vis2n2u, in great wonder, descended to Pa1ta1la
<>mounted on Garud2a. Brahma1, on his plane, toured
<>above. Both Vis2n2u and Brahma1 returned to earth,
<>having failed in their attempt to find the end of the
<>phallus. They then praised S4iva, who appeared to them.
<>They requested him to take back his phallus from the
<>earth. S4iva insisted that he would do so only if the
<>Devas agreed to worship his phallus. Vis2n2u agreed to
<>the suggestion. Brahma1 took the phallus, golden
<>brassy in colour. Thereafter Maha1vis2n2u created
<>the four castes and various s4a1straic texts for each of the
<>castes to worship the phallus. The four texts are known
<>as S4aivam, Pa1s4upatam, Ka1ladamanam and Ka1pa1likam.
<>After making the above arrangements Brahma1 and
<>Vis2n2u returned. S4iva took back his phallus. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<NI>(ii) Eightyeight thousand Ba1lakhilyas were born from
<>the mind of Brahma1. They emaciated their bodies by
<>constant baths, fasting and worship of S4iva. Though
<>they worshipped S4iva thus for one thousand divya years,
<>he did not appear in front of them.
<NI>Afterwards, when Pa1rvati1 was travelling by sky one day,
<>the latter saw and took pity on the Ba1lakhilyas and told
<>S4iva thus: “These mahars2is are suffering like anything.
<>For my sake, you should put an end to their sufferings.
<>Has their evil fate no end? They are reduced to mere
<>skin and bones, and yet they are denied realisation.”
<>Smilingly S4iva told Pa1rvati1 as follows “You do not know
<>the real course of righteousness. These people do not
<>understand righteousness; they are not free from lust
<>and anger. They are mere fools.” At these words of
<>S4iva, Pa1rvati1 told him thus: If things be as you have
<>said please show me their nature, I feel interested. Then
<>S4iva asked Pa1rvati1 to remain where she was, telling her
<>that he would go to the Ba1lakhilyas and show her how
<>they behaved. Accordingly S4iva went to them.
<NI>S4iva approached the Ba1lakhilyas in the guise of a hand-
<>some youth, wearing the Vanama1la1 garland on his
<>head, holding the alms bowl in his hands and complete-
<>ly in the nude and requested for alms. The Women-
<>folk of the Advaitins were much attracted by the hand-
<>some youth and came to him with a lot of fruits, roots
<>etc. by way of alms. S4iva wished them good and
<>Pa1rvati1 espied her smiling lord from her seat.
<NI>After giving him alms the women spoke to him as
<>follows: “Oh! anchorite, what penance are you
<>practising? You have no clothes on you, but you wear
<>Vanama1la1. You are a handsome sannya1si1. If you
<>have no objection, please tell us about you.” The
<>sannya1si1 (S4iva) answered them by saying that his was
<>a very secret penance and could not be imparted to
<>others. Especially in the presence of so many others it
<>could not be revealed. So, you may please go. But,
<>the women said that they wished very much to hear the
<>secret, and they caught hold of his hands saying ‘Come’. [Page729-b+ 65]
<>The women were overcome by lust and one of them
<>caught hold of his neck, another of his hands, another
<>of his knees, another of his hair and yet another of his
<>waist. Seeing the excitement of their wives the mahar-
<>s2is cried, ‘Strike him’ and struck down his phallus
<>with sticks and stones. As soon as the phallus was
<>thus felled down, S4iva disappeared from the spot and
<>returned to Kaila1sa with Pa1rvati1.
<NI>When the phallus fell down the whole universe shook
<>and the mahars2is were alarmed. A very intelligent
<>mahars2i among them said:--“We know not the real
<>facts about the great ascetic. Let us take refuge in
<>Brahma1. He may know the facts.” Accordingly the
<>mahars2is went to Brahma1, who found fault with their
<>ignorance and indiscretion and asked them to shed
<>their anger and please S4iva. Accordingly they went to
<>Kaila1sa and praised S4iva, who appeared to them and
<>told them as follows:--“You may now return. The
<>phallus will belong to you. I shall be pleased if you
<>would duly install it. Nothing will be impossible
<>to those who worship my phallus with devotion. Even
<>sins consciously committed will be removed by the
<>worship of my phallus. You install the phallus you
<>struck down in the great pond of Sannihita. That
<>will achieve for you all your desires. Even the Devas
<>will worship it under the name ‘Stha1n2u’. Being install-
<>ed at Stha1n2vi1s4vara it will be known as Stha1n2vi1s4vara
<>also. Constant meditation upon Stha1n2u will remove
<>all sins. The sight of Stha1n2u will bring about salva-
<>tion.”
<NI>After this the mahars2is, along with Brahma1, returned
<>to Da1ru forest to carry the phallus to Sannihita. But,
<>they could not move it even by an iota. They returned
<>again to Kaila1sa, but could not see S4iva there. When
<>Brahma1 sat in meditation for sometime to know where
<>S4iva was, he saw in his mind S4iva, in the guise of an
<>elephant, standing in the stream praised by munis.
<>Immediately Brahma1 and others went there, but missed
<>S4iva there. But Pa1rvati1 appeared there and served
<>them amr2ta (nectar). When they had consumed the
<>nectar they saw S4iva standing in the stream, and they
<>spoke about their difficulties to him.
<NI>S4iva, in the guise of the elephant, accompanied them to
<>the Da1ru forest where he, in sport, took the phallus
<>by his proboscis and installed it on the banks of
<>the stream. All those who witnessed the installa-
<>tion attained ultimate realisation. Upon the phallus
<>thus installed Brahma1 built another phallus with stone.
<>After a period that phallus became one with the
<>effulgence of the first phallus. Those who saw that also
<>achieved ultimate realisation. Immediately Brahma1
<>built, for the pleasure of the Devas, seven phalluses
<>one upon the other, and sages attained ultimate realis-
<>ation by smearing their bodies with the dust of the
<>phalluses. The spot where the phallus was installed
<>became famous by the name Stha1n2uti1rtha. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 45).
<NI>(iii) In the beginning Brahma1 entrusted S4iva with
<>the duty of creation and to earn the power for creation
<>he lived under water for many generations. S4iva
<>having not returned though Brahma1 waited for him
<>long, the latter created the praja1patis and got done by
<>them all creations. Then it was that S4iva, having
<>acquired all the more power, came out of water. S4iva
<>who got angry that all creations were effected in his [Page730-a+ 65]
<>absence plucked his phallus and threw it into the
<>earth. He said that, since matters of creation had been
<>managed by Brahma1, he needed the phallus no further.
<>The phallus thus thrown by S4iva stuck to the earth
<>and remained pointed upwards. Next, S4iva performed a
<>dance of annihilation among the Devas. Ultimately, on
<>the request of the Devas S4iva deposited his fire of wrath
<>in water. It is that fire which dries up water in seas,
<>rivers etc. When S4iva had shed his anger and become
<>quiet the Devas worshipped the phallus, which had
<>stuck to the earth, and thenceforth worship of S4iva's
<>phallus became popular. (M.B. Sauptika Parva, Chap-
<>ter 17).

<>The brahmin took his dead child to the burning ghat
<>when a fox asked him to wait at least till dusk to see
<>if the child would regain life. At the same time a
<>vulture, which came there pointed out to the brahmin
<>that the dead never came back to life and asked him to
<>leave the dead body there and return home. As advised
<>by the fox and the vulture the brahmin took to the
<>burning ghat and took back from there the dead body
<>of his child. Pa1rvati1 took pity on the brahmin and as
<>requested by her S4iva brought the child back to life.
<>The logic and reasoning advanced by the fox and the [Page731-a+ 65]
<>vulture for their selfish ends is famous under the name
<>Gr2dhragoma1yusam3va1da.

<HI>S4IVARA1TRI1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} S4ivara1tri1 is a holy day. S4ivara1tri1 is observed
<>on the eve of New moon day (Caturdas4i1) falling in the
<>middle of Ma1gha and Pha1lguna (February-March).
<>During this night, penance should be done with
<>fasting. On Caturdas4i1 day penance (vrata) should be
<>observed without sleep and food and S4iva worshipped.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} There is the following Pura1n2ic story about
<>the origin of the observance of S4ivara1tri as a sacred day.
<>Brahma1 took his birth in the lotus that originated from
<>the navel of Vis2n2u. Brahma1 trying to know the source
<>of the lotus saw Vis2n2u only. He asked, ‘Who are you?’
<>and was answered ‘I am Vis2n2u, your father’. That
<>answer did not satisfy Brahma1 and a quarrel ensued
<>between him and Vis2n2u which ended in fighting.
<>Brahma1 shot the Brahma1stra, which Vis2n2u countered
<>with Pa1s4upata1stra and neither of the two was able to
<>withdraw it, which went round the world. While both
<>stood aghast not knowing what to do, S4ivalin3ga appeared
<>betwixt the two. Both the ends of the lin3ga were invisi-
<>ble. To find the ends Brahma1 went upwards and Vis2n2u
<>downwards. Though they travelled a great distance
<>they could not find out the ends, and, so, returned to their
<>old seats. Immediately S4iva appeared betwixt the two
<>and withdrew the pa1s4upata1stra. It was on Caturdas4i1 day
<>in the month of Ma1gha that S4iva thus appeared. S4iva
<>enjoined that in future Caturdas4i1 night every year
<>should be observed as a holy day, which should be
<>known as S4ivara1tri. (Kan2n2as4s4a Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%The greatness of S4ivara1tri.%} The following story about
<>a sinner, who attained S4ivaloka by observing S4ivara1tri
<>is related in S4ivara1trima1ha1tmya.
<NI>A son named Sukuma1ra was born to the Brahmin mana-
<>ger of the king of Kun5jara, a kingdom on the banks of
<>river Sindhu. The boy grew up to be an immoral fellow
<>and he married a Can2d2a1la girl with whom he lived for
<>seven years. Five daughters and two sons were born to
<>him of the Can2d2a1la woman. The father, Sukuma1ra,
<>himself married the daughters. One day he, in the
<>course of his search for a flower to be worn on the hair
<>of the Can2d2a1la woman, came near the S4iva temple cal-
<>led Na1ges4vara. A S4ivara1tri festival was being cele-
<>brated there that day and Sukuma1ra, participated in it.
<>Shortly afterwards Sukuma1ra died. Messengers of Ka1la
<>and S4iva arrived to carry off his soul and a battle
<>ensued between the two for the soul. His soul attained
<>S4ivaloka as he had, though by accident, participated in
<>S4ivara1tri festival.
<HI>S4IVAS4ARMAN. A brahmin well-versed in all s4a1stras
<>(sciences). S4ivas4arman, who lived in Dva1raka1 had, by
<>his wife Gun2avati1 five sons called Yajn5as4arman, Veda-
<>s4arman, Dharmas4arman, Vis2n2us4arman and Somas4ar-
<>man, all of them deeply devoted to their father. The
<>father decided to test the devotion of each of the sons. [Page732-a+ 65]
<>S4ivas4arman had, due to S4iva's blessing, achieved all
<>kinds of siddhis (spiritual gifts). By the power of illusion
<>he showed the sons their mother lying dead and all the
<>sons wept uncontrollably. Then he asked his eldest son
<>Yajn5as4arman, to cut the dead body of his mother into
<>pieces and throw them off. After having done so he came
<>and saluted his father.
<NI>After bidding adieu to Yajn5as4arman, who proved his devo-
<>tion to his father as above, S4ivas4arman called his second
<>son Vedas4arman to him and told him thus: “I find it
<>difficult to get on without a woman. Look, there is a
<>beautiful woman there endowed with all qualifications.
<>(And he created such a woman by illusion). You go and
<>fetch her to me.” Vedas4arman, after saluting his father
<>went to the woman and requested her to become the
<>wife of his father. But, the woman did not want to
<>become the wife of an old man, and she told Vedas4ar-
<>man that she would love him, and not his father, to
<>have as her husband. He shuddered to be told thus,
<>and by the power of his tapas he got down Indra and
<>other Devas on earth and showed them to her. She
<>then told him in indifferent tone the following: “Yes, I
<>have seen the prowess of your tapas. But, I have nothing
<>to do with Devas. If you want me as wife for your
<>father, please cut off your head with your own hands
<>for my pleasure.” Vedas4arman drew his sword and
<>very happily cut off his head and presented it to the
<>woman. She came to S4ivas4arman and requested him to
<>accept his son's head, which he (son) had voluntarily cut
<>off for the sake of his father.
<NI>The other sons of S4ivas4arman shuddered at the sight of
<>their brother's head. They told among themselves thus:
<>“Our mother entered eternal Sama1dhi, but this brother
<>of ours, who courted death on behalf of father is really
<>blessed.” Then S4ivas4arman asked his third son Dharma-
<>s4arman to receive his brother's head. He received it
<>and went out with it and prayed to Dharmadeva, who,
<>on his appearance, was requested to restore Vedas4arman
<>to life. Dharmadeva did so, and the first question
<>asked by Vedas4arman, who returned to life as though
<>awakened from sleep, was about the woman, whom he
<>had brought as his father's wife. Then Vedas4arman
<>and Dharmas4arman returned to their father, and Dharma-
<>s4arman told the father about his bringing back to life
<>his dead brother. Though the father felt very happy
<>about the great devotion of his son he did not answer
<>him (son).
<NI>S4ivas4arman fell into contemplation for sometime and
<>then told his fourth son, Vis2n2us4arman as follows: “You
<>go immediately to Indraloka and bring amr2ta (nectar)
<>for me to drink along with this woman. Nectar removes
<>diseases. Now, this woman has no interest in me. It is
<>only natural that young, beautiful women will feel no
<>love towards an old man and unless I regain my youth
<>this woman of mine may sleep with others. You, my son,
<>should act in such a manner that I can enjoy life with
<>this woman in all the three worlds.
<NI>As soon as he heard his father, Vis2n2us4arman, by the
<>power of his tapas ascended to the sky and started for
<>Indraloka. Being told about the object of his visit Indra
<>deputed Menaka1 to make him withdraw from the plan.
<>Immediately Menaka1 put on her best clothes and sing-
<>ing sweet music occupied the hanging seat in Nanda-
<>navana, and Vis2n2u arman lost not a minute to divine
<>the object of her presence. Without even casting a look [Page732-b+ 65]
<>upon her, he hurried forward. But, she jumped down
<>from her seat, blocked his path and made enquiries
<>about him. She also tried to make love to him. But,
<>Vis2n2us4arman turned down her overtures of love. At
<>this stage Indra adopted many magical tricks to frighten
<>away the unwelcome visitor. Angered by such attempts
<>Vis2n2us4arman got ready to destroy Devaloka along with
<>Indra, who then begged pardon of him and handed
<>over to him a pot full of nectar.
<NI>When Vis2n2us4arman gave the nectar to his father the
<>latter asked him to choose any boon he wanted, and
<>according to his request the father brought back to life
<>Gun2avati1. Now S4ivas4arman very much pleased with his
<>sons sent the first four of them to Vis2n2uloka. He decided
<>to live for some time more on earth with his youngest son,
<>and he told the latter that he was going on a pilgrimage
<>and asked him to keep the pot of nectar with him. The
<>son kept it very carefully for ten years. Now S4ivas4arman
<>with his wife returned from pilgrimage. By magic he
<>had become a leper, and made his wife also a leper.
<>Somas4arman, his youngest son felt pained that his
<>parents had fallen victims to such a fell disease and
<>served them with meticulous care in every way. He
<>foresaw their wants and desires and satisfied them to the
<>full. Yet, the father lost temper with the son and used
<>even to fist him. But, the son did not lose his temper
<>in any manner and to the least degree. He continued
<>to serve his parents most cheerfully.
<NI>A century was over in this manner. The parents were
<>greatly satisfied and pleased with their son, and ulti-
<>mately the father cast one more illusion on the son.
<>After stealing away by magic the nectar from the pot,
<>he asked the son for it. When Somas4arman looked into
<>the pot for nectar, to his horror it was missing. But, he
<>took the pot to his father saying to himself, ‘Let there
<>be nectar in it if I am truthful, if I have served my
<>elders well and if I have observed pure tapas’, and lo!
<>the pot was filled with nectar.
<NI>S4ivas4arman blessed his son, and by the power of his
<>yoga ascended to Vaikun2t2ha in the company of his wife.
<>After this Somas4arman began practising the most in-
<>tense form of tapas. When the time for his death was
<>near asuras approached him. Fear about asuras gripped
<>him, who was in deep meditation, and as he breathed
<>his last thinking about asuras he was born in his next
<>life as Prahla1da, son of Hiran2yakas4ipu and got killed by
<>Vis2n2u in the war between Devas and Asuras. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mi Khan2d2a).

<>their father they went to Pa1t2ali1putra for education.
<>The teacher gave his two daughters in marriage to
<>them. By the blessing of goddess Laks2mi1, Ka1lanemi
<>became rich in course of time and he was also blessed
<>with a glorious son. Since he was given by the
<>blessing of Laks2mi1 (S4ri1) he was named S4ri1datta.
<NI>S4ri1datta grew up and became an expert in archery.
<>Ka1lanemi's younger brother, Vigatabhaya left home
<>and went on a pilgrimage after his wife's death by
<>snake-bite. Ka1lanemi's king, Vallabhas4akti was pleased
<>with S4ri1datta and invited him to live in the palace.
<>In this way, he became the intimate friend of the
<>king's son, Vikrama S4akti. After that, Ba1hus4a1li and
<>Vajramus2t2i, the princes of Avanti1 became the friends
<>of S4ri1datta. Maha1bala, Vya1ghrabhat2a, Upendrabala
<>and Nis2t2hu1raka, who were the Minister's sons, also
<>sought the protection of S4ri1datta.
<NI>One day, S4ri1datta along with Vikramas4akti and other
<>companions went to bathe to the banks of the Gan3ga1.
<>While they were there, the party of friends began to
<>engage in some amusements. S4ri1datta assumed the role
<>of a king and the others posed as his subjects.
<>Vikramas4akti, the king's son, could not tolerate it. He
<>challenged S4ri1datta for a fight. In the fight Vikrama-
<>s4akti was defeated. But he secretly resolved to kill
<>S4ri1datta by hook or by crook. Sri1datta understood his
<>secret plan.
<NI>After leaving Vikramas4akti, S4ri1datta was walking with
<>the others along the river-bank when he saw a woman
<>struggling for life because she was caught in a whirlpool
<>in the middle of the river. S4ri1datta at once left his
<>companions and jumped into the river and swam up
<>to her. When he was almost within reach of her hair
<>the woman sank into the water. S4ri1datta also sank and
<>followed her, but after some time, he found neither the
<>woman nor even water. He found himself in a S4iva
<>temple. He offered worship there and took rest in a
<>park close by. The next morning a woman came to
<>worship in the temple. When she returned after
<>worship, S4ri1datta followed her. The woman who was
<>alarmed, walked faster and at last reached a heavenly
<>abode. She entered the house and took her seat on a
<>cot inside. S4ri1datta also got in and sat near the cot.
<>Many other women came and stood around her.
<>Without any apparent reason she began to cry. S4ri1datta
<>who was puzzled, asked her why she was crying. She
<>replied to him in the following words:--
<NI>“I am the grand-daughter of the Asura king, Maha1bali.
<>I am the eldest of his one thousand grand-daughters.
<>My name is ‘Vidyutprabha1’. Vis2n2u has captured and
<>imprisoned our grandfather, Maha1bali. He has also
<>killed our father in battle. After that he has expelled
<>us all from our Capital city. To prevent us from
<>entering it again, he has posted a lion as sentry [Page736-a+ 65]
<>at the palace gate. That lion is a Yaks2a who was cursed
<>by Kubera. If any one defeats him, he would be libe-
<>rated from his curse. By defeating that lion, you will
<>get a divine sword. With that you can defeat anyone.”
<>As soon as he heard this story, S4ri1datta rushed towards
<>the lion. In the fight that followed, the lion was de-
<>feated and it was suddenly transformed into the old
<>Yaksa. Pleased with the hero who was instrumental in
<>lifting his curse, he gave S4ri1datta a sword called “Mrga1n3-
<>kaka” and then disappeared. Vidyutprabha1 entered the
<>palace, accompanied by her sisters and S4ri1datta. She
<>gave a ring to S4ri1datta which had the power to destroy
<>the effects of poison. She fell in love with him. She
<>asked him to take a bath in the tank close by after giving
<>the sword to her, and undertook to kill any crocodile
<>which might attack him. S4ri1datta, keeping the sword
<>in his own hand, stepped into the water and sank into
<>it. But he rose up in the river Gan3ga1 into which he
<>had jumped earlier. He reached the bank of the river
<>and went in search of his companions. On the way, he
<>met with Nis2t2hu1raka. In the course of their talk,
<>Nis2t2hu1raka informed S4ri1datta that, Vallabhas4akti passed
<>away and Vikramas4akti was then ruling over the coun-
<>try. The new king had killed Ka1lanemi and was on
<>the look-out for murdering S4ri1datta. Both of them
<>resumed their journey and when they reached Ujjayini1,
<>they met with the rest of their friends. On their way,
<>a woman joined their party. She had lost her way
<>while going to the land of Ma1lava. S4ri1datta and Nis2t2h-
<>u1raka walked in the company of that woman and at
<>last they arrived at a deserted city. They spent the
<>night in that city. During the night when S4ri1datta
<>happened to wake up, he saw to his horror, that the
<>woman had killed his friend Nis2t2hu1raka and was eating
<>his flesh. S4ri1datta at once drew his sword and caught
<>hold of her hair and was about to cut off her head when
<>she was transformed into a Ra1ks2asa woman. She prayed
<>to him not to kill her and told him her story. She had
<>become a Ra1ks2asa woman by a curse. Long ago Vis4va1-
<>mitra did tapas to obtain Kubera's place. At that time
<>Kubera sent her to break Vis4va1mitra's tapas. Since she
<>failed in her attempts to attract him by her charms, she
<>tried to subdue him by assuming the form of a terrible
<>monster. The sage thereupon cursed her to become a
<>Ra1ks2asa woman with that figure. He declared that the
<>curse would be lifted when S4ri1datta grasped her hair.
<>She added that she had been killing and eating the
<>inhabitants of that city for a long time and that explain-
<>ed why the city had become deserted. Now that she was
<>liberated from the curse, she asked S4ri1datta what boon
<>he wished to have.
<NI>He replied that he only wanted his friend to be restored
<>to life. After reviving Nis2t2hu1raka, she disappeared.
<>Early next morning they reached Ujjayini1. There, they
<>met their old friends, Ba1hus4a1li1 and others. S4ri1datta
<>described to them his experiences after sinking in the
<>Gan3ga1.
<NI>Later, once when S4ri1datta went to a festival, he happened
<>to meet Mr2ga1n3kavati1, daughter of a King named S4ri1-
<>bimbaki. They fell in love with each other. When she
<>left the place, S4ri1datta felt very much depressed. Ba1hu-
<>s4a1li1 and others also knew about it. They offered to take
<>him to Mr2ga1n3kavati1. But just then she fell down un-
<>conscious, bitten by a snake. S4ri1datta soon restored her
<>with the help of the magic ring which Vidyutprabha1 [Page736-b+ 65]
<>had given him earlier. After that he returned with his
<>friends to Ba1hus4a1li1's house, leaving behind the ring
<>with Mr2ga1n3kavati1. The King who was deeply grateful
<>for the cure of his daughter sent plenty of wealth and
<>gold to S4ri1datta. But S4ri1datta gave all of them to
<>Ba1hus4a1li1's father. He was always doting on Mr2ga1n3ka-
<>vati1 and was much pained at his separation from her.
<>At this stage, the princess's favourite maid came to him
<>on the pretext of returning the magic ring and informed
<>him that Mr2ga1n3kavati1 was also pining for him and was
<>even prepared to die for his sake. S4ri1datta sent her
<>back with a secret message of love and cheer. After that
<>in consultation with his friends he made a plan to take
<>the princess secretly to Mathura1puri1. On the next day,
<>Ba1hus4a1li1 with three of his friends left for Mathura1
<>pretending to go there for trade. He made all arrange-
<>ments on the way for the secret conveyance of the
<>princess. That night, S4ri1datta sent a woman and her
<>daughter to the palace after making them senseless with
<>heavy drink and arranged for their sleeping there. As
<>directed by S4ri1datta, Bha1vanika set the palace on fire
<>and slipped out of the building with the princess. S4ri1-
<>datta sent them at once to Mathura1puri1. The woman
<>and her daughter who were burnt alive in the palace
<>were supposed to be the maid and the princess. S4ri1datta
<>set out to Mathura1 to meet Mr2ga1n3kavati1. On the way
<>he saw several evil omens. On arrival at Vindhyavana,
<>he saw his friends lying helpless, after having been
<>severely beaten up by unknown enemies. They informed
<>him that a stranger leading a powerful army over-
<>powered them and galloped away on horseback, taking
<>the princess with him.
<NI>S4ri1datta immediately started in pursuit of the unknown
<>enemy. Shortly after, he caught sight of the army led
<>by a Ks2atriya prince who was taking Mr2ga1n3kavati1 on
<>horseback with him. After a fierce fight, S4ri1datta
<>rescued the princess from the youth, captured his horse
<>and rode on it with her towards his friends. When they
<>had gone a short distance, the horse which had been
<>wounded in the battle, fell dead on the way. At that
<>time he went in search of water to quench their thirst,
<>leaving Mr2ga1n3kavati1 at the spot. By the time he
<>returned with water, the sun had set. So he lost his
<>way and wandered about in the forest till day-break
<>when he reached the place where he had left Mr2ga1n2ka-
<>vati1. But she was not seen anywhere there. To get a
<>better view of the neighbourhood in the hope of finding
<>her, he climbed to the top of a tree near by, after placing
<>his sword on the ground. Just then a hunter named
<>S4abara came that way and took up S4ri1datta's sword.
<>S4ri1datta saw this, but he got down from the tree and
<>instead of attacking him, merely asked him whether he
<>knew about the whereabouts of Mr2ga1n3kavati1. To this
<>S4abara said that he thought that she had reached his
<>cottage and asked S4ri1datta to accompany his followers
<>to the cottage. He also offered to go with him and
<>promised to return his sword after reaching there.
<NI>S4ri1datta reached the cottage with them. Being utterly
<>exhausted, he fell into a deep slumber. When he woke
<>up he found that his legs were chained together. While he
<>was lying thus, a woman named Mocanika1 approached
<>him and said:--“Why did you come here to court
<>death? S4abara has now gone out on some business. As
<>soon as he returns he will offer you as a sacrifice to
<>Bhadraka1li1. It is for that purpose that he has brought [Page737-a+ 65]
<>you here and put in chains. But there is yet one way
<>of escape for you. This S4abara has a very beautiful
<>daughter. She has fallen in love with you. If you marry
<>her everything will turn out well.”
<NI>For his own safety, S4ri1datta married S4abara's daughter
<>according to the Ga1ndharva method. Shortly after, she
<>became pregnant. Her maid Mocanika1 informed her
<>mother all about it. That kind and affectionate mother
<>came to S4ri1datta and said:--“S4abara is a very cruel
<>man. If he comes to know of this, he will never forgive
<>you. Therefore you must leave the place at once, but
<>you should never forget my daughter.” With these
<>words she took leave of him. S4ri1datta disclosed the story
<>of that sword to her and started on his journey again,
<>in search of Mrga1n3kavati1. From a hunter whom he
<>happened to meet on the way, he came to know that she
<>was living in a place called Na1gasthala near Mathura1,
<>under the protection of Vis4vadatta a Bra1hman2a.
<NI>S4ri1datta at once went to Vis4vadatta's house and made
<>enquiries about his wife. Vis4vadatta informed him that
<>he had entrusted her with a Bra1hman2a who was the
<>minister and priest of King S4u1rasena. He suggested
<>that S4ri1datta should stay with him that day and they
<>could proceed to S4u1rasena's place next morning.
<NI>S4ri1datta accordingly stayed there and started for
<>Mathura1 at day-break on the next day. On the way
<>he took bath in a tank just outside the city. While bath-
<>ing he happened to get a silk cloth and a necklace of
<>beads from the bed of the tank. After his bath, he
<>entered the city with the silk and necklace. Mistaking
<>him for a thief, the police arrested him. Really the silk
<>and necklace had been hidden in the tank by thieves.
<>S4ri1datta was produced before the King with the stolen
<>articles. The king condemned him to death. Mr2ga1n3-
<>kavati1 who was staying in the custody of the minister
<>happened to see S4ri1datta being taken to the place of
<>execution. She immediately ran up to the minister and
<>told him that S4ri1datta was her husband. When the
<>King came to know it, he ordered him to be brought
<>back to the palace. As soon as S4ri1datta saw the minister,
<>he felt certain doubts about his identity. The minister
<>had a striking resemblance to his father's brother
<>Vigatabhaya who had left home years ago. His doubts
<>were confirmed when the minister revealed his identity
<>and the two embraced each other after their long
<>separation. S4ri1datta narrated the whole story of his
<>sufferings and misfortunes beginning from the murder
<>of Ka1lanemi up to that time. On hearing his tragic
<>story, the minister burst into tears and told him that he
<>had received a boon from a Yaks2i1 by which he had
<>obtained 5000 horses and plenty of wealth. All this he
<>gave to S4ri1datta and his wife.
<NI>The king of that country had a daughter. S4ri1datta's
<>next plan was to marry her also. Vigatabhaya gave
<>him the necessary help. The minister took her with
<>S4ri1datta and his friends on the pretext of offering wor-
<>ship at the temple in Avanti1. They had to encounter
<>a band of robbers on the Vindhya mountain. S4ri1datta
<>was overpowered and the robbers plundered all their
<>wealth. Vigatabhaya and others were captured.
<>S4ri1datta was taken to be sacrificed to Bhadraka1li1. When
<>he was about to be sacrificed, his wife, the daughter of
<>S4abara arrived there with her son. It was within the
<>territory of S4ri1can2d2a. She stopped the robbers from
<>performing the sacrifice and returned to her own house [Page737-b+ 64]
<>with S4ri1datta. The Can2d2a1la band took Vigatabhaya and
<>others to S4ri1datta and they were released. After the
<>death of King S4abara, S4ri1datta became the King of
<>that wood. He got back his sword Mr2ga1n3kaka. He
<>married the daughter of S4u1rasena. S4ri1datta's friends
<>also came there. All of them joined together and killed
<>Vikramas4akti in a battle. After that S4ri1datta was crown-
<>ed king of the whole country up to the ocean. (Katha1-

<HI>SR2N5JAYA I.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Somadatta.
<NI>2) {%General information.%} A king of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<>His father was S4viti. This king S4viti was also called
<>S4vitya King. On the death of his father Sr2n5jaya became
<>king.
<NI>The hermits Na1rada and Parvata were friends of Sr2n5-
<>jaya. Once both of them came and lived in the palace
<>of the King as his guests. Sr2n5jaya had a beautiful
<>daughter named S4ucismita1. Both Na1rada and Par-
<>vata loved her. One day Na1rada directly asked Sr2n5- [Page738-b+ 64]
<>jaya, for the hand of his daughter. Parvata got angry
<>at this and cursed Na1rada that he would not attain
<>heaven. Na1rada retorted with the same curse. Sr2n5jaya
<>pacified both.
<NI>Sr2n5jaya had no sons. He informed the hermits of this
<>sad state. Na1rada blessed the king and said that a son
<>named Suvarn2as2t2hi1vi1 would be born to him and that
<>with his birth everything in the palace would become
<>gold. Accordingly the son Suvarn2as2t2hi1vi1 was born to
<>Sr2n5jaya and everything in the palace became golden.
<>When the son became four years old, by the sorcery of
<>Indra the child died. Na1rada brought him to life again.
<>(See under Suvarn2as2t2hi1vi1).
<NI>The fact that gold was accumulating in the palace of
<>Sr2n5jaya due to the boon given to Suvarn2as2t2hi1vi1, reached
<>the ears of robbers. One night they carried the child
<>away, and killed him. Then only did they come to
<>understand that there was no gold inside him. Sr2n5jaya
<>cried aloud at the loss of his son. To pacify the King,
<>Na1rada and Parvata told him stories of sixteen kings.

<>ched Paras4ura1ma and then saw Bhi1s2ma and persuaded
<>him to marry Amba1. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>175, Stanzas 15 to 27).
<HI>SR2S2T2I (CREATION). The Indian theory of creation
<>is given below:
<NI>1) {%Trigun2as%} (The three attributes). The base of the
<>universe is the set of the three attributes. They are
<>Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia).
<>Only things which could be seen, possess these three
<>attributes. Things which could be seen are perishable.
<>The indestructible could not be seen. Shape or form
<>is an attribute. God has no form. So god is without
<>attributes. The God devoid of attributes can be realised
<>by knowledge, but cannot be seen with the ordinary
<>eyes. The three attributes have a power each. Know-
<>ledge is the power of Sattva, activity, the power of Rajas
<>and reason the power of Tamas.
<NI>2) {%The five elements.%} From the divine power of Tamas,
<>five senses came into being, such as sound, touch, form,
<>taste and smell. Sound is the attribute of ether; touch,
<>the attribute of air; form, the attribute of fire; taste, the
<>attribute of water; and smell, the attribute of earth.
<>These are the minute senses or essentials. These five
<>senses having the divine powers, joined together with
<>the five minute essentials, make up the attribute of
<>Tamas. [Page739-a+ 65]
<NI>From the attribute of Sattva having the power of
<>knowledge, the ten essentials, such as air, the Sun,
<>Pa1s4i1 (Varun2a) two As4vini1-gods, Candra (Moon),
<>Brahma1, Rudra, Ks2etrajn5a and mind, came into being.
<>From these essentials the formation of five matters took
<>place. They are the five elements. When vigour
<>enters the quintupled elements, egoism is given a form.
<>This vigour with perceptible body is called A1di Na1ra1-
<>yan2a (Primordial Na1ra1yan2a). Anyhow, quintupled
<>elements will be bright with firm attributes. Ether has
<>the attribute of sound only. Air has the attributes of
<>sound and touch. Fire has the three attributes of sound,
<>touch and form. Water has the four attributes of sound,
<>touch, form and taste, and earth has the five attributes
<>of sound, touch, form, taste and smell. The variegated
<>expression of these five elements is called the universe.
<>It is stated in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 3, that the
<>number of species of living beings found in the universe
<>is eightyfour lakhs.
<NI>3) {%The embodied three (Trinity).%} It has been mentioned
<>in the last section how the three attributes came into
<>existence and how the five elements originated from the
<>three attributes and how vigour or energy acted upon
<>the five elements and A1di Na1ra1yan2a or Vis2n2u came into
<>being. In this section the birth of the three divine figures
<>is being dealt with.
<NI>In the known beginning, on the surface of the wide
<>waters, covering the universe made of the five elements,
<>Maha1vis2n2u lay on a banyan tree, as a child. “Who am
<>I? How was I made, and what for? What have I to
<>do?”, and so on were the thoughts of the child. Ins-
<>tantly a voice from the ether fell into his ears saying,
<>“I am everything. There is nothing eternal except me.”
<>Maha1vis2n2u lay contemplating on the voice he heard,
<>when Maha1devi1 appeared before Maha1vis2n2u and said
<>thus:--“Lo! Maha1vis2n2u! Whenever the universe
<>required creation, preservation and destruction, by the
<>potentiality of the Omnipotence or the Brahman with
<>no attributes, you too had taken origin. Understand
<>that the Omnipotence is beyond attributes. We all are
<>within the purview of attributes. Your attribute mainly
<>is Sattva. From your navel, will be born Brahma1 with
<>Rajas as his main attribute and from the forehead of
<>that Brahma1, S4iva with Tamas as his main attribute
<>will be born. By the power of penance, Brahma1 will
<>acquire the power of creation and with the help of the
<>attribute of rajas, he will create a world of the colour
<>of blood. You will be the protector and preserver of
<>that world, and at the end of the Kalpa (world-age)
<>S4iva will destroy that world. I am that power of purity,
<>which stands as help and assistance to you in creation.”
<>Accordingly, Brahma1 was born from the navel of Vis2n2u
<>and S4iva was born from the forehead of Brahma1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 1).
<NI>4) {%Creation. Sprouts, Animals and Humanity.%} After the
<>birth of the Trinity, while Brahma1 was contemplating
<>on creation, some creations of the attribute of Tamas
<>originated from him unknowingly. It was Avidya1
<>(Ignorance), having mertia, desire, great desire, dark-
<>ness and great darkness as its five branches. That god
<>continued his contemplation. Then five kinds of immov-
<>ables without the power of knowledge or brightness in
<>and out alike, and with souls covered with darkness,
<>originated. As these immovables are said to be promi-
<>nent, the creation of them is called prominent creation. [Page739-b+ 65]
<>These are called Sprouts (Udbhids). Seeing that this
<>creation was not sufficient, the god again sat in
<>contemplation. This time animals having horizontal
<>back bones and organs of sense were created. They
<>were called tiryaksrotas, as they walked horizontally.
<>They, such as cow etc. are having more of the attributes
<>of darkness and less of knowledge. They traverse
<>wrong paths due to lack of knowledge though they think
<>otherwise. Egoism, pride and twentyeight kinds of
<>incapacities are their qualities. Though they possess
<>knowledge inwardly they do not know each other.
<>Thinking that this creation also was not sufficient,
<>Brahma1 again engaged himself in contemplation, and
<>there came out another creation. It was called ‘U1rddhva-
<>srotas’ (flowing upwards). This third creation
<>having the attribute mainly of Sattva moved in a lofty
<>level. Those who were born in this creation, desired
<>for comfort and pleasure and were with the light of
<>knowledge inwardly and outwardly. When the third
<>creation called Devasr2s2t2i (creation of gods) originated
<>from Brahma1 he grew happy and contented.
<NI>Even after creating thus much, Brahma1 did not feel
<>satisfaction. So he made the creation of ‘Arva1ksrotas’
<>(moving downwards). The creatures of this group were
<>having the attributes of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas in an
<>advanced degree. So they are miserable and full of
<>activity. They are human beings.
<NI>Thus having completed the creation of Udbhids
<>(Sprouts), Tiryaks (animals) and Arva1ks (human beings)
<>Brahma1 passed on to the creation of heavenly beings.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1; Chapter 5).
<NI>5) {%Creation. Night, Day, Evening, Morning.%} After this
<>Brahma1 again sat in contemplation for water-creation
<>which is the creation of Devas, Asuras, Pitr2s and
<>Manus2yas (Gods, Demons, the Manes and Man). As
<>he was sitting in contemplation, the attribute of
<>Tamas (inertia) advanced in him and the asuras
<>(demons) were born from his loins. Then Brahma1
<>discarded the figure of Tamas in him. That discarded
<>figure of darkness became the night. Next, from the
<>face of Brahma1, the Devas (gods) were born. They
<>were having the attribute of Sattva (purity). Brahma1
<>discarded that figure of purity also. That figure
<>became the bright day. So the asuras are powerful in
<>the night and the Devas are powerful in the day. After
<>this, the manes were born from Brahma1. They were
<>also discarded. They became the evening between the
<>day and night. Then Brahma1 assumed the figure
<>having the attribute of Rajas. From this, man, who
<>was having more of the attribute of rajas was born.
<>Brahma1 discarded that figure also. It became a very
<>shining thing which is called the Dawn. So men
<>are powerful in the dawn and the manes are powerful
<>in the evening. The four creations of Day, Night,
<>Evening and the Dawn are considered to be the bodies
<>of Brahma1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 5).
<NI>6) {%Creation. Ra1ks2asas (Giants), Yaks2as (Demi-gods),
<>Serpents, Devils, Gandharvas%} Brahma1 again assumed
<>another figure having the attribute of Rajas. Due to
<>this Brahma1 felt hungry. Along with hunger desire
<>also grew in him. Then the Praja1pati (Lord of
<>Emanation) sat in the darkness and created some
<>creatures which were very hungry. Uncouth with
<>plenty of hair on the face, they ran towards Brahma1.
<>Of them those who said, ‘don't do so, save him’ [Page740-a+ 65]
<>became Ra1ks2asas (giants). Those who said “We will
<>eat him”, became Yaks2as, (demi-gods). Because of
<>Yaks2an2a (Bhaks2an2a-Food), they got the name Yaks2a.
<>Because of the dislike at seeing these creatures the
<>hair had fallen from the head of Brahma1. They crept
<>back again into his head. Because they did ‘sarpan2a’
<>(creeping up) they were called sarpas (serpents) and
<>as they were ‘Hi1na’ (fallen) they were called Ahis
<>(serpents). After this the Lord of creation became
<>very angry and created some creatures. Because of
<>their colour which was a mingling of red and black,
<>they were horrible and they became pis4ita1s4anas (those
<>who eat flesh). Then Brahma1 began to sing and from
<>his body the Gandharvas were born. Because they did
<>‘dhayana’ (Appreciate) of ‘go’ (word) when they were
<>born, they were called Gandharvas.
<NI>7) {%Creation. Birds, animals.%} After creating all these creat-
<>ures, Brahma1 created birds, from his ‘vayas’ (strength),
<>as free agents, according to their actions in the previous
<>lives. Then Brahma1 created sheep from his breast and
<>goats from his face. From his stomach and flanks he
<>created cows, and from his legs he created other creat-
<>ures such as the horse, elephant, donkey, wild bull, deer,
<>camel, mule, antelope etc. He created plants bearing
<>fruits and bulbs from his hairs. Though Brahma1 had
<>created vegetables and animals at the beginning of the
<>Kalpa (world-age), they came to be properly used in
<>sacrifices only from Treta1yuga (one of the four ages)
<>The animals such as the cow, sheep, goat, horse, mule
<>and donkey are called domestic animals and flesh-eaters
<>such as the leopard, animals with forked hoof such as
<>the wild bull, elephant, monkey, birds, and other
<>animals and reptiles, are included in the word ‘wild
<>animals’.
<NI>8) {%Creation-The Vedas etc.%} After having completed crea-
<>tion of the things mentioned above, the Praja1pati created
<>from his face looking to the east, the Vedic metre
<>Ga1yatri1, R2gveda, Trivr2tstoma, the sa1ma song called
<>Rathantara and the sacrifice called Agnis2t2oma; from
<>his face looking to the south, Yajurveda, the Vedic metre
<>Trais2t2ubha, Pan5cadas4a stoma. Br2hatsa1ma and the sacri-
<>fice Uktha; from his face looking to the west, Sa1maveda,
<>the Vedic metre Jagati1, Saptadas4astoma, Vairu1pasa1ma
<>and the sacrifice Atira1tra. Thus all the creatures lofty
<>and lower originated from the body of Brahma1. After
<>having created Devas, Asuras, the manes and men,
<>Brahma1 again at the beginning of the world age, created
<>Yaks2as, Devils, Gandharvas, celestial maids, Naras,
<>Kinnaras, Raks2as, cows, birds, animals, serpents etc.
<>such as have long life and short life, movable and immo-
<>vable, that we see in the world. Creatures which are
<>created again and again do perform functions which
<>creatures of their kind had been doing previously.
<>Habits of killing or not killing, kindness or cruelty,
<>righteousness or evil, truth or falsehood are adopted by
<>them as becoming to their kind in previous lives. It was
<>Brahma1 who had created the uses and differences seen
<>in the sense organs, elements and bodies. Brahma1 took
<>from the Vedic voice the shape, form, name, activities
<>etc. of various creatures such as the Devas etc. and
<>allotted them to each particular kind. So also he allotted
<>names, work etc. to hermits as seen in the Vedas.
<NI>9) {%Creation of the four castes.%} See under Ca1turvarn2ya.
<NI>10) {%Creation of Praja1patis.%} When Brahma1 saw that the
<>subjects he had created, did not flourish, he created first [Page740-b+ 65]
<>the Sanaka brothers and the mental sons of Bhr2gu,
<>Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, An3giras, Mari1ci, Daks2a, Atri
<>and Vasis2t2ha, and gave these nine the name Praja1patis
<>(Lords of Emanation). Then he created nine women
<>named Khya1ti, Bhu1ti, Sambhu1ti, Ks2ama1, Pri1ti, Sannati,
<>U1rja1, Anasu1ya1. and Prasu1ti and gave in marriage
<>Khya1ti to Bhr2gu, Bhu1ti to Pulastya, Sambhu1ti to Pulaha,
<>Ks2ama1 to Kratu, Pri1ti to An3giras, Sannati to Mari1ci,
<>U1rja1 to Daks2a, Anasu1ya1 to Atri and Prasu1ti to Vasis2t2ha.
<>The great hermits such as Sanandana and the others
<>created before the Praja1patis, were not desirous of pro-
<>pagation as they were wise sages who had renounced
<>all attachments and who had been indifferent. When
<>Brahma1 saw that they were not mindful about produc-
<>ing subjects he grew angry. (It was from the middle of
<>the eye brows which were curved by his fury, that S4iva,
<>one of the three divine figures was born). After this,
<>Brahma1 appointed Sva1yambhuva, who originated from
<>himself, and was of the same shape, as the first Manu
<>for the protection of the subjects. This divine Manu
<>Sva1yambhuva took his sister S4ataru1pa1 as wife. Two
<>sons named Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da and two
<>daughters named Prasu1ti and A1ku1ti were born to them.
<>Of the two daughters Prasu1ti was given to Praja1pati
<>Daks2a and A1ku1ti to Praja1pati Ruci. A son named
<>Yajn5a and a daughter named Daks2in2a1 were born as
<>twins to Praja1pati Ruci. Twelve sons were born to
<>Yajn5a by Daks2in2a1. They were devas named the Yamas
<>of the Manvantara of Sva1yambhuva. Daks2a begot
<>twentyfour daughters of Prasu1ti. They were S4raddha1,
<>Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1, Buddhi,

<>come across an a1s4rama within his country. A sage

<>one part male and the other part female and the male
<>embraced the female, from which union was born the

<Poem>Dvidha1 kr2tva1tmano deha-
<>mardhena purus2osbhavat /
<>Ardhena na1ri1 tasya1m3 sa
<>Vira1jamasr2jat prabhuh2 //</Poem>
<NI>In the book of Genesis in the Bible, the origin of the
<>first woman is given. It is somewhat similar to the one
<>given above. God created Adam as the first man. God
<>caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam. Then he took
<>a rib from Adam, made a woman with it, and gave
<>that woman, who was called Eve, to Adam as wife.
<NI>2) {%Fascination.%} A story as given below occurs in Devi1
<>Pura1n2a, which states how woman acquired fascination.
<>Once Indra prohibited As4vini1devas from drinking the
<>liquor called Soma. They complained to the hermit
<>Cyavana, who agreed to recover for them the lost
<>right, for which purpose he began a sacrifice. Indra
<>caused obstruction to the sacrifice. Instantly by the
<>power of Cyavana, an asura named Mada rose up from
<>the sacrificial fire. Finally Indra begged the hermit for
<>pardon. Cyavana divided the asura into four parts
<>and placed one portion in gambling, one portion in
<>hunting, the third portion in liquor and the fourth
<>part in woman. Thenceforward woman began to have
<>fascination.
<NI>3) {%Manu, about women.%} The following is the place in
<>society of women in ancient days, according to Manu.
<>Husband or relatives should give women no freedom.
<>Even if they became immoral, they should be kept
<>under the control of men. As woman has to be under
<>the protection of father in childhood, under the pro-
<>tection of husband in youth and under the protection of
<>son in old age, she does not deserve freedom at any time.
<Poem>“Pita1 raks2ati kauma1re
<>Bharta1 raks2ati yauvane /

<>Na stri1 sva1tantryamarhati.”</Poem> [Page744-b+ 65]
<>The father who does not give his daughter to a suitable
<>husband before she attains puberty, the husband who

<>tioned Kun5jala a bird which lived nearby, why his
<>parents were eating dead bodies. The bird answered
<>that when the King and queen had recited the praises
<>of Va1sudeva they would see Vis2n2u. It also taught Vij-

<>he understood from their dress and bearing that they
<>were divine beings, S4ubhadatta was frightened. The
<>Yaks2as spoke to him and when they came to know that
<>he was poor, they engaged him as their servant. S4ubha-
<>datta served them with devotion. When it was time
<>for their meal they pointed to him a pot and asked him
<>to serve them food from it. But when S4ubhadatta saw
<>the pot empty, he was confused. The Yaks2as, with an
<>amused smile asked him to put his hand into the pot
<>and assured him that he would get anything he wished
<>to get from it.
<NI>S4ubhadatta accordingly took out all the things they
<>wanted from it and served them. They took their food
<>and were satisfied. A few days passed in this way and
<>then S4ubhadatta began to think of his family. The
<>Yaks2as understood that he was longing to return home.
<>So they allowed him to go after getting whatever boon
<>he wished to ask them. S4ubhadatta asked for that
<>magic pot which would supply whatever he wanted.
<>On hearing it the Yaks2as told him that he would not
<>be able to keep that pot and that if it was broken
<>everything would be lost. So they advised him to ask
<>them something else. But S4ubhadatta was not prepared
<>to accept their advice. At last they gave him the magic
<>pot.
<NI>S4ubhadatta reached home happily with the pot. He
<>told the whole story to his people at home. His neigh-
<>bours grew suspicious when he stopped going to the
<>forest to cut trees, after he returned with the pot. To
<>their enquiries about it, he replied haughtily and inform-
<>ed them of his good luck. One day in his frantic joy,
<>he danced, carrying the pot on his head and as ill-luck
<>would have it, he slipped his foot and fell down. The [Page746-a+ 65]
<>pot crashed to the ground and was broken to pieces.
<>So he was forced to become the wood-cutter again.

<>Sa1ran2a and she was her father's pet child. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 217, Verse 18).
<NI>2) {%Married to Arjuna.%} During his one year's pilgrimage
<>Arjuna, after visiting various holy places, came at last
<>to Prabha1sa ti1rtha in the plains of the western moun-
<>tain. He met Gada there who described to him the
<>unique beauty of Subhadra1. The description evoked
<>in him the desire to marry her for which purpose he
<>assumed the form of a Sannya1sin and sitting under a
<>tree thought about S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who understood the fact
<>while lying on the bed with Satyabha1ma1 and immedia-
<>tely he began laughing. Asked for the reason for his
<>laughing thus, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a told her about Arjuna think-
<>ing about him etc. Kr2s2n2a then went to Arjuna and
<>questioned him about the reason for his pilgrimage and
<>the latter explained the circumstances of it. They then
<>went to the Raivata mountain where Arjuna revealed
<>to Kr2s2n2a his desire to marry Subhadra1. Kr2s2n2a agreed
<>and, after leaving Arjuna at the mountain, returned to
<>Dva1raka1.
<NI>Within a few days the Ya1davas celebrated a festival at
<>Raivata attended by prominent leaders like Balabhadra,
<>Ugrasena, Pradyumna, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and others. The sight
<>of Subhadra1 among them evoked uncontrollable love in
<>Arjuna who asked Kr2s2n2a secretly about the means for him
<>to marry Subhadra1. Kr2s2n2a answered him thus: “Svayam3-
<>vara (marriage by self choice by a woman) is ordained
<>for Ks2atriyas. But, how would we know whom Subhadra1
<>loves. Abduction also is ordained for Ks2atriyas. So
<>you abduct Subhadra1.”
<NI>Arjuna immediately sent word about the matter through
<>emissaries to Indraprastha. After the festival at Raivata
<>was over, Subhadra1 returned to Dva1raka1. As for Arjuna,
<>he sat on a rock in the forest thinking about Subhadra1
<>when Ya1dava heroes like Bala, Sa1mba, Sa1ran2a, Pradyu-
<>mna and Gada came that way by chance. They saluted
<>the Sannya1sin (Arjuna) and after blessing them he made
<>them sit on the rock around him and related to them
<>various stories. Then Ya1davas felt great respect for the
<>Sannya1sin and invited him and took him to Dva1raka1.
<>Kr2s2n2a and others arranged for the stay of the Sannya1sin,
<>who pretended to spend Ca1turma1sya there. He was to
<>be fed from Subhadra1's house and the Sannya1sin was
<>overwhelmed with joy.
<NI>As days passed on thus, Arjuna grew more and more
<>sick with love. Subhadra1 felt unbounded affection for
<>him. She heard from him many stories about the valiant
<>Pa1n2d2ava, Arjuna. When he was convinced that Subhadra1
<>cherished strong love for him, Arjuna revealed the truth
<>about him. When he told her that he, the fake Sannya1sin,
<>was really Arjuna who was living there without the
<>knowledge of his mother and brothers, Subhadra1 bent
<>down her head in shyness.
<NI>Subhadra1's wedding was decided to be held on the
<>twelfth day from that date. Balabhadra and Uddhava
<>both of them short-tempered, were not informed about
<>the decision. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a took the lead in making prepar-
<>ations for the wedding and he saw Subhadra1 and gave
<>{??} all good wishes. [Page746-b+ 65]
<NI>Many of the Ya1dava chiefs wanted Subhadra1 to be
<>wedded to Duryodhana, a disciple of Balabhadra and
<>against this desire of theirs Subhadra1 and Arjuna to-
<>gether drove themselves away in a chariot through lines
<>of people and this created a stir among the Ya1davas.
<>But, Kr2s2n2a pacified them all. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>213-228; Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).

<>used by her in worship, appearing before her in the
<>guise of a monkey; on another occasion he threatened
<>her in the form of a lion and on a third occasion he
<>came disguised as a snake and bit on her legs. Very
<>much grieved over the story Vajra1n3ga again took to
<>penance with the grim determination to punish Indra
<>and when Brahma1 appeared before him he prayed for
<>the boon of a son who would surpass the Devas includ-
<>ing Indra in prowess. Brahma1 granted him the boon.
<>Vara1n3gi1 delivered a son twelve months after the boon.
<>The child was christened Ta1raka1sura.
<NI>Ta1raka1sura, as a child, began practising penance and
<>Brahma1 duly appeared before him and granted him
<>the boon that if he were to die, he would die at the
<>hands of a child only seven days old. Haughty over the
<>boon Ta1raka1sura very soon conquered the three worlds.
<>The devas found no means to suppress the asura. Child-
<>ren would not be born to them and there was a reason
<>for it. Once S4iva and Pa1rvati1 started the marital act
<>and it did not come to a close even after a hundred
<>divya-years, with the result that the world shook like
<>anything. Frightened at this the Devas requested
<>S4iva to stop the act and he obliged them. Then he
<>asked them who would bear the semen which had been
<>discharged and they replied, “Let earth itself bear the [Page747-b+ 65]
<>semen.” Accordingly it was discharged on the earth.
<>It filled and over-flowed forests and mountains.
<>What next was the problem. Ultimately the Devas
<>asked Agni (fire) to consume it. When Agni consumed
<>and burnt it down absolutely, the ashes thereof form-
<>ed into a white hill and it became a forest.
<NI>Pa1rvati1 did not at all relish the action of the devas and
<>spoke to them thus: “You prevented my sexual inter-
<>course entered into with the desire to have a son.
<>Therefore, in future you will not have children by your
<>wives.” Pa1rvati1 cursed the earth also as follows:
<>“You will become one of various forms and also a wife
<>to many people. You, who prevented me from having
<>a son, will not enjoy happiness from children.” (Va1lmi1-
<>ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 36).
<NI>Ta1raka1sura could be killed only by a child not more
<>than seven days old and the Devas realised that such
<>a child could be begot only by S4iva. It was the occas-
<>ion when S4iva was lamenting over the death of Sati1 and
<>Pa1rvati1 was doing penance to secure S4iva as husband.
<>None could stir S4iva immersed in deep meditation
<>and the Devas entrusted the responsibility for it to
<>Ka1madeva. Not only did Ka1ma not succeed in the
<>endeavour but also he got reduced to ashes by the fire
<>from S4iva's eyes. When Pa1rvati1's penance reached its
<>climax S4iva appeared before her and wedded her.
<NI>2). {%Birth of Subrahman2ya.%} Because of the power of
<>S4iva's semen consumed by Agni, his glow began getting
<>diminished. Agni complained of it to the Devas who
<>sent him over to Brahma1. On his way to Brahma1 Agni
<>met Gan3ga1devi1 whom he told thus: “I can in no way
<>bear this semen of S4iva and if I get rid of it, it will
<>burn the entire world. So, you please take charge of it
<>so that you will have a noble son. Gan3ga1's reply to
<>this was simply to ask Agni to throw the semen into
<>her waters and Agni did so. As the semen had remained
<>with Agni for nearly 5000 years, his flesh, blood
<>hair, eye etc. had become golden in colour and hence
<>Agni came to be called from that day onwards
<>Hiran2yaretas.
<NI>Time passed by and the semen of S4iva became a burden
<>to Gan3ga1. She complained about that to Brahma1.
<>Brahma1 asked her from whom she had received the
<>semen. Gan3ga1 detailed her story to him and concluded
<>by saying that though it was 5000 years since S4iva's
<>semen was put into her, she did not deliver yet. Then
<>Brahma1 told her as follows: “You go to the Udaya
<>mountain (where the sun rises). There is a forest there,
<>a forest hundred crores of yojanas in extent, where
<>S4ara, a particular variety of grass (Saccharam munja
<>Roxb) grows. You deposit the semen there and a male
<>child will be born after 10,000 years.
<NI>As directed by Brahma1 Gan3ga1 went to the Udaya
<>mountain and deposited the foetus there through her
<>mouth.
<NI>By the power of S4iva's semen all the trees and animals
<>and birds in the forest became golden in colour.
<>When 10,000 years were completed a child, as effulgent
<>as the rising sun, was born and Subrahman2ya was the
<>child. The child cried in a thunderous voice and six
<>divine Kr2ttika1s who came that way saw the child and
<>taking pity on it vied with one another to breast-feed
<>it. Since the child looked at the six Kr2ttika1s one after
<>the other it developed six faces and since it was breast-fed
<>by Kr2ttika1s it came to be named Ka1rttikeya as well. [Page748-a+ 65]
<>Brahma1 informed Agni about the birth of the child
<>and the latter, in great happiness, hastened to it on a
<>fast goat. Gan3ga1 who met Agni on the way and asked
<>him about his hurried trip was told about the birth of
<>the child and between the two developed an argument
<>about the ownership of the child. Maha1vis2n2u who came
<>that way just then listened to the above argument and
<>directed them to S4iva for settlement of their claims.
<NI>Agni and Gan3ga1 asked S4iva to which of them the child
<>really belonged S4iva then told Pa1rvati1 “Fortunate,
<>fortunate.” Only after seeing the child could it be
<>decided as to whose it was and so S4iva, Pa1rvati1, Agni
<>and Gan3ga1 proceeded together to the forest where they
<>saw the child in the lap of the Kr2ttika1s. S4iva then
<>said “Let us see whom the child looks at before settling
<>its parentage.” Understanding the ideas of the visitors
<>the child, by its yogic power, assumed four bodies
<>called Kuma1ra, Vis4a1kha, S4a1kha and Naigameya.
<>Kuma1ra looked at S4iva, Vis4a1kha at Pa1rvati1, S4a1kha at
<>Gan3ga1 and Naigameya at Agni and all of them felt
<>immensely happy. The Kr2ttika1s asked S4iva whether
<>S2an2mukha (child with six faces) was his son to which
<>S4iva answered as follows: “Let him be your son under
<>the name Ka1rttikeya; Gan3ga1's son under the name
<>Kuma1ra; Pa1rvati1's son under the name Skanda; my
<>son under the name Guha and Agni's son with the
<>name Maha1sena and under the name S4aravan2a ‘S4ara-
<>van2a's (the forest where it was born) son. He is a
<>great yogi1 and will be known by these various names.
<>As he possesses six faces he will become famous as
<>‘S2an2mukha’ also.
<NI>After having spoken thus S4iva thought of the Devas
<>and under the leadership of Brahma1 and Vis2n2u all the
<>Devas appeared there. They looked at the child to their
<>hearts’ content and then told S4iva thus: “Oh! Lord!
<>You made Agni serve the purpose of Devas. Let us
<>immediately start for Aujasa ti1rtha and crown S2an2-
<>mukha at Sarasvati1 in Kuruks2etra. Let him flourish
<>as army-chief of Devas, Gandharvas and Kinnaras and
<>let him kill the terrible Mahis2a1sura and Ta1raka1sura.
<NI>3) {%Coronation.%} Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and others reached
<>Kuruksetra with the child to crown him (Subrahman2ya)
<>as army-chief. S4iva and Vis2n2u performed the consecra-
<>tion ceremony with holy water from the seven seas.
<>Gandharvas, R2s2is and others sang for joy and Apsara1s
<>danced. Pa1rvati1 placed the child thus consecrated on
<>her lap and kissed him repeatedly on the head.
<NI>4) {%Presents.%} After Guha's consecration, the Devas
<>presented the army-chief valorous armies. He was
<>given by S4iva four Pramathas, equal in prowess to
<>Indra, called Ghan2t2a1karna, Lohita1ks2a, Nandis2en2a and
<>Kumudama1li1. Brahma1 and other Devas gave their
<>own Pramathas to him. Brahma1 gave him the Pra-
<>matha called Stha1n2u and Vis2n2u gave him three sets of
<>Pramathas called San3krama, Vikrama and Para1krama.
<>Indra gave him Utkles4a and Pan3kaja; Sun (Su1rya)
<>gave Dan2d2akapin5jalas; Moon gave Man2ivasuman2is;
<>the Asvins gave Vatsanandis etc. In short, important
<>Devas, Ma1tr2s, Ti1rthas etc. gave Subrahman2ya price-
<>less presents too numerous to be named.
<NI>Seeing the rush of presents the great Garud2a presented
<>his own son, the fast-going Peacock to Subrahmanya.
<>Arun2a gave his own son, the cock. Agni gave the Vel
<>(three-pronged weapon, trident), Br2haspati the dan2d2a
<>(club, stick) Gan3ga1, the Kaman2d2alu (water-pot of [Page748-b+ 65]
<>Sannya1sins) Vis2n2u the garland, Pa1rvati1 clothes, S4iva
<>the locket and Indra the string of pearls.
<NI>5) {%Deva1sura war.%} The consecration of Subrahman2ya
<>as Commander-in-Chief of the army kindled a new
<>hope and enthusiasm in the Devas. They challenged
<>the Asuras for war and they took it up. The asura
<>army entered the battle-field under the leadership of
<>unrivalled warriors like Ta1raka1sura, Mahis2a, Ba1n2a,
<>son of Maha1bali, Ta1raka's sons, Ta1raka1ks2a. Kamala1-
<>ks2a, Vidyunma1li1 etc. In the furious battle that ensued
<>Subrahman2ya killed Ta1raka1sura. The other asura
<>chiefs too were killed.
<NI>6) {%Vow of celibacy.%} After the killing of Ta1raka1sura
<>Subrahman2ya became the object of too much of petting
<>by Pa1rvati1 with the result that his life became un-
<>bridled and wayward. His lust was everyday on the
<>increase and he committed even rape on Deva women,
<>who were ultimately forced to complain about him to
<>Pa1rvati1. Immediately she called Subrahman2ya to her
<>and showed her own image in all other women and he
<>became so much repentant about his past actions that
<>he took the vow before Pa1rvati1 that in future he would
<>look upon all women in the world as equal to her, his
<>mother. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a 81).

<HI>SUDARS4ANA VI. One of the five sons of Bharata.
<>Bharata, the son of R2s2abha, had married Pan5cajani1,
<>the daughter of Vis4varu1pa. Five sons named Sumati,
<>Ra1s2t2rabhr2t, Sudars4ana, A1varan2a and Dhu1mraketu were
<>born to Bharata, who divided Bha1rata among his five
<>sons and went to Sa1lagra1ma and did penance there and
<>died. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<HI>SUDARS4ANA VII. The son born to god Fire by his wife
<>Sudars4ana1. (Sudars4ana1 was the daughter of Duryodhana
<>(Ni1la) of the dynasty of Iks2va1ku. For the story of her
<>marriage see under Sudars4ana1). Sudars4ana, the son of
<>Fire, married Oghavati1 the daughter of Oghava1n. That
<>story is given below:-
<NI>Oghava1n had two children a daughter named Oghavati1
<>and a son named Ogharatha. Oghava1n gave his daughter
<>in marriage to Sudars4ana who was wise and learned.
<>The couple lived in Kuruks2etra. Once Sudars4ana said
<>to Oghavati1 thus:- “You should honour guests in all
<>ways. If it is the desire of a guest, you should not draw
<>back from giving even your body. Whether I am present
<>here or not a guest should not be insulted.” Oghavati1
<>promised to obey the order of her husband to the letter.
<>Sudars4ana had been trying to become victorious over
<>Mr2tyu (Death) and so Death had been waiting to find
<>out some vulnerable point in Sudars4ana's life. While
<>Sudars4ana had gone to cut firewood, a brahmin entered
<>the hermitage and said to Oghavati1:- “If you do observe
<>the duties of a house-holder show hospitality to me.”
<>Hearing this, Oghavati1 welcomed the brahmin and per-
<>formed the usual hospitality and asked him “What
<>shall I do for you?” “Give yourself to me”, was the
<>answer. Seeing that the guest was not contented with
<>the usual hospitalities and remembering the words of her
<>husband, Oghavati1 gave herself to the guest. Both of
<>them entered the interior of the hermitage. At this
<>moment Sudar ana returned with firewood, and looked
<>for Oghavati1 and called her aloud, several times. He
<>got no reply. Then the Brahmin who was lying inside
<>called out:-“Hei! Son of Fire! A guest has come. Your
<>wife showed all kinds of hospitality. But I was not con-
<>tented with them. Now she is offering herself to me.”
<NI>These words did not seem to make any change in
<>Sudars4ana. Dharmadeva was much pleased, as Sudar-
<>s4ana had come out victorious in all these tests. He came
<>out and appeared in his own form and blessed Sudar-
<>s4ana. Due to the blessing of Dharmadeva, half of the
<>body of Oghavati1 flowed as the river Oghavati1 and the
<>other half was dissolved in the soul of her husband.
<>Sudars4ana thus earned victory over Mr2tyu and obtained
<>prosperity.
<HI>SUDARS4ANA VIII. A Vidya1dhara. Because of the curse
<>of An3giras, this Vidya1dhara was changed into a moun-
<>tain snake. That story occurs as follows in Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9.
<NI>While Sudars4ana was playing about in the world of
<>Gods with some Gandharva damsels, Angiras and some
<>other hermits came by that way. Sudars4ana ridiculed [Page751-b+ 65]
<>them. An3giras became angry and changed him to a
<>mountain snake by a curse. Sudars4ana prayed for libera-
<>tion from the curse. An3giras said that in Dva1parayuga,
<>Maha1vis2n2u would incarnate as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and when Kr2s2n2a
<>trod upon him, he would regain his original form.”
<NI>Sudars4ana became a big snake and began life in
<>Amba1d2i. Once the people of Amba1d2i went to Devi1
<>forest and worshipped Mahes4vara. They spent the night
<>on the banks of the river Ka1lindi1. In the night the snake
<>mentioned above, caught hold of the leg of Nandagopa.
<>Seeing the snake swallowing Nandagopa the rest of them
<>crowded there and struck at the snake with burning
<>faggots. But it was in vain. Finally S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came, and
<>gave the snake a thrash. Instantly Sudars4ana got his old
<>form. He went to the world of gods.
<HI>SUDARS4ANA IX. A brahmin sinner who lived in the
<>Treta1yuga. The moment he touched the water in which
<>Vis2n2u washed his feet, he obtained remission of his
<>sins and entered Vaikun2t2ha. This story which is given
<>under, occurs in Padma Pura1n2a, Brahma Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 17.
<NI>There lived a brahmin sinner in Treta1yuga. He used
<>to commit sins such as eating food on the eleventh lunar
<>day, ridiculing conventional fast and vow, etc. When he
<>died, the men of Yama took his soul to the world of
<>Yama. At his order Sudars4ana was laid in horrible
<>excrements for the period of hundred Manvantaras.
<>When he was released he was born on earth as a hog.
<>Because he ate food on Hariva1sara (a fast-day) he
<>suffered hell for a long time. His next birth was that
<>of a crow and lived on excrements. Once the crow
<>drank the water which fell on the steps while washing
<>the feet of Vis2n2u. The crow obtained remission of all
<>its sins. On the same day it was caught in the net of
<>a forestman and died. Then a divine chariot drawn by
<>swans came and took the crow to the world of Vis2n2u.
<HI>SUDARS4ANA X. The son of Di1rghaba1hu who was born
<>in the family of Manu. He conquered all the kingdoms
<>and ruled as an emperor. The famous hermit Vasis2t2ha
<>was his priest.
<NI>Once Devi1 Maha1ka1li1 appeared to him in a dream and
<>said to him: “Very soon a flood will occur in the world.
<>So go to the Hima1layas with your wife and the priest
<>Vasis2t2ha and stay there in a cave.” According to the
<>instruction of Devi1, Sudars4ana took everybody with him
<>and went to the Hima1layas.
<NI>The prophecy of Devi1 came true. The earth was filled
<>with water. This deluge lasted for ten years. After
<>that the earth resumed its original form and Sudars4ana
<>returned to Ayodhya1. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Pratisarga
<>Parva, 1, 1).
<NI>It is mentioned in Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a that Sudars4ana had
<>broken off a piece of a forest region of Hima1laya and
<>taken it to his country and founded on it the city called
<>Kha1n2d2avi1nagara and that after a short period king
<>Vijaya of the Bhairava dynasty killed king Sudars4ana
<>and became the ruler of the city. (Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a, 92).
<HI>SUDARS4ANA1 XI. A wife of God Fire. This Sudars4ana1
<>was the daughter of Duryodhana, the son of Durjaya
<>of the Iks2va1ku dynasty. The mother of Sudars4ana1
<>was Narmada1. It is said that so beautiful a woman as
<>Sudars4ana1 had never been born. The God Fire was
<>once fascinated by the beauty of Sudars4ana1 who had
<>been instructed to serve him, and wished to accept her
<>as his wife. So he informed her of his desire. Being [Page752-a+ 65]
<>of a noble race, she said that a virgin ought to be given
<>away by her parents. The God Fire approached the
<>father of Sudars4ana1 and informed him of every thing.
<>When he knew that the person who made the request
<>was the God Fire, the king gave his daughter Sudars4ana1
<>as wife to the God. (Duryodhana had another name
<>Ni1la). In the Pura1n2as there is another statement also
<>that Ni1la was the ruler of Ma1his2mati1. (See under
<>Duryodhana II and Agni Para 8).
<HI>SUDARS4ANA XII. An island. This is another name of
<>Jambu1dvi1pa. Once San5jaya talked to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>about this dvi1pa (Island). (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter
<>5).
<HI>SUDARS4ANA XIII. A tree in the Jambu1 island. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 7
<>that this tree was eleven thousand yojanas high.
<HI>SUDARS4ANA XIV. (The Discus Sudars4ana-weapon).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The weapon of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>Two stories are seen about the origin of this weapon.
<NI>(i) The sun married Sam3jn5a1 the daughter of Vis4va-
<>karma1. Sam3jn5a1 complained to her father that she could
<>not bear the radiance of the Sun. Vis4vakarma1 put the
<>Sun in a turning machine and turned him and decreas-
<>ed his radiance. Out of the dust of the sun produced
<>by this process, Vis4vakarma1 made the discus-weapon,
<>the aerial chariot Pus2paka, the Trident of S4iva, and
<>the S4akti (lance) of Subrahman2ya. Of these weapons
<>the discus-weapon Sudars4ana was given to Maha1vis2n2u.
<>This is one story. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3, Chapter 2).
<NI>(ii) During the burning of the forest Kha1n2d2ava, Indra
<>showered rain, against the fire. According to the second
<>story, the God Fire gave the discus weapon Sudars4ana
<>to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the Ga1n2d2i1va to Arjuna to fight
<>against Indra. (See the word Kha1n2d2avada1ha).
<NI>Besides these two stories, several statements occur in
<>various Pura1n2as, about this weapon Sudars4ana. As
<>Sudars4ana was in existence even before the incarnation
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, the story that Vis4vakarma1 made it, ought
<>to be given prominence. Very often Maha1vis2n2u used to
<>destroy enemies by this Sudars4ana. Though Maha1vis2n2u
<>had taken several incarnations, only S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is
<>mentioned in the Pura1n2as as having used this weapon
<>Sudars4ana very often.
<NI>2) {%The power of Sudars4ana.%} Sudars4ana flies up to the
<>ranks of the enemies, burning like fire. Once Maha1-
<>vis2n2u sent the weapon Sudars4ana towards the asuras.
<>Then the havoc and destruction caused by this weapon,
<>is described as follows:
<NI>The moment he thought of Sudars4ana, to destroy the
<>power of the enemy, it made its appearance like the
<>Sun in the Solar region. It was a fearful sight. Emanat-
<>ing light and radiance from the blazing fire, the
<>Sudars4ana rested on the hand of Vis2n2u; turning round
<>with a tremendous speed. Vis2n2u threw it at the
<>enemies with his powerful hand like that of the trunk
<>of an elephant, with a view to cleave the city of the
<>enemies into pieces. That weapon which was burning
<>in great flames like a great fire spreading radiance,
<>flew into the midst of the enemy's army and instantly
<>every one near it fell dead. Thus it flew about among
<>the asuras and burnt them to ashes. Then turning
<>round and round in the air it drank the blood shed
<>on the earth. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 19).
<HI>SUDARS4ANA XV. Indra had a chariot named
<>Sudars4ana. (Maha1bha1rata, Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56, [Page752-b+ 65]
<>Verse 3).

<>9th Skandha mentions that he was the son of Anenas
<>and Su1ci's father.
<HI>SUDES2N2A1 I. The wife of Vira1t2a, the King of Matsya.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} It is mentioned in Maha1bha1-

<>name Citra1 also.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) During the pseudonymity, Pa1n5ca1li1 lived with
<>Sudes2n2a1 in the guise of Sairandhri1. (M.B. Vira1t2a

<>by the King of Vidarbha to search for Damayanti1.
<>(See under Damayanti1).
<HI>SUDEVA II. A captain of the army of King Ambari1s2a.
<>He was calm and fearless. Sudeva met with a heroic
<>death in a battle and attained heaven. Indra gave him
<>a suitable place. Later Ambari1s2a died and came to
<>heaven. There he saw his captain Sudeva and was
<>amazed. He asked Indra how it was that Sudeva was
<>given a place in heaven. Indra replied that to fight
<>fearlessly in the battle-field and meet with heroic death,
<>was a yajn5a (sacrifice) and that due to this yajn5a
<>Sudeva attained heaven. The King asked, when this [Page753-a+ 65]
<>took place. Indra continued:--“Once Ambari1s2a sent
<>Sudeva to subdue the asuras and giants. Sudeva enter-
<>ed the battlefield and looked at the vast army of the
<>enemy. Finding that it was impossible to defeat the
<>army of giants, he sat down and meditated on S4iva,
<>who appeared before him and encouraged him. A fierce
<>battle followed in which Sudeva annihilated the army
<>of the giants completely and he himself met with a
<>heroic death. That is how he obtained heaven. (M.B.
<>Da1ks2in2a1tyapa1t2ha, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 98).
<HI>SUDEVA III. The son of Haryas4va, the King of Ka1s4i1.
<>He was quite valiant and radiant. After the death of
<>his father he was anointed as King of Ka1s4i1. As soon as
<>he became King, the sons of King Vi1tahavya attacked
<>Sudeva and captured him. After this Divoda1sa became
<>the King of Ka1s4i1. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>30, Verse 13).
<HI>SUDEVA IV. A famous King. Na1bha1ga married
<>Suprabha1 the daughter of this King Sudeva. The
<>following is a story taken from Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a
<>stating how this Sudeva who was a Ks2atriya by birth,
<>became a Vais4ya by the curse of hermit Pramati.
<NI>Once Nala, the friend of Sudeva, and the relative of
<>Dhu1mra1ks2a, after having drunk too much liquor, tried
<>to rape the wife of the hermit Pramati. All this happen-
<>ed while King Sudeva was standing silently near Nala.
<>Pramati requested King Sudeva repeatedly to save his
<>wife. Sudeva replied: ‘The Ks2atriya who could help
<>the needy, could save your wife also. But I am a
<>Vais4ya.” This arrogance of the King made the
<>hermit angry. “May you become a Vais4ya.”
<>The hermit cursed the King. Sudeva repented
<>and requested for liberation from the curse. “When a
<>Ks2atriya steals away your daughter you will recover
<>the lost feelings of Ks2atriya.” The hermit gave this
<>liberation from the curse.
<NI>Because of this curse Na1bha1ga stole away Suprabha1
<>the daughter of Sudeva and Sudeva got back the lost
<>feelings of Ks2atriya.
<HI>SUDEVA1 I. A daughter of the King of An3ga named
<>Ariha. The King R2ks2a was her son. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 95, Verse 24).
<HI>SUDEVA1 II. A princess born in the dynasty of King
<>Das4a1rha. Vikun2t2ha, a King of the Pu1ru dynasty
<>married Sudeva1. The King Ajami1d2ha was their son.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 36).
<HI>SUDEVA1 III. The wife of Iks2va1ku who was the son of
<>Manu. This Sudeva1 was the daughter of Devara1ta the
<>King of Ka1s4i1. Iks2va1ku and Sudeva1 are said to be the
<>incarnations of Vis2n2u and Devi1 Laks2mi1 respectively.
<>While the couple were walking about in the forest, they
<>saw a she-hog. That hog was the cursed form of a
<>Brahmin woman named Sudeva1. Sudeva1, the wife of
<>Iks2va1ku gave the merits she had earned in one year by
<>her good deeds to Sudeva1 the she-hog and liberated her
<>from her curse. This story occurs in Padma Pura1n2a
<>Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapter 42. The story is given below:
<NI>Once King Iks2va1ku and his wife Sudeva1 were hunting
<>on the banks of the Gan3ga1. Then a big hog came there
<>with his wife and children. The hog was afraid of
<>Iks2va1ku. So he said to his wife:--“Look! beloved!
<>Iks2va1ku the valiant, the son of Manu, is come for hunt-
<>ing. I am going to fight with him.” His wife said. “How
<>did you get this bravery to fight with the king, you who
<>always try to evade the forest-men?” “It is not [Page753-b+ 64]
<>bravery, my love. It is because I could go to heaven if
<>I fight with the king valiantly and meet with heroic
<>death”, replied the hog. The wife tried her utmost to
<>dissuade her husband from his attempt. The children
<>also tried to stop him. They could not change his mind.
<>So all of them decided to help him as much as they
<>could in his fight. They got ready for a fight against
<>Iks2va1ku and his army.
<NI>The king's army saw the preparations of the hogs and
<>their resolute stand. Struck with fear, they informed
<>Iks2va1ku about it. The king ordered the noble hog to be
<>caught. Iks2va1ku and his wife mounted on horse and
<>followed the army. All the hounds ran towards the
<>hogs barking. The army sent a volley of arrows at the
<>hogs. The hog and his wife stopped the arrows. The
<>army could not defeat the hogs. At last the king him-
<>self killed the hog with a club. While the king was
<>looking on, that noble hog was changed to a noble
<>Gandharva with four hands and divine clothes and
<>ornaments. Leaving his old body of hog on the earth
<>he rose up into the sky like the Sun and went to heaven.
<>Seeing this sight Sudeva1 was struck with fear. She got
<>down from the chariot and called the wife of the hog
<>towards her. The wife of the hog, wounded all over,
<>came to the queen Sudeva1. Sudeva1 asked her about
<>the previous history of her dead husband. The hog's
<>wife said: “Lady! If you feel interested I shall tell you
<>about the previous life of my dead husband and my-
<>self.”
<NI>“My dead husband was a Gandharva named Ran3kavidya1-
<>dhara, in the previous birth. Once he sat in the shade of
<>a tree near the hermitage of Pulastya and began to sing
<>with accompaniment. As the singing caused disturbance
<>to his solitude the hermit Pulastya came and requested
<>the Gandharva to shift to some other place. Ran3kavid-
<>ya1dhara did not like to comply with the request
<>of the hermit. At last Pulastya removed his hermitage
<>to another place. Ran3kavidya1dhara walked in search
<>of Pulastya. Finally the Gandharva saw Pulastya.
<>Seeing that he was alone, the Gandharva took the shape
<>of a hog and entered the hermitage and began to wound
<>with his tusk and to molest that radiant sage Pula-
<>stya. Thinking it to be a mere animal Pulastya suffered
<>it for a long time. The hog continued its actions of
<>molestation. It passed excrements in front of the sage,
<>danced before him, played in front of him, fell down in
<>the courtyard and rolled and did various other things.
<>As it was an animal Pulastya forgave him. One day
<>Ran3kavidya1dhara entered the hermitage as a hog, roared
<>aloud, laughed aloud, cried aloud, sang aloud and in
<>various other ways tried to change the mind of the her-
<>mit. Seeing all these, Pulastya began to think that it
<>was not a hog. “A hog will not try to molest one con-
<>tinuously. I forgave him thinking him to be a mere
<>animal. This must be that wicked Gandharva.” Thus
<>recognizing him Pulastya got angry and cursed him
<>thus: “You tried to violate my penance in the shape of
<>a hog. So you, great sinner; take the next birth as a
<>hog.” With grief the Gandharva ran to Indra and in-
<>formed him of everything. Indra requested Pulastya
<>to liberate the Gandharva from the curse. Accordingly
<>Pulastya gave him remission that he would regain his
<>original form when he was killed by the hands of the
<>immensely good king Iks2va1ku.” [Page754-a+ 65]
<NI>Sudeva1 was amazed on hearing this story of the dead
<>hog, and asked her again. “You hog! You speak like a
<>human being. How is it?”
<NI>The wife of the hog continued the story. “Lady! I also
<>have taken rebirth as a hog. In my previous birth I was
<>the daughter of a Brahmin named Vasudatta (Va1sudeva)
<>in the city of S4ri1pura in Kalin3ga. They named me
<>Sudeva1 (Vasudeva1). Because of the unlimited caressing
<>and fondling of my father I grew up as an arrogant
<>girl. In the meanwhile a Brahmin youth named S4iva-
<>s4arma1, who was well-versed in all the branches of know-
<>ledge, and whose parents were dead, came to my house.
<>My father gave me to that brahmin. I lived with him
<>in my father's house. Being proud of the wealth and
<>prosperity of my parents I did not care to render the
<>services due to my husband. My husband who was a
<>peaceful man bore everything. By and by I became wicked.
<>At last because of my wickedness and immorality my
<>husband left the country. My father hated me and
<>expelled me from the house. My father feared that
<>some calamity would happen to me as Kam3sa was born
<>to Padma1vati1, the wife of Ugrasena, by her illegal con-
<>nection with persons other than her husband.”
<NI>Hearing about the birth of Kam3sa, Sudeva1 asked the
<>she-hog to tell her about the circumstances which led to
<>the illegal connections of Padma1vati1. The wife of the
<>hog continued. “In days of old there was a king in
<>Mathura1puri1 named Ugrasena, who married Padma1vati1
<>the daughter of king Satyaketu of Vidarbha. While the
<>couple were living happily in Mathura1puri1 Satyaketu
<>wanted to see his daughter. He sent a messenger to
<>Mathura1puri1 and brought Padma1vati1 to Vidarbha. She
<>walked along the vicinity of the palace in which she was
<>born, enjoying the beauty of the scenery. She walked on
<>and arrived on the mountain called Pus2pava1n, and sat
<>on the bank of a lake. At that time a Gandharva named
<>Godila (Dramila) came there. He fell in love with her.
<>He took the shape of Ugrasena and came near her and
<>talked with her. Thinking that her husband had come
<>from Mathura1 to see her she embraced him. After a
<>while she understood that the visitor was not her
<>husband. She began to curse him. The visitor admitted
<>that he was Godila an attendant of Vais4ravan2a. Godila
<>went on his way. But she had become pregnant by that
<>time. Her parents tried in various ways to destroy the
<>child in her womb. One day the infant lying in her
<>womb told her thus: “Mother! you do not know who
<>I am. I am the rebirth of a powerful asura named
<>Ka1lanemi. In ancient days Vis2n2u killed me in a battle
<>between the gods and asuras. I have entered into your
<>womb for revenge. Mother! you need not take the
<>trouble to destroy me.” Saying so, the infant stopped
<>speaking. After ten years Padma1vati1 gave birth to the
<>mighty and strong Kam3sa. He was killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>and he attained heaven.”
<NI>Sudeva1 was struck with wonder at the story of Kam3sa.
<>She asked the she-hog to continue her own story. She
<>continued her own story. “I have said that my father
<>expelled me. Being shameless I walked away from there
<>soon. Nobody helped me. Those who saw me scolded
<>me. Days passed. Afflicted by a horrible disease, and
<>travelling in this manner, I came to a big house. I
<>entered the courtyard and begged for alms. It was the
<>house of my husband S4ivas4arma1. When I abandoned
<>him he married another woman named Man3gala1 and [Page754-b+ 64]
<>was leading a prosperous life. Man3gala1 gave me food.
<>S4ivas4arma1 asked me who I was. I told him my story.
<>He remembered me, his former wife. Man3gala1 also felt
<>compassion for me. They gave me gold ornaments and
<>made me stay there. But my conscience pricked me.
<>Thus burning internally I died.
<NI>My soul went to hell. After the suffering of a very long
<>period, I took birth again as a Jackal. Then I became
<>a dog, and then a snake. After that I passed through
<>the births of a hen, a cat and a rat. Thus Brahma1 had
<>put me in the wombs of all kinds of animals. Now I have
<>taken the birth of a she-hog. Lady! Your husband
<>Iks2va1ku is the incarnation of Vis2n2u in portion and your-
<>self, that of Laks2mi1 in portion. If you would give me
<>the merits you have earned for one day by your good
<>deeds, I could leave off all these mean births and attain
<>heaven.”
<NI>The eyes of Sudeva1 were full when she heard the story
<>of the hog. She gave to the she-hog, the merits she had
<>earned by good deeds for one year. The hog was changed
<>to a divine woman of youth and beauty. Immediately
<>a divine chariot came down from heaven and took her
<>to heaven, while everybody was looking on. Iks2va1ku
<>and Sudeva1 returned to their palace much pleased at
<>the redemption of the she-hog.

<>turned to his father's a1s4rama.
<NI>3) {%In Vya1sa's hut.%} Vya1sa was very happy at the arrival
<>of his son after completing his education. In due course
<>he thought of getting his son married to a suitable girl
<>and to prepare him for an ideal Grhastha1s4rama. But
<>S4uka did not fall in with his father's proposal. All the
<>efforts of Vya1sa to persuade him were in vain. At last
<>he told S4uka that he was pleased with his stern resolve
<>and allowed him to pursue his life as a Sannya1si1, if he
<>wished for it.
<NI>From that time S4ukadeva and Su1ta, the disciple of
<>Vya1sa began the study of Bha1gavata. But S4uka did [Page757-b+ 64]
<>not find happiness in that study either. Vya1sa taught
<>him spiritual philosophy. Even then S4uka could not
<>find mental satisfaction. So his father sent him to
<>Mithila1. At that time there was none who equalled
<>Janaka, the then King of Mithila1. Before sending him
<>away, Vya1sa made his son promise that he would
<>return to his a1s4rama, immediately after leaving
<>Mithila1.
<NI>4) {%S4uka in Mithila1.%} S4uka started his journey to
<>Mithila1 on foot. He passed through many lands and
<>cities on his way. He visited many places inhabited by
<>different classes of people like yogins, sages, mendicants,
<>Vaikha1nasas, S4a1ktas, Pa1s4upatas, Sauras, S4aivas,
<>Vais2n2avas, etc. After taking two years to cross Maha1-
<>meru and one year for crossing Hima1laya he reached
<>Mithila1. At the very sight of the land of Mithila1 with
<>its inhabitants living in luxury and prosperity, S4uka-
<>deva was filled with wonder.
<NI>One of the sentries at the palace gate who saw the
<>dignified bearing and majestic figure of S4uka, standing
<>at the entrance, greeted him with joined palms and
<>conducted him into the royal palace. From there, a
<>minister took him to the interior of the palace, where
<>a passage led him to a beautiful park full of flowering
<>trees and swimming pools. After giving him a seat in
<>the park the minister left the place. There, he was
<>attended by women who were like celestial beauties.
<>But S4uka was not happy even in their company or
<>attentions. He spent the whole night in deep meditation.
<>The next morning King Janaka visited S4uka. After the
<>exchange of customary greetings, Janaka enquired of
<>him the object of his visit. S4uka answered that he came
<>there to learn from Janaka the way to salvation, as
<>directed by his father.
<NI>On hearing this, Janaka said:--“After Upanayana,
<>(investiture with the sacred thread) a Bra1hman2a
<>should study the Vedas. He should discharge his debts
<>to the Devas and to his Pitr2s by tapas, worship of the
<>guru and Brahmacarya. After the study of the Vedas,
<>after mastering the senses, he should give Gurudaks2in2a1
<>(fee to the teacher). Then the pupil may return home
<>with the permission of the Guru (preceptor). After
<>reaching home he should begin gr2hastha1s4rama. After
<>the birth of children, he should follow Va1naprasth-
<>a1s4rama. In that a1s4rama, a Bra1hman2a should kindle
<>fire in his soul. He should then renounce the dual state,
<>rise above all desire and remain in Brahma1s4rama.”
<NI>After receiving Janaka's advice, S4uka returned to his
<>father.
<NI>5) {%Domestic Life.%} S4ukadeva married the beautiful
<>Pi1vari1, daughter of the Pitr2s and thus began his
<>gr2hastha1s4rama in Vya1sa's a1s4rama. He had four sons
<>named Kr2s2n2a, Gauraprabha, Bhu1ri and Devas4ruta and
<>a daughter named Ki1rti, by Pi1vari1. Ki1rti was married
<>by An2u, the son of King Vibhra1ja. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>1st Skandha).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Vya1sa composed Bha1rata and taught it to S4uka.
<>(M.B. Chapter 1, Verse 104).
<NI>(ii) S4ukadeva recited the Maha1bha1rata story contain-
<>ing 14 lakhs of stanzas to Gandharvas, Yaks2as and
<>Ra1ks2asas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 106;
<>Svarga1rohan2a Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 55).
<NI>(iii) S4ukadeva taught them the entire Vedas and the [Page758-a+ 64]
<>Maha1bha1rata story. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 63,
<>Verse 89).
<NI>(iv) S4uka attended Yudhis2t2hira's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11).
<NI>7) {%The End.%} While S4ukadeva was thus leading his family
<>life, teaching the Vedas and reading the Pura1n2as,
<>Na1rada happened to pay a visit to him. His conversa-
<>tion with Na1rada drew S4ukadeva nearer to the path of
<>Moks2a. He left his father, Veda Vya1sa and his own
<>family, went to the peak of Kaila1sa and stayed there
<>doing tapas to Paramas4iva. At last he became a per-
<>fect Siddha and rising up to the Heavens shone there
<>as a second sun. Devars2is began to praise S4ukadeva.
<NI>His father Vya1sa was in deep grief at his disappearance
<>and left his a1s4rama in search of S4uka. After wandering
<>in many places he came to Kaila1sa where S4uka had per-
<>formed tapas and called him. S4iva who saw him utterly
<>tired and weak took pity on him and comforted him in
<>the following words: “Did you not pray to me for a
<>son who would combine in himself the essences of the
<>Pan5cabhu1tas? As a result of the tapas you have done
<>and by my blessing, such a glorious son was born to
<>you. S4uka has attained the highest position which is
<>inaccessible to those who have not conquered their
<>senses and difficult to attain even by the gods. Why do
<>you worry about S4uka? The glory acquired by your
<>eminent son will continue undiminished as long as the
<>mountains and oceans exist. I give you my blessing
<>that an image exactly like your son will always accom-
<>pany you from today.” Just then, an image which
<>closely resembled his son appeared before Vya1sa who
<>was filled with rapture.
<NI>It is believed that even today if any one calls S4iva at
<>the place where S4iva spoke to Vya1sa in answer to his
<>call, S4iva would respond to the call. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapters 332 and 333; Devi1 Bha1gavata, 1st
<>Skandha).
<HI>S4UKA II. A messenger of Ra1van2a. This S4uka had a
<>friend named Sa1ran2a. These two persons were expert
<>spies who used to gather secret and important pieces of
<>information from the strongholds of Ra1van2a's friends
<>and enemies and passed them on to Ra1van2a.
<NI>Soon after S4ri1 Ra1ma entered Lan3ka1, Ra1van2a sent S4uka
<>and Sa1ran2a to S4ri1 Ra1ma's camp. After taking a distant
<>view of the surroundings, they entered the camp of
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma in the form of monkeys. Taking care not to
<>come within the observation of Vibhi1s2an2a, they went
<>about the military camps, gathering secret information.
<>Just then they were met by Ja1mbava1n and Hanu1ma1n.
<>After closely observing them for a considerable time,
<>they understood that they were enemy spies. The
<>monkey-heroes promptly seized them and produced
<>them before Sugri1va. Confused and frightened under a
<>shower of questions they sought the protection of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. While S4ri1 Ra1ma was interrogating them,
<>Vibhi1s2an2a happened to come there. At his sight, S4uka
<>and Sa1ran2a were alarmed. Grasping the whole situation
<>in an instant, Vibhi1s2an2a kicked both of them when
<>they assumed their former shapes as Ra1ks2asas. The
<>monkey-leaders sprang at them. The Ra1ks2asas begged
<>for pardon and prayed for S4ri1 Ra1ma's protection. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma forgave them and set them free. (Va1lmi1ki

<HI>SUKES4A (SUKES4I1).
<NI>1) {%General information%} A ra1ks2asa (giant) who was the
<>son of Vidyutkes4a and Sa1lakat2an3ka1. When Brahma1
<>asked the Subjects to look after his creation those who
<>said ‘Raks2a1mahe’ became Ra1ks2asas (giants) and those
<>who said ‘Yaks2a1mahe’, the Yaks2as (a clan of semi gods).
<>Once two brothers named Heti and Praheti were born [Page759-a+ 65]
<>in the clan of Ra1ks2asas. Praheti remained unmarried and
<>entered the life of penance. Heti married Bhaya1 the sister
<>of Ka1la. A son named Vidyutkes4a was born to the cou-
<>ple. Vidyutkes4a married Sa1lakat2an3ka1, the daughter of
<>Sandhya1. Sa1lakat2an3ka1 delivered a son. But wishing
<>to enjoy the company of her husband, she abandoned
<>the son and lived with her husband. The child which
<>was as bright as the rising Sun, putting its folded fist
<>in its mouth, cried aloud. Paramas4iva and Pa1rvati1
<>who were travelling along the sky mounted on the bull,
<>heard the cry of the infant and looked at the spot from
<>which the cry arose. On seeing the infant, Pa1rvati1 took
<>pity on it. S4iva blessed the child, which instantly grew
<>as old as its mother. S4iva gave the Ra1ks2asa prince
<>immortality and a city which could travel through the
<>sky. Pa1rvati1 said that Ra1ks2asa women would, in future
<>deliver the moment they became pregnant and that the
<>child would grow equal to its mother in age, as soon as
<>it was born. Sukes4a was the son of Vidyutkes4a and
<>Sa1lakat2an3ka1. Sukes4a was delighted at the boons he
<>got, and travelled wherever he pleased, in his city.
<NI>Sukes4a married Devavati1 the daughter of Gra1man2i1 a
<>Gandharva. Ma1li1, Suma1li1 and Ma1lyava1n were the
<>sons of this couple. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%The city of Sukes4a fell on the ground.%} Sukes4a pleased
<>S4iva by penance. S4iva made him invincible and gave
<>him a city which travelled through the sky. Because of
<>these boons, the Ra1ks2asa became righteous and pious.
<>He lived in the city with other Ra1ks2asas. Once Sukes4a
<>went to the forest Ma1gadha and visited the hermits
<>there. He asked them about the means to attain pros-
<>perity in this world and the other worlds. The hermits
<>gave him long exhortations. They told him about the
<>various hells given to sinners. Thus Sukes4a became
<>righteous-minded and saintly. He returned to his
<>city and called together all the other Ra1ks2asas and
<>spoke to them about what he had learned from the
<>hermits. He said: “The hermits taught me the means
<>to attain heaven. They are Non-killing, Truth, not
<>stealing, cleanliness, control of all outward going ener-
<>gies, liberality, kindness, forgiveness, abstinence, good
<>usages etc. So it is my order that all of you observe
<>these good things.” The Ra1ks2asas were pleased at the
<>words of Sukes4a. They began to lead a righteous life.
<>In this way they got wealth and prosperity. Their
<>radiance increased to such an extent that the Sun and
<>the moon and the stars found it difficult to continue
<>their travels.
<NI>Thus the city of the Ra1ks2asa shone as the sun in the day
<>and as the moon in the night. The progress of the Sun
<>in the day became indiscernible. Due to its brightness
<>the Ra1ks2asa city seemed to be the moon and thinking
<>that it was night, the lotus flowers folded in the day
<>and bloomed in the night. Havoc was caused in the
<>earth as well as in the world of the gods. The sun be-
<>came unpopular. So he tried to find out the cause. At
<>last he found out the cause. He became angry. He
<>looked with fury at the city of the Ra1ks2asas. Hit by
<>the look, the city lost its merits and began to sink down
<>to the earth.
<NI>When the city fell down Sukes4a called S4iva and cried
<>aloud. S4iva looked round to see what happened to his
<>devotee. He understood that the sun was the culprit.
<>S4iva looked at the sun with furious eyes. Instantly the
<>sun was dropped from the Solar region to the air. The [Page759-b+ 64]
<>hermits saw the Sun coming slowly to the earth. They
<>called out loudly. “If you want to be well in falling,
<>go and fall in Hariks2etra.” The sun called out, “What
<>is Hariks2etra?” “Hariks2etra is Va1ra1n2asi1 from Yogas4a1yi1
<>to Kes4avadars4ana”, the hermits replied. Hearing this
<>the Sun fell in Va1ra1n2asi1. Then to lessen the heat the
<>sun dipped and splashed in Asi ti1rtha and Varun2a1
<>ti1rtha.
<NI>Brahma1 knew this, and informed S4iva of it. S4iva came to
<>Va1ra1n2asi1 and took the sun by his hands and gave him the
<>name ‘Lola’ and sent him back in the chariot. After
<>that Brahma1 went to Sukes4a and sent his city with the
<>Ra1ks2asas in it, back to the sky, and the Sun was fixed
<>in the sky as before. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 15)
<HI>SUKES4I1 I (SUKES4A). See under Sukes4a.
<HI>SUKES4I1 II. The daughter of the king of Ga1ndha1ra.
<>This Sukes4i1 was the wife of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38 that S4ri1-
<>Kr2s2n2a gave her a palace, the doors of which shone

<HI>SUKETU I. A king of the Solar dynasty. It is stated in
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 9 that this king was the son of
<>Nandivardhana and the father of Devara1ta.
<HI>SUKETU II. A. king of the Pu1ru dynasty. He became
<>famous under the name Viratha. He was one of the
<>five sons of Bharata. The five sons were Suhotra,
<>Suhota1, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 278).
<HI>SUKETU III. A king of ancient India. It is mentioned
<>in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 9, that

<HI>SUKETU IV. A son of S4is4upa1la He was killed in the
<>battle of Bha1rata by Dron2a. (M.B. Karn2a Parva,

<>Bha1rata-battle. This king who was the son of Citraketu,
<>was killed by the arrow of the teacher Kr2pa. (M.B.
<>Karn2a Parva, Chapter 54, Verse 21).
<HI>SUKETU VI. The father of Ta1t2aka1. It is stated in
<>Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, that this Suketu was the
<>son of the Gandharva King Suraks2aka. (See under
<>Ta1t2aka1 for further details).
<HI>S4UKI1. A daughter of Kas4yapa Praja1pati. Five daughters
<>named Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1
<>were born to Kas4yapa by his wife Ta1mra1. Kraun5ci1

<>Maha1bha1rata, Karn2a Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 45, men-
<>tions that he was slain by Karn2a during the Bha1rata
<>battle.
<HI>S4UKRA (S4UKRA1CA1RYA) I. Preceptor of the Asuras.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Views differ as to whether S4ukra was the
<>son or grandson of Bhr2gu. The Pura1n2as state that
<>Puloma1 was the wife of Bhr2gu. S4ukra has another name,
<>Ka1vya. Ka1vya means the son of Kavi. Some autho-
<>rities say that Kavi was Bhr2gu's son, while others think
<>that Kavi was Bhr2gu himself. S4ukra's mother is re-
<>ferred to as “Ka1vyama1ta1” in many places. S4ukra is re-
<>ferred to as the strongest of the seven sons born to
<>Bhr2gu and Puloma1. In the light of these references it
<>is reasonable to consider S4ukra as the son of the sage
<>Bhr2gu. “Kavi” must be supposed to be another name
<>of Bhr2gu. Us4anas was another name for S4ukra.
<NI>2) {%Love story.%} Once the sage Bhr2gu lived in the valley
<>of Mandara mountain, performing austere tapas. S4ukra
<>who was then a boy, used to attend on his father. One
<>day when Bhr2gu was absorbed in “Nirvikalpasama1dhi”
<>(deep meditation) the lonely S4ukra was appreciating
<>the beauty of the sky above him. There was no one
<>else by his side. At that time he happened to see an
<>exceptionally beautiful Apsara1 woman passing across the
<>sky. His heart was filled with delight at the sight. All
<>his thoughts were centred on her and he sat absorbed
<>in her bewitching charm. In his imagination he follow-
<>ed Indra and reached Indraloka. Indra greeted him
<>with honour. After that S4ukra, attended by the hea-
<>venly beings went about sight-seeing in Heaven. There
<>he unexpectedly came across the Apsara1 beauty whom
<>he had seen earlier, in the midst of several other
<>women. They fell in love at first sight. To fulfil his
<>desire S4ukra enveloped the whole place in darkness.
<>The other women left the place. The apsara1 beauty
<>approached S4ukra and both of them entered a hut form-
<>ed by the thick foliage of creeping plants and indulged
<>in sensual pleasures. Since S4ukra spent a period of
<>eight Caturyugas like this in her company, he became
<>weak in his virtue and descended to the earth. Then
<>he became conscious of his physical being. His depraved
<>soul was stopped at the moon. It reached the earth
<>through mist and grew up as paddy plants. A Bra1hman2a
<>who was a native of Das4a1rn2a land ate the rice which
<>was cooked from the ears of those paddy plants. S4ukra's
<>soul in the shape of S4ukra entered the womb of the
<>Bra1hmana's wife and in due course took his birth.
<>Because of his close association with Munis, that boy
<>grew up like a sage and spent a period of one Manvan-
<>tara, leading an austere life in the valley of the Meru
<>mountain. At that time his Apsara1 woman had been
<>born as a female deer, as the result of a curse. By
<>their connection in the previous birth, the Bra1hman2a
<>fell in love with that female deer and begot a human
<>child by his union with her. With that the austerities
<>of his life were at an end. All his thoughts were now
<>directed towards the future glory of his son and he
<>ignored even his spiritual duties. Not long after, he died
<>of snake bite. Later, he was born as the son of the king
<>of Madra and ruled the country for many years. After
<>that he took birth in many other wombs and at last was
<>born as the son of a Mahars2i living on the bank of the
<>river Gan3ga1. S4ukra's body which was by the side of
<>Bhr2gu dropped to the earth after being exposed to the
<>wind and sun for a long time. But owing to Bhr2gu's [Page760-b+ 65]
<>power of tapas and the holiness of the a1s4rama, birds and
<>animals did not eat the body. After 1,000 divyavatsaras,
<>sage Bhr2gu opened his eyes from his sama1dhi but he did
<>not find his son near him. A famished and worn out body
<>was lying before him. Within the wrinkles of the skin,
<>small birds were nesting and frogs took refuge in the
<>hollow of the stomach. Enraged at the premature death
<>of his son, he was about to curse Yama, the god of Death.
<>Coming to know of this Dharmara1ja (Yama) appeared
<>before him and said:--“We honour and adore you as
<>a great tapasvi1. You should not ruin your tapas. I have
<>devoured numerous Brahma1n2d2as. I have already swal-
<>lowed Rudras and Vis2n2udevas many times. All of you
<>are my food. It is ordained by Fate. Even Brahma1 is not
<>indestructible at the end of a Kalpa. Knowing all these
<>facts, why do you think of cursing me? Your son fell
<>into this state because of his own act. While you were in
<>a state of Sama1dhi your son's mind left its body
<>and went up to Heaven. There he spent many years in-
<>dulging in sensual pleasures in the company of the
<>celestial beauty Vis4va1ci1. Then he was born as a Bra1h-
<>man2a in Das4a1rn2a country. In his next birth he became
<>the King of Kosala. After that passing through many
<>births in succession he is now performing tapas on the
<>bank of the river Saman3ga1 as the son of a Bra1hman2a,
<>under the name, Va1sudeva. Open your inner eye and
<>see for yourself.”
<NI>After saying this Dharmara1ja revived the body of S4ukra
<>who rose up and did obeisance to his father. (Jn5a1na-
<>va1sis2t2ha, Sthitiprakaran2am).
<NI>(3) {%Domestic Life.%} It is seen that S4ukra had several
<>wives and children. In Devi1 Bha1gavata there is a story
<>of Jayanti1, daughter of Indra who was S4ukra's wife for
<>about ten years. (See under Jayanti1 II). Priyavrata, the
<>brother of Utta1napa1da had a daughter named U1rjjasvati1
<>by his wife Suru1pa1. In Devi1 Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha
<>it is stated that S4ukra1ca1rya married U1rjjasvati1 and he
<>had a daughter Devaya1ni1 by her. Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 65 mentions that S4ukra was the a1ca1rya

<NI>Once Indra wanted to test Sukr2s2a. So he came in the

<>Dron2aputra, Pin3ga1ks2a, Vibodha, Suputra and Sumukha.
<>As a remission of the curse, the hermit said that even

<HI>SUKUMA1RA IV. A Sanskrit poet. There is a story
<>about the devotion of Sukuma1ra to his teacher. Though

<>scold him always. Consequently Sukuma1ra harboured
<>malice in his heart against his teacher. One night
<>Sukuma1ra got on the upper attic of the house of the
<>teacher with a big stone. His aim was to drop the
<>stone on the head of the teacher. But that night the
<>conversation of the teacher and his wife was about
<>Sukuma1ra. The wife asked the teacher why he was
<>scolding his disciple so often, when he was so dutiful
<>and righteous. The teacher said that he loved him
<>most and that the chastisement was meant to make him
<>better and better. When Sukuma1ra heard this his heart
<>was broken. With tears in his eyes, he got down with
<>the stone and disappeared in darkness.
<NI>Next morning Sukuma1ra had no peace of mind. He
<>approached the teacher. He asked the teacher “What
<>is the punishment destined for him who had tried to
<>kill his teacher?” The teacher replied that he should
<>die a slow death in the fire made by the husk of paddy.
<>Instantly Sukuma1ra made a pit and stood in it and
<>filled the pit with husk up to his neck and set fire to
<>the pile. When the teacher knew that the culprit was
<>Sukuma1ra, he was filled with grief. He tried his best to
<>dissuade his beloved disciple from his attempt. But it
<>was in vain. While he was slowly burning in the fire
<>he composed and sang the great poem ‘S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a [Page762-b+ 64]
<>Vila1sa’. The poet was not able to complete the twelfth
<>Sarga of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a Vila1sa.
<NI>The sixtysixth stanza was the last one he sang. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a was showing Satyabha1ma1, the various countries
<>and describing the prominence of each, when they had
<>reached the earth after obtaining the Pa1rija1ta flowers
<>from the world of the gods. After having described the
<>kingdoms of Pa1n2d2ya and Cola, the poet was beginning
<>to describe the natural beauty of ‘Saptakon3kan2as’ (the

<>time, the place came to be known as “Madhura1”. After
<>S4atrughna's time his two sons ruled over the country.
<>Thus the Solar dynasty came to an end and Mathura1
<>puri1 came under the rule of Yadus. The first King of
<>Yaduvam3s4a was S4u1rasena. Vasudeva, father of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a was the son of this S4u1rasena. After the death of

<>The Ka1lakeyas fell under the sword of Ra1van2a. Enraged

<>Sister! You may travel through the three worlds and

<NI>S4u1rpan2akha1 was pleased. She at once started going [Page769-b+ 64]

<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a; Kambara1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Before Laks2man2a.%} S4u1rpan2akha1's son, S4ambhukuma1ra
<>was performing tapas to S4iva in Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. It was
<>at this time that S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a arrived in the
<>forest, accompanied by Si1ta1. They reached the place
<>called Pan5cavat2i1 in Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. S4ri1 Ra1ma wished
<>to set up his hermitage in the middle of the five “vat2a”
<>trees in Pan5cavat2i1.
<NI>At the very sight of Si1ta1, S4ambhukuma1ra fell in love
<>with her. He stood there in the form of a tree. While
<>building the hermitage, Laks2mana felled that tree and
<>thus S4ambhukuma1ra was killed. (See under S4ambhu-

<NI>The widowed S4u1rpan2akha1, in her search for a suitable
<>husband happened to reach and settle down at the
<>southern border of Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. She had failed in

<NI>It was at this stage that she came to know of S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and his party. She disguised herself as Lalita1 and
<>entered S4ri1 Ra1ma's a1srama. The sight of S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>made her a victim to carnal passion. She submitted
<>her desire to him, but he turned down her prayer. The
<>disappointed S4u1rpan2akha1 left the a1s4rama at once. But
<>she appeared again in front of Si1ta1. Feeling that so long
<>as Si1ta1 was alive, S4ri1 Ra1ma would not be prepared to
<>court her, S4u1rpan2akha1 rushed furiously at Si1ta1.
<NI>Laks2man2a who was watching the whole scene, suddenly
<>rushed to the spot and pushed her out of the a1s4rama.
<>He cut off her ears, nose and breasts.
<NI>S4u1rpan2akha1, bleeding profusely from her mutilation,
<>hastened to her brother Ra1van2a to inform him of the
<>calamity. In obedience to Ra1van2a's command, Khara,
<>Du1s2an2a and others who came and encountered
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, were also slain in the battle.
<>(Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>S4U1RPA1RAKA. Another name for Kerala. In Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 99, we read that Paras4ura1ma threw a
<>“S4u1rpa” winnowing basket from Gokarn2a southwards
<>and the ocean up to the spot where the S4u1rpa fell, be-
<>came dry land. Since the land was formed by throwing
<>the S4u1rpa, it came to be called “S4u1rpa1raka”. References
<>to S4u1rpa1raka in the Maha1bha1rata, are given below:-
<NI>(i) In the course of his triumph of the southern lands,
<>Sahadeva conquered “S4u1rpa1raka”. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 31, Verse 65).
<NI>(ii) There is a sacred bath here, known as “S4u1rpa1raka
<>ti1rtha”. By bathing here, one would obtain golden
<>ra1s4is. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 43).
<NI>(iii) In S4u1rpa1raka Ks2etra, there is a sacrificial platform
<>originally used by Jamadagni. Close by, there are two
<>holy places called “Pa1s2a1n2a ti1rtha” and “Candra ti1rtha”.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 88, Verse 12).
<NI>(iv) Yudhis2t2hira once happened to visit this sacred
<>place. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 118, Verse 8).
<NI>(v) S4u1rpa1raka is the land formed by the withdrawal of
<>the ocean. It is also called “Apara1ntabhu1mi”. (S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 49, Verse 66).
<NI>(vi) Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25,
<>Verse 50 states that by bathing in the water of S4u1rpa1raka
<>Ks2etra and observing a fast for a fortnight, one would
<>be born as a prince in the next birth.
<HI>SURUCA. A son of Garud2a. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>101, Verse 3). [Page770-a+ 65]
<HI>SURUCI. A wife of Utta1napa1da. Sva1yambhuva Manu
<>had two sons called Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da. Utta1na-
<>pa1da married Suruci and Suni1ti. A son called Uttama
<>was born to Suruci and to Suni1ti was born Dhruva,
<>(For details see under Dhruva).
<HI>SURU1PA1. A daughter of Vis4vakarman. Priyavrata, son
<>of Sva1yambhuva Manu married Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1,
<>the beautiful daughters of Vis4vakarman. Suru1pa1 had
<>ten sons. They had a younger sister called U1rjasvati1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>SU1RYA I. The God who gives light to the worlds.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} It is said that the Sun was born to
<>Kas4yapa by his wife Aditi. Maha1vis2n2u begot Brahma1
<>and Brahma1 begot Mari1ci. Praja1pati Kas4yapa was
<>born from Mari1ci. Several sons were born to Kas4yapa
<>by Aditi the daughter of Daks2a. They are known by
<>the names A1dityas, Vasus, Rudras and so on. Of these,
<>A1dityas are tewelve in number. (A1ditya means the son
<>of Aditi). There is a difference of opinion as to who
<>these twelve A1dityas are. According to Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 51, the twelve A1dityas are Varun2a, Su1rya (the
<>Sun), Sahasra1m3s4u, Dha1ta1, Tapana, Savita1, Gabhasti,
<>Ravi, Parjanya, Tvas2t2a1, Mitra and Vis2n2u. (See under
<>Dva1das4a1dityas). But in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65, Stanza 15, it is stated that the twelve
<>A1dityas are Dha1ta1, Aryama1, Mitra, S4ukra, Varun2a,
<>Am3s4a, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1, Savita1 Tvas2t2a1 and
<>Vis2n2u.
<NI>Very often these names are used as synonyms of the Sun.
<>So it is better to assume that there are several A1dityas
<>and that it is the sun who gives light and heat to the
<>worlds. Vivasva1n is this sun because it is said that from
<>this Vivasva1n the Manu Vaivasvata was born and from
<>this Vaivasvata, Iks2va1ku, the first king of the Solar
<>dynasty, was born.
<NI>2 {%The chariot of the Sun.%} The sun rises in the east and
<>sets in the west, in consequence of which days and
<>nights occur. The Pura1n2ic assumption is that the sun
<>travels in a very big chariot. The chariot of the Sun
<>is nine thousand yojanas long. The wheel is fixed to
<>this. The great wheel of time with three centres, five
<>tyres and six spokes, is fixed on that indestructible year.
<>It has seven horses, which are the seven Vedic metres,
<>called by the names Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1,
<>Tr2is2t2ubh, Anus2t2ubh and Pan3kti. Another axle used
<>for the chariot of the Sun is fortyfive thousand five
<>hundred yojanas long. The length of each half of the
<>Yoke is proportionate to the length of the axle. The
<>short axle of the chariot with the small half of the yoke
<>is fixed on Dhruva. The wheel fixed on the other axle
<>rests on the mount Ma1nasottara.
<NI>Separate A1dityas, hermits Gandharvas, celestial maids,
<>Yaks2as, serpents and giants sit, in the chariot of the Sun
<>every month. In the month of Caitra, which is also
<>called Madhuma1sa, the seven officers of the month who
<>travel daily in the chariot, are the A1ditya Dha1ta1, the
<>celestial maid Kratusthala1, the hermit Pulastya, the
<>serpent Va1suki, the Yaks2a Rathabhr2t, the gaint Heti,
<>and the Gandharva Tumburu. In the month of
<>Vais4a1kha also called Ma1dhava, the A1ditya Aryaman,
<>the hermit Pulaha, the Yaks2a Rathaujas, the celestial
<>maid Pun5jikasthala1, the giant Praheti, the serpent
<>Kacavi1ra and the Gandharva Na1rada sit in the chariot.
<>In the month of Jyes2t2ha, the A1ditya Mitra, the hermit
<>Atri, the serpent Taks2aka, giant Paurus2eya, the celes- [Page770-b+ 65]
<>tial maid Menaka1, the Gandharva Ha1ha1, and the Yaks2a
<>Rathasvana, sit in the chariot. In the month of A1s2a1d2ha,
<>the A1ditya Varun2a, the hermit Vasis2t2ha, the serpent
<>Na1ga, the celestial maid Sahajanya1, the Gandharva
<>Hu1hu1, the giant Ratha and the Yaks2a Citraratha,
<>travel in the chariot. In the month of S4ra1van2a, the
<>A1ditya Indra, the Gandharva, Vis4va1vasu, the Yaks2a
<>Srotas, the serpent Ela1putra, the hermit An3giras, the
<>celestial maid Pramloca1, and the giant Sarpi1 travel in
<>the chariot. In the month of Bha1drapada the A1ditya
<>Vivasva1n, the Gandharva, Ugrasena, the hermit Bhr2gu,
<>the Yaks2a, A1pu1ran2a, the celestial maid Anumloca1, the
<>serpent S4an3khapa1la and the giant Vya1ghra sit in the
<>chariot. In the month of As4vani1, the A1ditya Pu1s2a1,
<>the Gandharva Vasuruci, the giant Va1ta, the hermit
<>Gautama, the serpent Dhanan5jaya, the Yaks2a Sus2en2a
<>and the celestial maid Ghr2ta1ci sit in the chariot. In

<>As4vatara, the celestial maid Rambha1, the Gandharva
<>Suvarcas, the Yaks2a Satyajit, the hermit Vis4va1mitra, and
<>the giant Yajn5opeta travel in the chariot. These seven
<>persons live in the region of the Sun in their time.
<>The hermits praise the Sun; the gandharvas sing; the
<>celestial maids dance; the giants walk behind as guards.
<>The serpents prepare the horses to be yoked; the
<>Yaks2as hold the bridle and the Ba1lakhilyas stand round
<>the Sun. These groups of seven in each month are
<>responsible for heat, coldness, rain etc. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Am3s4a 2, Chapter 8).
<NI>3) {%The Vedic figure of the Sun.%} Even though the sun is
<>only one of the seven groups, he is above the others in
<>prominence. The complete power of Vis2n2u is the three
<>Vedas R2g, Yajus and Sa1ma. The power in the form of
<>the three Vedas blazes in the form of the Sun. That
<>power destroys all the sins in the world. Vis2n2u stays
<>inside the sun in the form of R2g, Yajus and Sa1ma for
<>the Sustenance and protection of the world. As said be-
<>fore, the three Vedas are the para1s4akti, or the feminine
<>supreme power of Vis2n2u. She is the three Vedas them-
<>selves. Every month she stays inside that particular
<>A1ditya of the month. In the morning the R2gveda
<>praises the Sun. At noon the Yajurveda praises the Sun
<>and in the evening the Sa1mans such as Br2had Rathantara
<>and so on. The three Vedas R2g, Yajus and Sa1man are
<>portions of Vis2n2u. This power of Vis2n2u stays in A1ditya
<>always. It stays not only in the Sun, but also in the
<>three godheads Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva. At the time
<>of creation Brahma1 was pervaded by R2g. At the time
<>of sustenance, Vis2n2u is pervaded by Yajus. At the end [Page771-a+ 65]
<>Rudra will be pervaded by Sa1man. So the sound of
<>Sa1man will be unpalatable. Thus this Vais2n2avite power
<>which is having the attribute of purity (Sattva) and
<>Vedas, pervades mainly the sun though it remains
<>on the seven groups also. Being the seat of this power,
<>the Sun blazes with his rays and destroys the darkness
<>in all the worlds.
<NI>Such a Sun is praised by the hermits. The Gandharvas
<>sing in front of the Sun. The celestial maids dance
<>before him. The giants guard him, the serpents prepare
<>his chariot, the Yaks2as hold the bridle and the Ba1la-
<>khilyas stand around him. Vis2n2u who is having
<>the figure of the Sun pervaded by the power of the
<>Vedas, never rises or sets. The seven groups are separate
<>from that Vis2n2u. As the figures of those who approach,
<>are reflected in a mirror fixed on a post, that power of
<>Vis2n2u, without separating itself from that chariot,
<>pervades them who come every month in turn. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 11).
<NI>4) {%The direction of the sun.%} The Sun starts from the
<>east and goes to the western ocean. The directions east
<>and west originate from this rising and setting. As a
<>matter of fact when the sun rises in the east it is bright
<>in places behind it. But it does not shine in the palace
<>of Brahma1 on the top of Maha1meru. The rays of the
<>sun which enter the palace are driven back by the
<>radiance of the palace. The Mountain Meru is north to
<>all islands and countries. So on one side of that mount
<>it is always day and on the other side it is always night.
<>When the Sun sets his light enters fire. So at night the
<>light of fire goes far. In the same way, at day time, the
<>light of fire enters the sun. So the sun shines more. Thus
<>because the light of the sun and fire enter each other
<>the day and the night wax when the sun shines on
<>the southern and northern hemi-spheres. The dark nights
<>and bright days enter water gradually. The water seems
<>a little red, in day time because darkness has entered
<>it in the night. After sunset the water seems a little
<>white because the day has entered the water.
<NI>Thus when the sun passes through the middle of the island
<>Pus2kara, the change of the Sun to one thirtieth
<>portion of the earth is called ‘Mauhu1rtikagati’ (covering
<>the distance in a muhu1rta--48 minutes). The sun, like
<>a fly sitting on the circumference of the wheel of a potter
<>travels round the earth inclining a portion of a thirtieth of
<>the earth, and making day and night. In the beginning
<>of the transit to the Tropic of Cancer, the sun passes
<>into the zodiac of Makara, and then to Kumbha and
<>Mi1na. After having completed the three zodiacs, the
<>sun makes the day and night equal and enters Vis2uva.
<>At the end of travelling in the Northern hemi-sphere
<>the sun enters the zodiac of Karkat2aka and transit to
<>the south begins. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 8).
<NI>5) {%The Sun in the clutches of the giants.%} The Sun is being
<>attacked daily by a kind of giants called the Mandehas.
<NI>6) {%Family life.%} The Sun married Sam3jn5a1, the daughter
<>of Vis4vakarma1. Three children Manu, Yama and
<>Yami1 were born to him by Sam3jn5a1. By Cha1ya1, the
<>maid of Sam3jn5a1, three children, S4anais4cara, Manu and
<>Tapati1 were born to the Sun. As4vini1kuma1ras and Revan-
<>ta were born by Sam3jn5a1 to the sun who took the form of
<>a horse. (See under Sam3jn5a1 and Cha1ya1).
<NI>On several occasions other sons such as Sugri1va, Ka1lindi1
<>Karn2a and so on were born to the Sun. (For details see
<>under those entries). [Page771-b+ 65]
<NI>7) {%The rising delayed.%} A story stating that the rising of
<>the sun was delayed because of the curse of S4i1lavati1, is
<>stated in Maha1bha1rata. (See under S4i1lavati1).
<NI>8) {%The Sun and the Syamantaka.%} Once the King Satra1jit
<>did penance and got the jewel Syamantaka from the Sun.
<>(For detailed story see under Prasena).
<NI>9) {%The Sun and Ra1hu.%} Once the Sun and the moon
<>pointed out Ra1hu who had come to partake of the
<>Amr2ta (Ambrosia) in stealth and Mahavis2n2u cut off his
<>head. (For detailed story see under Amr2ta, Para 4).
<NI>10) {%The Sun the teacher of Hanu1ma1n.%} The Sun is the
<>teacher of Hanu1ma1n. (See under Hanu1ma1n).
<NI>11) {%The Sun and Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a happened to
<>reach the Solar region, while he was conducting regional
<>conquest. That night he rested on Maha1meru, and then
<>got into his plane Pus2paka, ready for fight in the
<>morning. Seeing the Sun rising up, Ra1van2a called his
<>minister Prahasta and said to him. “Minister, go and
<>convey my words to the Sun. ‘Ra1van2a has come to fight.
<>Either get down and fight or admit defeat.’ Prahasta
<>walked towards the sun and told the words of the King
<>to the two gate-keepers Pin3gala and Dan2d2i1. The Sun
<>was informed of this by Dan2d2i1. The Sun told Dan2d2i1
<>thus: “Dan2d2i1, I don't mind whether I defeat or I am
<>defeated by Ra1van2a. The thing is, that I have no time.”
<>Dan2d2i1 informed Ra1van2a of this. Ra1van2a went away
<>shouting that he had defeated the Sun.
<NI>12) {%Fight with S4iva.%} See under S4iva Para 7, Sub

<>repeated to Dharmaputra the one hundred and eight
<>names of the Sun. Those names are given in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 3.
<NI>13) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Once Pa1n5ca1li1 worshipped the Sun. The Sun created
<>an unseen giant for her protection. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 15, Verse 19).
<NI>(ii) Pa1n5ca1li1 did penance before the Sun and procured
<>the ‘Aks2ayapa1tra’ (the pot that never became empty).
<>(See under Aks2ayapa1tra).
<NI>(iii) The Sun destroys the ungrateful asuras (demons).
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 108, Verse 16).
<NI>(iv) There is a story connecting the Sun and the South.
<>In days of old the Sun performed a sacrifice according
<>to the Vedas, and to Kas4yapa who was the ministerial
<>priest, he gave the South as daks2in2a1 (offering). So the
<>south got the name ‘Daks2in2a’. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 109, Verse 1).
<NI>(v) The west is the place where the Sun pours his rays
<>after the end of the day. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>110, Verse 2).
<NI>(vi) When Karn2a and Arjuna confronted each other
<>in the battle of Bha1rata, the Sun boasted to Indra that
<>Karn2a would come out victorious. (M.B. Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 87, Stanza 57).
<NI>(vii) The Sun gave Subrahman2ya two attendants
<>named Subhra1ja and Bha1svara. (S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>45, Verse 31).
<NI>(viii) Once S4iva anointed the Sun as the King of all
<>the planets. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 112, Stanza
<>31). [Page772-a+ 65]
<NI>(ix) The Sun once gave Ya1jn5avalkya the boon that he
<>would get knowledge of the Vedas. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 318, Verse 6).
<NI>(x) The story of one who had attained the region of
<>the Sun by ‘Un5chavr2tti’ (Living on the grains fallen on
<>the field) is given in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, a few
<>Chapters from 353, as follows:
<NI>There was a Brahmin in a place called Maha1padma on
<>the banks of the Ganges. He wandered here and there
<>for knowledge of Vedas. Once a hermit met him and
<>directed him towards a Na1ga named Padmana1bha.
<>Padmana1bha is the serpent which supports the chariot
<>of the Sun. The Brahmin-hermit started in search of
<>Padmana1bha. At last he found out his house. But
<>there was the wife of Padmana1bha only. She said that
<>her husband would return within a few days. Accord-
<>ingly he remained on the banks of the Ganges without
<>any food. Padmana1bha returned and both of them met
<>together. The hermit asked the na1ga what he should
<>do in order to get merged in God. The Na1ga replied
<>that he could become one with God by Un5chavr2tti. The
<>Na1ga continued. “The Sun is a god who had invoked
<>into himself a saint who had lived only by the fallen
<>grains in the field. The activities of that Sun are wonder-
<>ful. The hermits and saints attach themselves to the
<>rays of the Sun as birds attach themselves to the
<>branches of trees. The great storms arising from the
<>Sun spread wide in the sky. I saw once a person sitting
<>inside that Sun who was a wonder of wonders. When
<>that person as shining as the Sun came to him in the
<>noon the Sun embraced him and seated him inside him.
<>I asked him who he was. The Sun replied that he was
<>a person who had attained heaven by Un5chavr2tti.”
<>Hearing the advice given by the Na1ga, the Brahmin
<>engaged in Un5chavr2tti and attained heaven.
<NI>(xi) The Sun gave Subrahman2ya shining beauty.
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 86, Verse 23).
<NI>(xii) The Sun gave the hermit Jamadagni an umbrella
<>and slippers. (See under Cherippu).
<NI>(xiii) In olden days when a war between the Devas
<>and the Asuras was drawing near, Ra1hu wounded the
<>Sun and the moon. Along with that the universe fell
<>in darkness, and the asuras began to destroy the Devas.
<>At this time according to the prayer of the gods the
<>hermit Atri assumed the figure of the Moon and made
<>the Sun as shining as of old. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 156, Stanza 2).

<>taught them to his son, hermit S4uka who was a man of
<>abstinence and who was not born of womb. At this time
<>Vya1sa had another disciple named Su1ta. It is stated in
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, that this Su1ta who was a
<>fellowdisciple of S4uka, who had learned all the Pura1n2as

<>directly form Vya1sa, happened to reach Naimis2a1ran2ya
<>once. (See under Naimis2a1ran2ya). Naimis2a1ran2ya is
<>the abode of hermits in the Kali-age. In days of old,
<>hermits, who were miserable because of the evils of Kali-
<>yuga, which was fast approaching, gathered here at the
<>end of Dva1parayuga. They went to the world of Brahma1
<>to consult about the means and ways of preventing the [Page774-b+ 65]
<>evils of Kaliyuga. Having heard their complaints Brahma1
<>brought a wheel of the figure of mind and placing it be-
<>fore the hermits told them thus: “You follow this wheel.
<>The place where this wheel falls down will be a place of
<>purity, which will not be affected by the evils of Kali-
<>age. There you can live in peace, without being affected
<>by the evils of Kali-age till the coming of the Satya-
<>yuga.” Saying these words Brahma1 set the wheel rolling
<>in front of them. The hermits followed it. The wheel
<>rolled on till it reached the earth, fell down and was
<>crumbled to powder in a particular place. That place
<>became famous later under the name Naimis2a1ran2ya.

<>the disciple of Vya1sa. You have learned the eighteen
<>Pura1n2as from Vya1sa We are eager to hear them. So
<>please recite to us the Pura1n2as, the hearing of which
<>will remit all sins and secure heaven.”
<NI>According to this request Su1ta recited the eighteen
<>Pura1n2asto the gathering of the hermits. It is in the form
<>of the teaching of Su1ta to S4aunaka and the others, i.e.
<>in the form of a dialogue between Su1ta and S4aunaka,
<>that the people got the Pura1n2as. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,

<HI>SVADHA1DEVI1. Wife of the Manes. There is a story,
<>as given below, in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, about
<>the birth of this goddess.
<NI>At the beginning of creation Brahma1 created seven
<>groups of Manes of whom four were embodied and
<>three were lustrous ones. The deities called the Manes
<>are the Agnis2va1ttas, the Barhis2adas, the Somapa1s,
<>Yama, Anala, Soma and Aryaman. The S4ra1ddhas
<>(oblations offered to the manes) were stipulated as
<>the food of these manes. It was ordered that the
<>Brahmin who does not make offerings to the manes,
<>will be as mean and despicable as the Brahmin, who
<>has not learned the Vedas, who has not eaten meals
<>presented to an idol in temples, and who has not
<>worshipped Devi1 (goddess), and that he would not be
<>eligible to perform any religious ceremonies. Thus
<>Brahma1 meant S4ra1ddha as food for the manes. But the
<>portion of the rice balls offered by the Brahmins stipulat-
<>ed as the food of the manes, seldom reached them. At
<>last the manes complained to Brahma1. Then Brahma1
<>created a woman of beauty, youth, knowledge and
<>power to grant boons, and of good character, from a
<>portion of pure nature. She was named Svadha1, and
<>was given to the manes as wife. Then Brahmins were
<>ordered to give offerings to the manes only with the
<>spell (Mantra) of Svadha1. When the Brahmins began to
<>do as they were ordered, the manes also began to get
<>food, and they became contented.
<NI>Two daughters named Mena1 and Dha1rin2i1 were born to
<>the manes by Svadha1devi1. It is mentioned in Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 10, that both of the daughters
<>were expounders of Vedas, full of knowledge and the
<>seat of all good qualities.
<HI>SVA1HA1. A daughter of Br2haspati. This Sva1ha1 who was
<>always angry had a son named Ka1ma. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 219, Verse 22).
<HI>SVA1HA1DEVI.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Wife of god Agni (fire). There
<>is a story about the birth of this goddess, as given below,
<>in Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 9.
<NI>In the beginning of creation sufficient arrangements
<>had not been made for food to be supplied to the
<>Devas (gods). They were in misery. At last the devas
<>reached Satyaloka and requested Brahma1 to make some
<>arrangements for their food. Brahma1 pacified them by
<>saying that he would make available to them, the
<>‘havis’ offered by Brahmins as food. Then Brahma1
<>meditated on the Mu1la-Prakr2ti. A particle of Mu1la-
<>Prakr2ti appeared before Brahma1 and asked him what
<>boon he required. Brahma1 said thus:--Oh Goddess!
<>The gods are miserable due to lack of food. The fire
<>is not powerful enough to digest the ‘havis’ offered by
<>Brahmins in the fire so as to convert them as food for
<>the gods. The fire would become powerful to digest the
<>havis only if your esteemed self would reside in fire as
<>the power of digestion. Only the havis offered, with the
<>mantra, (spell) ending with the holy name of your
<>glorious self could be digested by fire and taken to the
<>gods as food, and they could accept it as food. So it is
<>my request that your gracious self would become the
<>power that dwells in fire as the figure of wealth and
<>prosperity, adored by men and gods.”
<NI>But that goddess said that her desire was to get [Page777-b+ 64]
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a as her husband. She did penance to S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a, who appeared and said: “Devi1! you will take
<>birth as the daughter of King Nagnajit in Vara1ha
<>Kalpa (a world-age) and then you will become my
<>wife. Now you have to become the wife of Agni under
<>the name Sva1ha1devi1 and become the power of digestion,
<>and part of the spell (mantra). You and Agni will be
<>worshipped together by all. From that day onwards
<>Sva1ha1devi1 became the wife of Fire. It is mentioned in
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 10, that three sons
<>Pa1vaka, Pavama1na and S4uci, were born to the couple.
<>(See under Devi1).
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 11, Verse 42, that Sva1ha1devi1 remains in the
<>court of Brahma1, glorifying him.
<NI>(ii) Once Sva1ha1devi1 appeared among the wives of
<>hermits. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 225, Verse 7).
<NI>(iii) When Subrahman2ya was anointed as captain of
<>the army, Sva1ha1devi1 also was present. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 13).
<HI>S4VAITREYA. Son of S4vitra1. There is a story in R2gveda,

<HI>SVAKS2A. A region in India, very famous in the
<>Pura1n2as. (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9,
<>Verse 45).
<HI>SVANA. Son of the Agni (fire) called Satya. It is said
<>that this Agni is the agent which causes disease to
<>living things. This agni got the name Svana because
<>human beings produce Svana (pitiable cry) when they
<>are afflicted by diseases. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>219, Verse 15).
<HI>SVANAYA. Son of King Bha1vayavya. The daughter of
<>this King, who is praised in the R2gveda, was married
<>by the hermit Kaks2i1va1n. (For further details see under
<>Kaks2i1va1n I, Other details, Para 6).
<HI>S4VAPHALKA. Father of Akru1ra. Vr2s2n2i, a Ya1dava King
<>had two sons S4vaphalka and Citraka. It was divinely
<>ordained that there would not be epidemics and drought
<>in the place where S4vaphalka lived. Once there was no
<>rain for a period of three years in the land of the King
<>of Ka1s4i1. So the King of Ka1s4i1 took S4vaphalka with him
<>to his country. With his arrival there was rainfall in
<>the land and the King who was pleased at it gave his
<>daughter Ga1ndini1 in marriage to S4vaphalka.
<NI>There is a story about the birth of Ga1ndini1 also.
<>Ga1ndini1 remained in her mother's womb for many
<>years. At last the King of Ka1s4i1 called to the child
<>in the womb and said, “Take birth at once; why do
<>you remain there so long?” The child replied, “I shall
<>come out if you allow me to offer a cow as gift every
<>day.” The King allowed it and the child was born.
<>She was named “Ga1ndini1.” She used to offer the gift of
<>cows to Bra1hman2as daily. After she married S4vaphalka,
<>several sons including Akru1ra were born to her,
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 34, Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).

<NI>2) {%Result of Svapna.%} The Indians believe that there are

<HI>SVA1YAMBHUVA MANU. Son of Brahma1 and the

<>mental son, and S4ataru1pa1 as the mental daughter, of
<>Brahma1. Sva1yambhuva did penance and acquired
<>boons for ruling over the subjects. He married
<>S4ataru1pa1 herself. Brahma1 appointed him as the

<>out any decrease in its radiance. Sva1yambhuva
<>(Brahma1) appreciated the beauty of S4ataru1pa1. He
<>grew amorous. But Brahma1 was ashamed of his
<>feeling, as S4ataru1pa1 being half of his body, was his
<>daughter. Being subjected to love and shame at the
<>same time Sva1yambhuva stood there, looking at
<>S4ataru1pa1. To avoid the look of Brahma1, Sataru1pa1
<>moved to one side. Brahma1 had no courage to turn
<>his face to that side. So another face sprang up
<>on that side for him. S4ataru1pa1 turned to four sides
<>and Brahma1 thus got four faces. His amour subsided.
<>When the desire subsided, a man originated from
<>Brahma1. That man is Sva1yambhuva. (For further
<>details see under Manvantara).

<>S4auryas4ulkasvayam3vara. No condition is attached to
<>Iccha1svayam3vara. Anybody may be chosen as husband
<>according to the wish of the bride. Damayanti1 Svayam3-
<>vara is an example of this. In the second it will be
<>stipulated that the bridegroom will have to possess
<>certain qualifications. In Si1ta1-Svayam3vara S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>drew the bow of Tryambaka, and married Si1ta1. This is
<>an example of the second type of Svayam3vara. The

<>At last as suggested by Brahma1 he was born again on
<>earth and after a visit to Agastya re-entered Heaven.
<HI>S4VETA1 VI. A daughter of Daks2a. Ten daughters were

<>of the Ni1la mountain. The region known as “Hiran2ya-
<>kam” is situated to the north of this country. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 6, Verse 37).
<HI>S4VETABHADRA. A Guhyaka (guardian of treasury).

<>mentions that he serves Kubera in Kubera's assembly.
<>He was the guardian of Kubera's treasury.
<HI>S4VETADVI1PA. An island. It was on this island that
<>Maha1vis2n2u performed his austere tapas for obtaining
<>“Brahma Vidya1”. It is situated on the northern side of
<>the ocean of milk. It is 32,000 miles above Meru
<>mountain. The inhabitants of S4vetadvi1pa are without
<>the sense organs. They do not take food They are rich
<>in “Jn5a1na” (knowledge). Their bodies give out perpe-
<>tual fragrance. These sinless people are of white com-
<>plexion. Their bodies and bones are as hard as
<>Vajra1yudha. Their heads are as broad and flat as
<>umbrellas and their voice as loud as thunder. Each of
<>them has four arms and sixty teeth. All of them worship
<>S4iva. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Chapter
<>335).
<HI>S4VETAKETU. A Mahars2i.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} S4vetaketu was the son of the sage A1run2i or
<>Udda1laka who was born in the Gautama clan. S4veta-
<>ketu had a sister named Suja1ta1. As2t2a1vakra was her son
<>by the sage, Kahot2aka. Thus S4vetaketu was As2t2a1vakra's
<>uncle. S4vetaketu and As2t2a1vakra grew up together in
<>Udda1laka's a1s4rama. (See under As2t2a1vakra). [Page780-b+ 64]
<NI>2) {%Pride perishes.%} Under his father's training S4veta-
<>ketu became a great scholar. With the increase in his
<>scholarship, he became very proud. The father who
<>understood this called him to his side and asked him:-
<>“By studying all about what you can see, hear and
<>understand, have you learnt anything about what you
<>cannot see, hear or understand?” S4vetaketu admitted
<>that he did not know. Then Udda1laka explained to
<>him the mystery of Parama1tma1 (universal soul) which
<>is without beginning or end. (Cha1ndogyopanis2ad).
<NI>3) {%S4vetaketu in Pa1n5ca1la.%} After completing his education
<>under his father, S4vetaketu went to Pa1n5ca1la. There, in
<>the royal assembly Jaivali, the Prava1han2a King asked
<>him the following questions:--“Where do people go
<>from this world? How do they return? Where do
<>Devaya1na and Pitr2ya1na meet? From where do they
<>diverge? Why is Pitr2loka imperfect? What is the fifth
<>yajn5abali?”
<NI>S4vetaketu answered that he did not know because his
<>father had not taught him these things. Then he went
<>to his father A1run2i and told him about his failure to
<>answer these questions. The father admitted that he
<>too did not know them and suggested that they should
<>ask Prava1han2a himself. Since S4vetaketu refused to go
<>with him to see the King, Udda1laka himself went to
<>Pra1vahan2a. The King enlightened him on the above
<>topics and sent him back. (Cha1ndogyopanis2ad 1. 8).
<NI>4) {%A1ca1rya of Yajn5a Rules.%} In Kaus2i1taki Bra1hman2a,
<>S4vetaketu is described as the A1ca1rya of the rules of
<>Yajn5a. He has laid down definite rules and procedures
<>for priests officiating in Yajn5as. Besides, he has suggested
<>the different customs and practices to be observed by
<>Brahmaca1rins and tapasvins. In the treatises dealing with
<>Dharmas4a1stra before his time, food of sweet taste was
<>denied to Brahmaca1rins. But S4vetaketu has pointed
<>out that it was an entirely wrong doctrine. (Gopatha
<>Bra1hman2a, 1. 33; Sa1m3khya1yana Bra1hman2a, 1. 33).
<NI>Once an a1ca1rya named Ja1tu1kar2n2ya became the priest
<>of the Kings of Ka1s4i1, Kosala and Videha. S4vetaketu
<>who was angry at this complained bitterly about this
<>to his father. Then Udda1laka reminded his son that
<>priests should yearn for wisdom instead of being
<>attracted by worldly pleasures.
<NI>5) {%Author of Ka1mas4a1stra.%} It is more or less clear that
<>it was S4vetaketu who abridged the original work on
<>Ka1mas4a1stra by Nandi, into 500 chapters. This abridge-
<>ment of S4vetaketu was again abridged after some years
<>by Ba1bhravya. It was after abridging it again and
<>adding Dattaka1ca1rya's “Vais4ika” and Suvarn2ana1bha's
<>“Sa1mprayogika” etc., that Va1tsya1yana composed his
<>famous treatise “Ka1masu1tra”. Really speaking, the
<>basis of Va1tsya1yana's “Ka1masu1tra” was the works of
<>Ba1bhravya and S4vetaketu on Ka1mas4a1stra.
<NI>It has been observed that the first person who raised
<>his voice against the evils of drinking and adultery by
<>the Bra1hman2a community was S4vetaketu. There is a
<>story in the Maha1bha1rata about the fact which prompt-
<>ed him to bring marriage within the framework of law.
<>S4vetaketu was Udda1laka's son, born to his wife by one
<>of his disciples. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 35, Verse
<>22). Once his mother was abducted by a Bra1hman2a.
<>This incident inspired him to make stringent laws
<>insisting on monogamy for men and women.
<HI>S4VETAKI. A King. He was mostly occupied in perform- [Page781-a+ 65]
<>ing Yajn5as. Maha1bha1rata gives the following details
<>about this yajn5a lover:
<NI>(i) S4vetaki performed numerous Yajn5as. He was a
<>King who was deeply absorbed in Yajn5as. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 222).
<NI>(ii) Once the Yajn5a he performed was so prolonged
<>that the R2tviks were utterly tired and left the Yajn5a in
<>the middle. After that the King had to bring in other
<>R2tviks to complete it. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 225,
<>Verse 21).
<NI>(iii) He worshipped S4iva and propitiated him to get a
<>blessing to enable him to perform many Yajn5as. S4iva
<>advised him that he should do “a1huti” (homa or sacri-
<>fice) in Agni continuously for twelve years. Accepting
<>this advice, the king invited Durva1sas to make arrange-
<>ments for the Yajn5a. Appointing Durva1sas as R2tvik,
<>S4vetaki continued the Yajn5a for a hundred years. (For
<>more information see under Kha1n2d2avada1ha).
<HI>S4VETAPARN2A. King of the city of Bhadra1vati1, which
<>was situated to the east of Hastina1pura. In Jaimini
<>As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 15, it is stated
<>that Bhi1ma after a fight captured and took with him
<>the beautiful horse of this King for the purpose of
<>Yudhis2t2hira's As4vamedha Yajn5a.
<HI>S4VETARAS4MI. An elephant. A Gandharva happened
<>to be born as a white elephant in the Kalin3ga country,
<>as a result of a curse. S4vetaras4mi is the name of that
<>elephant. The King Ratna1dhipa mounted that elephant
<>and did many exploits.
<NI>King Ratna1dhipa was the ruler of the island Ratna-
<>ku1t2a. He was a prominent Vais2n2ava. He did tapas to
<>Vis2n2u with the object of conquering the whole earth
<>and to get all princesses as his wives. Maha1vis2n2u
<>appeared before him and said:--“A Gandharva has been
<>born in the land of Kalin3ga by a curse as a white
<>elephant. His name is S4vetaras4mi. As directed by me,
<>he will come to you. You may ride him and he will
<>take you through the air across the sky. All the Kings
<>against whom you fight, will be defeated and they will
<>offer their daughters to you as tribute.”
<NI>Next day, the elephant S4vetaras4mi descended before him
<>through the air. As advised by Maha1vis2n2u Ratna1dhipa
<>mounted the elephant and conquered the whole world
<>and secured numerous princesses. One day as the King
<>was riding the elephant and travelling through the air,
<>an eagle came and pecked at the forehead of the ele-
<>phant. Ratna1dhipa drove it away by a thrust with his
<>spear. But the elephant fell down unconscious. Even
<>after five days he did not rise. The King offered prayers
<>to the “Lokapa1lakas”. He was about to cut off his own
<>head and offer it as sacrifice to them. Just then he
<>heard a mysterious voice saying:--“Do not be rash;
<>S4vetaras4mi will rise at the touch of a chaste woman.”
<NI>The King at once went to the palace and brought his
<>chief queen who was kept closely guarded and asked
<>her to touch the elephant. But he did not rise. Then
<>he ordered all the rest of his wives in turn to touch the
<>elephant. Still the elephant did not rise. When he found
<>that none of his 80,000 wives was a “chaste woman”,
<>the King was ashamed of himself. Then he brought
<>every one of the women in his kingdom and made them
<>touch the animal one by one. But it was all in vain. At
<>this stage, when Ratna1dhipa was very much depressed,
<>a merchant named Hars2agupta from Ta1mralipti
<>happened to come there. He was accompanied by his [Page781-b+ 65]
<>wife S4i1lavati1. She touched the elephant and immedi-
<>ately it stood up. Ratna1dhipa was very much pleased
<>and married S4i1lavati's sister Ra1jadatta1. After offering
<>many rich presents to S4i1lavati1 and Hars2agupta Ratna1-
<>dhipa took Ra1jadatta1 on the back of S4vetaras4mi to a
<>deserted island Catus4s4a1ladvi1pa and left her there under
<>the protection of several women attendants. The King
<>spent his nights at Catus4s4a1ladvi1pa and days in his own
<>palace.
<NI>One day Ra1jadatta1 was remaining alone in her resi-
<>dence. The attendants had gone out to attend to various
<>duties. At this time a man happened to arrive there
<>from somewhere. He was Bhavanasena, the son of a
<>Vais4ya. He reached the island with the help of a piece
<>of wood which was floating in the sea after a shipwreck.
<>Ra1jadatta1 who heard his story, was irresistibly attract-
<>ed by him and she embraced him. Just then the King
<>arrived on the scene. Consoling himself by thinking
<>that this was also the will of Fate, he let off the Vais4ya
<>youth.
<NI>The King returned to his palace and decided to spend
<>the rest of his life by doing tapas in the forest, after
<>giving away all his wealth and property to the poor.
<>When he was about to mount S4vetaras4mi, the animal
<>suddenly transformed itself into a man of divine glory,
<>dressed in gorgeous clothes and jewels. He spoke to the
<>King as follows:--“I am a Gandharva. My name is
<>Somaprabha. There is my elder brother Devaprabha
<>who lives on the Malaya mountain. My brother had a
<>wife named Ra1javati1. Once all the three of us went to
<>worship in a Vis2n2u temple at a place called Siddha1-
<>va1sa. At that time my sister-in-law sang a devotional
<>song. A Siddha who was enchanted by her song was
<>looking fixedly at her. Enraged at it, my brother asked
<>the Siddha why he was staring at his wife with lustful
<>eyes. The innocent Siddha was naturally provoked by
<>the question and pronounced a curse that my brother
<>and his wife would be born in human wombs and in
<>that birth, he would see his wife having sexual union
<>with a stranger. When I heard my brother being cursed
<>I became very angry. I hurled a toy elephant which
<>was in my hand at the time, at the Siddha. He then
<>cursed me also to become a white elephant just like
<>the toy with which I hit him. I am that younger
<>brother and you are my elder brother. This Ra1jadatta1,
<>your queen was my sister-in-law Ra1javati1. Our curse
<>is now over.” As soon as he concluded, all the three
<>of them renounced their earthly bodies and were restored
<>to their original forms. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Ratna-
<>prabha1lambaka, Taran3ga 2).

<HI>TAKS2AKA I. A fierce serpent.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from
<>Vis2n2u--Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Taks2aka.
<NI>Kas4yapamuni got of his wife Kadru1 serpents and
<>Taks2aka was one of the serpent chiefs. (S4loka 5, Chap-
<>ter 35, A1di Parva). See also under Kadru1).
<NI>2) {%Taks2aka and Pari1ks2it.%} In his boyhood Taks2aka went
<>out from the family. The reason was a curse by his
<>mother. Once Kadru1 and Vinata1, another wife of
<>Kas4yapa, entered into a controversy regarding the
<>colour of the hair of the tail of the horse Uccais4s4ravas.
<>Kadru1 said, it was black and Vinata1 said it was white.
<>It was decided that she who lost the wager should
<>become the servant of the other. That night Kadru1
<>called her children and asked them to go and hang on
<>the tail of the horse so that it should appear black.
<>Some of the righteous children opposed this deceitful
<>attempt of their mother and refused to go. Kadru1
<>cursed them saying that they would be burnt to death
<>at the Sarpasatra of Janamejaya. Kadru1 sent those
<>children out from home and Taks2aka became their
<>leader.
<NI>At that time Pari1ks2it (King of Bha1rata) became the
<>victim of a curse that he would die by the bite of
<>Taks2aka within seven days. (To know more details
<>regarding this curse of the sage see under A1sti1ka). The
<>worried King in consultation with his ministers decided
<>to take protective measures. At first he moved to a
<>seven-storeyed palace and stayed on the seventh storey.
<>Physicians of fame and those well-versed in mantras
<>were posted at the palace. Brahmins were put on duty
<>for prayers. The entire palace and precincts were
<>guarded by huge elephants. Security arrangements
<>were such that even wind found it impossible to enter
<>the palace without permission. The King did all his
<>daily routine activities in the palace itself. [Page783-a+ 64]
<>At that time Kas4yapa [There is a version that it was
<>Dhanvantari who was thus sent back by Taks2aka. 9th
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata] was the greatest of all
<>physicians and ma1ntrikas and, greedy that he was, he
<>started to the palace of Pari1ks2it thinking that it would
<>be the best opportunity to obtain some money from the
<>King. Taks2aka also was going to the palace in the guise
<>of a brahmin. On the way Taks2aka met Kas4yapa and
<>knowing well that the presence of the celebrated
<>Kas4yapa at the palace would be an obstacle to the
<>achievement of his mission, he approached Kas4yapa.
<>They talked on the way and Kas4yapa said he was going
<>to the palace to save the King from the bite of Taks2aka.
<>Then Taks2aka, revealing his identity, said that it was
<>impossible to save anybody from the result of his bite.
<>Both then decided to test their skill then and there. A
<>huge banyan tree with many branches spreading wide
<>was standing nearby and Taks2aka gave it a bite.
<>Within seconds the huge tree was charred to destruct-
<>ion; Kas4yapa then took some water and reciting a
<>mantra poured the water over the ashes of the tree and
<>then to the surprise of Taks2aka, the tree rose up and
<>stood in its original form. On seeing that Taks2aka
<>confessed that Kas4yapa was superior to him. Taks2aka
<>then coaxed him to his side and giving him a huge
<>amount as bribe bade him return home.
<NI>Six days went by and on the seventh day Taks2aka
<>reached the palace of Pari1ks2it. He found the palace
<>well-guarded and watched. There was no way to go in.
<>Taks2aka then called all his relatives and had them
<>disguised as brahmins. He sent them in with fruits and
<>roots, like people who had come to pay homage to the
<>King. Taks2aka crept into one of the most attractive of
<>the fruits as a tiny worm. The guards at the gate stop-
<>ped them. The fake brahmins then said that they had
<>come a long way from a far off tapovana and should be
<>allowed to see the King. The information was carried
<>to the King. The King said he would see the brahmins
<>the next day but ordered their gifts to be brought to
<>him. When the fruits and roots were brought to him,
<>he gave a fruit each to the ministers, himself taking
<>the most beautiful fruit of the lot. When he cut the
<>fruit open he saw a worm with two black eyes and a
<>red body sitting inside it and was a bit surprised. Then
<>he addressed his ministers thus: “Oh, best of ministers,
<>by your earnest and sincere endeavour nothing has
<>happened to me till now. The Sun is going to set and
<>the term of the curse is going to end. There is no need
<>to be afraid of any poison now. But let not a curse of
<>a sage go futile. Let this worm bite me and fulfill the
<>curse.” So saying the King took the worm and placed
<>it on his neck. The worm changed itself into the fierce
<>Taks2aka and bit the King and the King fell down
<>dead. (12th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How Taks2aka became Indra's friend.%} Once the son of
<>a sage of great divine splendour named Uttan3ka was
<>studying under a Guru named Veda. When his edu-
<>cation was complete, the Guru asked him to bring
<>as daks2in2a1 (fees) the ear-rings worn by the Ks2atriya
<>wife of King Paus2ya. Indra made Taks2aka steal the
<>ornament and created many obstacles on the way.
<>(For details see under Uttan3ka). That incident made
<>them mutual friends and gradually Taks2aka became an
<>intimate friend of Indra. [Page783-b+ 64]
<>From that day onwards Uttan3ka waited for an oppor-
<>tunity to take vengeance on Taks2aka. It was at that
<>time that Janamejaya, son of Pari1ks2it, became the king.
<>Janamejaya was only eleven years old when he became
<>king and he was not then aware of the details of the
<>death of his father. Uttan3ka went to him and told
<>him how Taks2aka killed his father. Janamejaya became
<>furious and asked him how to wreak vengeance on him.
<>Uttan3ka suggested the performance of a Sarpasatra to
<>which all the serpents should be attracted by mantras
<>and burnt to death there. The young king agreed and
<>Uttan3ka with other r2s2is commenced the Sarpasatra.
<NI>One by one all the serpents came and fell into the sacri-
<>ficial fire but Taks2aka was not to be found. Where is
<>Taks2aka? This question was heard from many lips.
<>Taks2aka was specially invoked by Uttan3ka. Taks2aka
<>could not bear the power of Uttan3ka and he ran and
<>prostrated before Indra. Indra not only did give refuge
<>but gave him half of his seat in the throne and Taks2aka
<>sat on it fully confident of security. Uttan3ka was
<>enraged, when after repeated calls by mantra, Taks2aka
<>did not appear and so he sat in meditation for some
<>time to know the cause. He then saw Taks2aka sitting
<>on the throne of Indra and the sight threw him into
<>fury and he invoked Taks2aka, Indra and the throne
<>and all. Lo! in an instant Indra, Taks2aka, the throne
<>and all started moving towards the sacrificial fire!
<>Within seconds all would have been burnt to death
<>but for the timely intervention of a brahmin boy named
<>A1sti1ka, son of the sage Jaratka1ru. (See under A1sti1ka,
<>Taks2aka escaped death that time).
<NI>Taks2aka by instructions from Indra was living in the
<>forest of Kha1n2d2ava and when that was burnt by Agni,
<>it was Indra who saved Taks2aka from the fire. (See
<>under Kha1n2d2avada1ha).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) A king called Candra1n3gada lived in the house of
<>Taks2aka for some time. (See under Candra1n3gada).
<NI>(ii) Taks2aka in the guise of a brahmin named Ks2apa-
<>n2aka went to the sage Uttan3ka and stole the ornaments
<>from him. (See under Uttan3ka).
<NI>(iii) Once the Earth was made into a cow and every-
<>body milked from her what each wanted. The serpents
<>milked poison from her and they then used Taks2aka as
<>the calf. (See under Pr2thu).
<NI>(iv) During the burning of the forest of Kha1n2d2ava,
<>Arjuna slew the wife of Taks2aka. (See under Kha1n2d2a-
<>vada1ha).
<NI>(v) When the soul of Balabhadrara1ma, after his death,

<HI>TAKS2AKA II. The elder of the two sons of Laks2man2a
<>of his wife U1rmila1. The other was Chatraketu. Follow-
<>ing the instructions of S4ri1 Ra1ma, Laks2man2a went to the
<>east sea coast, defeated the forest tribe there. He then
<>constructed a city there named Agati and made Taks2aka
<>the king there. He then went to the west sea-coast
<>and destroying the barbarous tribe there constructed a
<>city there called Candramati1 and made Chatraketu
<>(? candraketu) the king. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>TAKS2AS4ILA1. A place of Pura1n2ic celebrity situated in the
<>north-west of Bha1rata. Even from ancient times this [Page784-a+ 65]
<>was an educational and cultural centre. From the des-
<>criptions of the Chinese traveller Huen Tsang it is found
<>that Nalanda1 and Taks2as4ila1 were two great universities
<>before Christ. The famous Sarpasatra of Janamejaya
<>was conducted at this place situated on the banks of
<>the river Vitasta1. The story of Maha1bha1rata was first
<>told at this place and at the end of the narration Brah-
<>mins were given gifts. (Chapters 3 and 5, A1di Parva).
<HI>TA1LA. A hell. There are many hells under water includ-
<>ing Ta1la. (Chapter 6, Am3s4a 2, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>TA1LACARA. A place of human habitation in ancient
<>Bha1rata. (S4loka 26, Chapter 140, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>TA1LADHVAJA. The phantom husband of Na1rada. Once
<>Na1rada became a woman and a king called Ta1ladhvaja
<>married her (Devi1 Pura1n2a). It was to show how the
<>mind is covered with illusion that Maha1vis2n2u made
<>Na1rada into a woman.
<NI>Once Na1rada went to Maha1vis2n2u and asked him about
<>the secret of life. Maha1vis2n2u said that there was nothing
<>called life and life exists because of Ma1ya1 the illusion
<>of the mind. Na1rada insisted that he should see ‘Ma1ya1’
<>(illusion) and so Vis2n2u started from Vaikun2t2ha with
<>Na1rada on the back of Garud2a.
<NI>Crossing forests, rivers, cities, lakes, villages and mount-
<>ains they reached Kanya1kubja. There they saw a
<>beautiful lake. Garud2a landed and Vis2n2u and Na1rada
<>got down. They walked along the shore of the lake
<>for some time and then they sat beneath a tree for some
<>time. After some time Maha1vis2n2u asked Na1rada to
<>take a bath in the lake. Pleased at this command
<>Na1rada placed his violin and deer-hide on the shore
<>and after first washing his face and feet and doing
<>‘a1camana’ with Kus4a grass in his hand stepped into
<>the water for his bath. Maha1vis2n2u stood near the violin
<>and deer-hide of Na1rada and Na1rada dipped himself in
<>the water. What a surprise! Na1rada was changed into
<>a woman of great beauty. She had no memory of her
<>previous birth and getting herself on to the shore she
<>stood there watching the surroundings there. Then a
<>king called Ta1ladhvaja came on horse-back that way.
<>He addressed the beautiful woman as Saubha1gyasundari1
<>and started talking with her. Within hours they got
<>married and Ta1ladhvaja took her to his palace and
<>spent the honey-moon there happily. Twelve years went
<>by and Saubha1gyasundari1 became pregnant. In due
<>course she got a son named Vi1ravarma1. After another
<>two years she got another son named Sudharma1. Thus
<>she delivered a son every two years for twentyfour
<>years becoming the mother of twelve sons. After some
<>time she bore eight more sons also. When all the twenty
<>sons came of age they were married according to the
<>custom and in due course those sons also got sons. Thus
<>Ta1ladhvaja and Saubha1gyasundari1 became the heads of
<>a large family of children and grand-children and lived
<>happily. One day a king from a far-off place with a
<>great army suddenly came and surrounded Kanya1kubja.
<>In the fight that ensued most of the sons and grand-sons
<>of Saubha1gyasundari1 were killed. The king fled from
<>the battlefield and came to the palace. Saubha1gyasundari1
<>was in great distress and when the enemies left the battle-
<>field she secretly went there to have a last look at her
<>sons and grandsons lying dead. The sight terrified her.
<>They lay there without heads, hands or legs, eyes pro-
<>truded, stomach cut open, intestines lying out and blood
<>oozing out from everywhere. She fell to the ground [Page784-b+ 65]
<>and wept bitterly. Then Maha1vis2n2u came there dis-
<>guised as an old brahmin and talked to her. He gave
<>her instructions on some truths about life. Saubha1gya-
<>sundari1 then called Ta1ladhvaja and they both went to
<>the old lake and as instructed by the old brahmin
<>Saubha1gyasundari1 took a dip in the water. Lo! she
<>became the old Na1rada.
<NI>When Na1rada got up from the lake Maha1vis2n2u was
<>still standing near his violin and deer-skin smiling at
<>him. The sight of Vis2n2u gave him knowledge of all
<>that had happened. He stood there recounting in his
<>memory how he had requested Vis2n2u to show him
<>Ma1ya1 and how he had taken a bath in that lake and
<>how he had spent a long period of married life ending
<>in misery and how Vis2n2u had come to her in the form
<>of an old brahmin when she had cried to him in agony
<>and how the old brahmin had taken her and Ta1ladh-
<>vaja to the lake again and how he had become his
<>old self again. He stood there still pondering over these
<>when Vis2n2u called him and said “Come on Na1rada,
<>how slow you are. Finish your bath and come soon.
<>What are you thinking about?” Ta1ladhvaja, however,
<>was unmoved by any of these. He was puzzled to find
<>a bearded Sannya1si1 rising up from the place where his
<>beautiful wife had dipped herself for a bath. He went
<>to Na1rada and asked “Oh best of sages, where is my
<>wife who has just dipped herself in this same place?
<>From where do you come?” Even before waiting to
<>hear a reply from him the King began to make a hue
<>and cry about the loss of his wife. Then Maha1vis2n2u
<>went to him and consoled him by saying with illustra-
<>tions that ‘human ties are only ephemeral’ and asked
<>him to take a bath in the lake. Ta1ladhvaja after his
<>bath became disgusted with life and after doing penance
<>in the forests attained moks2a. (8th Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).

<>enters the life of all animate and inanimate objects. The
<>attributes of Tamas are greed, sleep, bravery, cruelty
<>disbelief in god, bad habits, begging and indifference.
<>It is because of the action of tamogun2a that one be-
<>comes a prey to lust. It is the worst result of ta1masic
<>activities that people are born as inanimate objects,
<>worms, insects, fishes, serpents, tortoises, cows and deer.
<>As a better result of Ta1masic activities people are born
<>as elephants, horses, S4u1dras, barbarous people, lions,
<>tigers and hogs. It is the good result of ta1masic deeds
<>that produce pilgrims, good castes, egoistic people,
<>demons and devils. (Chapter 2, Manusmr2ti).
<HI>TAMASA1. A sacred river. People of Bha1rata were using
<>the water of this river for drinking. (S4loka 3, Chapter

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u are
<>Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Su1rya--Tapati1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Su1rya married Sam3jn5a1 daughter of Vis4va-
<>karma1. He begot of Sam3jn5a1 two children named
<>Ka1lindi1 and Yama. At that time Su1rya (Sun) was not
<>of the form as seen now. Sam3jn5a1, unable to bear the
<>splendour of Su1rya who was of the shape of an egg
<>entrusted her maid Cha1ya1 with the work of serving her
<>husband and left for a temple in the guise of a mare to [Page786-a+ 63]
<>do penance. Cha1ya1 disguised as Sam3jn5a1 served Su1rya
<>for a very long period. Su1rya begot of her two child-
<>ren, S4anais4cara and Tapati1. Besides these, Su1rya had
<>another daughter named Sa1vitri1 also. (Chapter 47,
<>Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} There was a mighty king in the Lunar
<>race called R2ks2a in the beginning of Kr2tayuga. He
<>had a son named Sam3varan2a. He was made king of
<>his country by his father even while he was a boy.
<>He was a pious and righteous man. Vasis2t2ha was his
<>Guru and he taught Sam3varan2a the Vedas along with
<>the An3gas.
<NI>Once Sam3varan2a entrusting the administration of the
<>state to Vasis2t2ha went to do penance in the forests. On
<>his way he followed a deer for a long distance on horse-
<>back and reached a deep forest named Vaibhra1ja
<>alone. There he saw a lotus pond full of blossomed
<>lotuses and Kalha1ra flowers. Celestial maidens were
<>playing there without interruption. Among them he
<>saw a very beautiful maiden. She was Tapati1 daugh-
<>ter of Su1rya. Even at first sight they became lovers.
<>The king looking at her lost his balance and fell from
<>the horse. At once great and charming Gandharvas
<>approached the king and sprinkling water on his face
<>brought him back from swoon. Tapati1 was also upset
<>and the other nymphs took her to her father's house
<>and consoled her.
<NI>Sam3varan2a returned on horse-back to his residence
<>the city of Pratis2t2ha1. But the king neither slept nor ate
<>any food. The sage Vasis2t2ha knew that all the ail-
<>ments of the king were due to his love for Tapati1,
<>daughter of Su1rya. So he flew up by his yogic powers
<>and met Su1rya sitting in his chariot in all splendour.
<>The sage described to Su1rya the love affair between
<>Sam3varan2a and Tapati1 and pleaded on behalf of the
<>king for giving Tapati1 to Sam3varan2a. Su1rya was
<>pleased to hear that and sent Tapati1 along with
<>Vasis2t2ha to Sam3varan2a. Before long the marriage of
<>Tapati1 with Sam3varan2a was celebrated solemnly at
<>Pratis2t2ha1nagara. The celebrated emperor Kuru was
<>the son born to Tapati1 of Sam3varan2a. (Chapter 21,
<>Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<NI>4). {%How she got that name.%} Because she was the
<>daughter of Su1rya who makes the sky hot (tapa) by
<>his brilliance, she was called Tapati1. (S4loka 6, Chapter
<>171, A1di Parva).
<NI>5). {%Tapati1 becomes river Narmada1.%} S4u1rya, father of
<>Tapati1, blessed her and said she would thereafter
<>flow west from the Vindhya as a river named Narmada1.
<>The present holy river Narmada1 is but Tapati1devi1
<>transformed. (Chapter 47, Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<HI>TA1PATYA. Kuru was the son born to king Sam3varan2a
<>of his wife Tapati1. All the descendants of Kuru were
<>known as Kauravas and because they were of the
<>generation of Tapati1, they were known as Ta1patyas also.
<>The young Gandharva, Citraratha, who fought against
<>Arjuna on the banks of the river, Gan3ga1 addressed
<>Arjuna as Ta1patya. (S4loka 79, Chapter 169, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>TAPOLOKA. The place of abode of Vaira1jas who could
<>not be burnt by fire. This is above Dhruvapada by

<HI>TAPTAKUMBHA. A hell. There are twentyeight hells

<HI>TAPTAMU1RTI. A hell. (See the section Naraka under

<HI>TA1RA. A monkey who was a devotee of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>This big monkey was the son of Br2haspati. Br2haspati
<>made this monkey greater in size and intellect than
<>all other monkeys. This Ta1ra was the minister of Ba1li.
<>(S4loka 10, Sarga 17, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a
<>and Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a). In the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle
<>this monkey fought against the demon Nikharvat2a.
<>(S4loka 9, Chapter 285, Vana Parva).
<HI>TA1RA1 I. Wife of Ba1li, best of Va1naras (monkeys).
<>There are two stories different from each other regard-
<>ing the birth of Ta1ra1. One version is that Ta1ra1 was
<>born during the churning of the Milk-Ocean.
<>Aira1vata, Uccais4s4ravas, Kalpavr2ks2a, Cinta1man2i,
<>Kaustubha, Candra, Apsarases, Maha1laks2mi1 Ta1ra1
<>and Ruma1 rose from the sea of Milk. (Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a). The second version is
<>that Ta1ra1 was the daughter of Sus2en2a. Ba1li at the time
<>of his death is said to have spoken thus of his wife Ta1ra1
<>“Ta1ra1, daughter of Sus2en2a, is well learned and is
<>capable of assessing a situation and suggesting the
<>correct thing to be done at that time. If she says a
<>thing is good, it is never otherwise.” (Chapter 22,
<>Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a). From this it
<>can be understood that Ta1ra1 was the daughter of
<>Sus2en2a and we get an idea of the character of Ta1ra1 also
<>from this. (See under Ba1li).
<HI>TA1RA1 II. Wife of Br2haspati. She was extremely beauti-
<>ful. Once she fell in love with Candra (Moon) and
<>leaving her husband started living with him. Candra
<>was the disciple of Br2haspati. The devas were angry
<>when they found the wife of their preceptor staying
<>with a disciple of his. Br2haspati sent word to her to
<>return home but she did not heed. At last the Devas
<>decided to fight against Candra. Then they came to a
<>compromise and Ta1ra1 was sent back to Br2haspati. In
<>due course Ta1ra1 delivered a son. He was Budha, father
<>of Puru1ravas. There arose then a dispute between
<>Candra and Br2haspati regarding the fatherhood of the
<>child. Then the Devas called Ta1ra1 and asked her to
<>name the child's father. Ta1ra1 said that the child was
<>of Candra and so Budha was looked after at the house
<>of Candra. (9th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>TA1RA1DATTA1. Wife of Kalin3gadatta, King of Taks2as4ila1
<>situated on the shores of the river Vitasta1. Once a
<>celestial maiden named Surabhidatta1 came to be born
<>as the daughter of Ta1ra1datta1 due to a curse of Indra.
<>She was then called Kalin3gasena1. (See under Dharma-
<>datta).
<HI>TA1RAKA (TA1RAKA1SURA) I. An asura chief (demon).
<>This demon even while he was very young did penance
<>to propitiate S4iva and got a boon to the effect that
<>none other than a son born to S4iva should be able to
<>kill him. He became arrogant with the power of this
<>boon and soon became a terror to the world. Then to
<>kill Ta1raka1sura Subrahman2ya was born as the son of
<>S4iva. In the great battle between the devas and the asuras
<>Ta1raka was killed by Subrahman2ya.
<NI>Ta1raka1sura was the father of Ta1ra1ks2a, Kamala1ks2a and
<>Vidyunma1lika. (See under Subrahman2ya). (S4loka 5,
<>Chapter 33, Karn2a Parva). [Page787-a+ 64]
<HI>TA1RAKA II. S4iva Pura1n2a mentions about a Ta1raka,
<>son of the minister of Bhadrasena, a King of Kashmir.
<>This Ta1raka was the rebirth of a he-fowl. Bhadrasena
<>had a son named Sudharma1. He was the rebirth of a
<>monkey. There is a story regarding how this fowl and
<>the monkey came to be born in Kashmir as above.
<NI>Once in the village of Nanda there was a prostitute
<>named Maha1nanda1. Though she was a great devotee
<>of S4iva she was living the life of a prostitute for her
<>livelihood. She was having a monkey and a he-fowl
<>as pets. She would adorn the necks of her pets with
<>the rudra1ks2a necklace (rosary) made of berry beads
<>favourite of S4iva and when she sang songs in praise of
<>S4iva those pets danced to the tune.
<NI>One day a Vais4ya came there. He had a diamond S4iva
<>lin3ga with him. Maha1nanda1 felt a great fancy for that
<>and so promised the Vais4ya that if he gave her the
<>diamond lin3ga she would remain a faithful wife to him
<>for three days. The Vais4ya agreed and the diamond
<>lin3ga was kept in a very secure place That night when
<>both the Vais4ya and Maha1nanda1 were sleeping tired
<>after a hectic amorous sport, the house got fire and the
<>diamond was burst into pieces. The Vais4ya greatly
<>griefstricken by the loss of the diamond, jumped into the
<>fire and committed suicide. Maha1nanda1 faithful to the
<>promise that she would remain his wife for three days
<>started to jump into the fire and abandon her life. At
<>once S4iva appeared before her in person and said thus:
<>“Oh, Maha1nanda1, do not commit suicide. I came to
<>you disguised as a Vais4ya to test your devotion. You
<>can now ask of me any boon.”
<NI>With tears of joy running down her cheeks she said
<>she wanted to live with S4iva. So S4iva carried her soul
<>to Kaila1sa. Not only that, S4iva blessed the fowl and
<>monkey and said they would be born as devotees of S4iva
<>in their next birth and attain moks2a at the end of their
<>life on earth. Accordingly the monkey and the fowl were
<>born in Kashmir as Sudharma1 and Ta1raka.
<HI>TA1RA1KS2A (TA1RAKA1KS2A). A son of the demon
<>Ta1raka1sura. This demon was the lord of a golden city
<>called Tripura. S4iva killed him during Tripuradahana
<>(burning of the Tripuras). See under Tripuradahana.
<>(Chapters 33, 34, Karn2a Parva).
<HI>TARALA. A place of habitation of ancient Bha1rata.
<>This place was conquered by Karn2a. (S4loka 20, Chapter
<>8, Karn2a Parva).
<HI>TARANTUKA. A Yaks2a. This Yaks2a is installed on
<>the boundary of Kuruks2etra. If one spends one night
<>in this holy place one would get the benefit of giving
<>away a thousand cows as gifts. (Chapter 83, Vana
<>Parva).
<HI>TA1RKS2YA I. Garud2a. See under Garud2a.
<HI>TA1RKS2YA II. A sage. He was a member of the court
<>of Indra. He was known as Aris2t2anemi also. He had no
<>fear of death. He once discussed with Sarasvati1devi1
<>about the soul. (Chapter 184, Vana Parva).
<HI>TA1RKS2YA III. A Ks2atriya youth of the country of
<>Ta1rks2ya. He came to the Ra1jasu1ya of Yudhis2t2hira and
<>gave much wealth for the purpose. (S4loka 15, Chapter
<>53, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>TA1RKS2YA IV. A synonym of S4iva. (S4loka 98, Chapter
<>17, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>TARUN2AKA. A serpent born of the family of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra. This serpent was burnt to death at the Sarpa- [Page787-b+ 65]
<>satra of Janamejaya. (S4loka 19, Chapter 57, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>TA1T2AKA1. A fierce demoness. It was because of a curse
<>of the sage Agastya that Ta1t2aka1 became a demoness.
<NI>There was once a great Yaks2a named Suketu, a son of
<>Suraks2a. He did penance to propitiate Brahma1 to get
<>a child and by the blessing of Brahma1 Suketu got a
<>daughter named Ta1t2aka1. Brahma1 gave her the strength
<>of a thousand elephants. Tat2aka1 was by nature interest-
<>ed in cruel and violent deeds and doing deeds of magic.
<>She made Sunda, son of Jharjha, her husband. She got
<>two sons named Ma1ri1ca and Suba1hu. They also became
<>mighty ones great in deeds by magic.
<NI>Once Sunda attacked the a1s4rama of Agastya in a mood
<>of intoxicated arrogance. Sunda was burnt to death in
<>the fire of his fury. Ta1t2aka1 coming to know of the death
<>of her husband got angry and attacked the a1s4rama of
<>Agastya with her sons. Agastya cursed them and made
<>them into demons. Ta1t2aka1 and her sons who immedia-
<>tely turned themselves into fierce-looking demons went
<>first to Pa1ta1la with Suma1li1, father of the demon race
<>and then went with Ra1van2a, King of the demons, to
<>Lan3ka1 and stayed there. With the help of Ra1van2a,
<>Ta1t2aka1 conquered the great deep forest near Ka1ru1s2a and
<>stayed there with her sons. None, devas, demons
<>or men, dared to step into that forest. Even the Sun
<>or Clouds avoided passing above that forest.
<NI>It was at that time that S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a came
<>to that forest with Vis4va1mitra. Ta1t2aka1 attacked S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and Ra1ma killed her with one arrow. The heavy body
<>of the demoness fell to the ground like a big mountain.
<>Her soul then rose up as a beautiful Gandharva lady
<>and Ta1t2aka1 who was thus released from the curse praised
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma and left the place. Chapters 24 to 26 of Ba1la
<>Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a and Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>TA1T2AKA1YANA. A Brahmava1di1 son of Vis4va1mitra.
<>(S4loka 56, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>TA1T2AN3KA. The name of Sim3hadhvaja, King of
<>Sim3hala, in his previous birth. (See under Sim3ha-
<>dhvaja).
<HI>TEJAS4CAN2D2A. A deva who adorns the god Su1rya with a
<>flower garland daily. The idol of Teja can2d2a is also used
<>to be installed in temples. The idol is figured as one
<>with a huge face and holding a sword and a lotus in his
<>hands. (Chapter 51, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>TEJASVATI1 I. A heroine in a story in Katha1saritsa1gara
<>intended to show that all happenings either good or bad
<>are but the workings of fate.
<NI>Tejasvati1 was the daughter of king Vikramasena of
<>Ujjayini1 and was very beautiful. She never liked any
<>male and so never wished to marry. One day while
<>she was sitting upstairs in her palace, she happened to
<>see a young man passing that way and surprisingly was
<>attracted by him. She sent her companion to him and
<>informed him of her liking for him. He did not like the
<>idea first, but the clever persuasions of the maid made
<>him agree to a clandestine meeting with the princess at
<>a temple at night that day. Tejasvati1 anxiously waited
<>for the night to come.
<NI>About that time a Rajput prince greatly grieved at the
<>loss of his father and subsequent loss of his kingdom
<>started on a tour to see an old friend of his father. That
<>night, by sheer accident, he came and rested in the
<>same temple where the rendezvous of the princess was
<>fixed. When night fell the princess came to the temple [Page788-a+ 65]
<>and without the least suspicion went and embraced the
<>solitary figure sitting in the temple. The prince did
<>not show any surprise and responded fully. The prin-
<>cess then understood all details of her lover and
<>took him to his father the next morning. Somadatta
<>(that was the prince's name) then told Vikramasena all
<>his mishaps and Vikramasena got back all the lost king-
<>dom of Somadatta and also gave his daughter in mar-
<>riage to him. (Taran3ga 4, Madana Man5cuka1lambaka,
<>Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>TEJASVATI1 II. The queen of A1dityasena a king of
<>Ujjayini1.
<HI>TEJASVI1. One of the five Indras. (See under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<HI>TEJEYU. A prince born to Mis4rakes4i1 of Raudra1s4va, son
<>of Pu1ru. (S4loka 11, Chapter 94, A1di Parva).
<HI>TEJOVATI1. The capital city of Agni. This is situated on
<>the south-east corner of Maha1meru. In the centre is
<>Manovati1, capital city of Brahma1. To the east of it is
<>Amara1vati1, capital city of Indra. In the south-east
<>corner is Tejovati1. In the south is Sam3yamani1, city of
<>Yama. In the south-west is Kr2s2n2a1n5jani1 of Nirr2ti. In
<>the west is S4raddha1vati1 of Varun2a. In the north west
<>is Gandhavati1 of Va1yu. In the north is Mahodaya1 of
<>Kubera. In the north east corner is Yas4ovati1 of I1s4a1na.
<>(8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>THA ({#Ta#}) This letter means taking food. (Chapter 348,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>T2HA ({#Wa#}) This letter means Candraman2d2ala (moon-disc),
<>emptiness and S4iva. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 348).
<HI>T2HIN2T2HA1KARA1LA. A prodigal person who lived in
<>Ujjayini1. He used to defeat all in the game of dice.
<>With the money so received from defeated persons he
<>would buy wheat and go to the burial ground and after
<>making bread with it would eat it dipped in ghee sitting
<>before an oil light placed before an idol of Maha1ka1la
<>(lord of the burial ground). He would then lie there
<>itself and sleep.
<NI>One night he saw the idols in the Maha1ka1la temple twin-
<>kling. He jumped up and challenged the idols for a
<>game of dice. The idols stood mute and T2hin2t2ha1kara1la
<>taking their silence to be consent according to the rules
<>of gambling fixed a wager and played. He won and
<>then he said addressing the idols “I have defeated you.
<>Give me the money due to me.” The idols stood silent
<>and he, therefore, wrestled with them. Still the idols
<>stood dumb. Then T2hin2t2ha1kara1la took his sword.
<>Instantly the devas gave him the money due to him.
<>Early morning he went away from there and spent the
<>money lavishly. At night he came back again and
<>challenged the idols for gambling as before. This be-
<>came a daily routine and the devas felt themselves
<>harassed. They, therefore, approached the goddess
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 and she advised them to refrain from playing
<>as there was no loss of honour if one refused to take a
<>challenge to gamble.
<NI>That night also as usual T2hin2t2ha1kara1la came and chal-
<>lenged the idols for a game of dice. Then the idols said
<>“We are not prepared to play.” Then he challenged
<>Maha1ka1la himself to play. Maha1ka1la also refused to
<>play. Then suddenly the mind of T2hin2t2ha1kara1la
<>changed and he did penance to please Maha1ka1la. Maha1-
<>ka1la was pleased with him, appeared before him and
<>blessed him.
<NI>Once a few nymphs came to bathe in the Maha1ka1li1
<>pond and as per the instructions of Maha1ka1la, T2hin2t2ha1- [Page788-b+ 65]
<>kara1la took away their robes while they were bathing.
<>He demanded a nymph named Kala1vati1 in return for
<>their robes and finding no other way they gave him
<>Kala1vati1.
<NI>Kala1vati1 thus became the wife of a Man due to a curse
<>of Indra. Once she praised sexual enjoyment with men
<>on earth and decried the same with Devas. Indra heard
<>it and he cursed her “Then let her become the wife of a
<>man on earth and enjoy the pleasures there.” All this
<>story T2hin2t2ha1kara1la learned from Kala1vati1. She added
<>she wanted to go to Devaloka the next day for a dance
<>with Rambha1. T2hin2t2ha1kara1la consented and he also went
<>to Devaloka and saw the dance, sitting along with the
<>Devas.
<NI>When Rambha1's dance was over, there was the dance
<>of a goat. Seeing that T2hin2t2ha1kara1la said to himself:
<>“Why, this is a goat I used to see daily in Ujjayini1. How
<>did it come here to dance?” When the dances were over
<>and the people dispersed, Kala1vati1 took T2hin2t2ha1kara1la
<>to the Maha1ka1li1 temple. Next day he met the same
<>goat in Ujjayini1 and then he enquired “Hi, do that
<>dance which you did yesterday before Indra in devaloka.
<>Let me see” The goat stood dumb thinking of how
<>this man on earth came to know of the dances in Deva-
<>loka. T2hin2t2ha1kara1la once again compelled the goat to
<>show its dance but when the goat still refused to dance,
<>he thrashed it with a stick on its head and the goat
<>immediately went to Devaloka and informed Indra
<>about the incident. Indra felt sad when he saw blood
<>oozing from the wound on its head. Indra by his divine
<>powers then understood that Kala1vati1 was at the bottom
<>of all this trouble and cursed her to remain as a doll
<>on a pillar in the temple belonging to King Narasim3ha
<>of Na1gapura. Alambus2a1, mother of Kala1vati1, who heard
<>the curse begged for relief and Indra said she would get
<>freed from the curse when the king himself demolished
<>the temple and razed the place to the ground.
<NI>True to the curse, Kala1vati1 after giving all her orna-
<>ments to T2hin2t2ha1kara1la bid him good bye and went
<>and remained as a doll on the temple-pillar at Na1ga-
<>pura. Deeply distressed at this mishap of his wife,
<>T2hin2t2ha1kara1la dressed himself as an ascetic and went to
<>Na1gapura. There he purchased five earthen pots and
<>filled them with the ornaments of Kala1vati1. He buried
<>four of the pots in the forests and the fifth in the bazaar
<>near the temple. Then he built a hermitage on the
<>shores of a near-by river and started living there. News
<>soon spread that a great yogi1 had come to the city and
<>the King went to see him. They talked for a while on
<>religious and spiritual matters and the King was about
<>to leave when they heard the howl of a jackal. The
<>yogi1 smiled and the King asked him why he smiled.
<>He refused to answer but the King insisted and then
<>the yogi1 said “Oh King, the jackal says that in a forest
<>to the east of the city under a silver plant is a treasure.”
<>The King immediately ordered his men to go and dig
<>at the place and when they did they got the treasure.
<>The King offered the treasure to the yogi1 but he
<>refused to accept it. T2hin2t2ha1kara1la then on three
<>different occasions pointed out to the King the three
<>other pots in the forests and the King got great confi-
<>dence in the powers of the yogi1. One day he went to
<>the temple with the King and while they were walking
<>around a crow crow and the yogi1 smiled. The King
<>again asked him the reason and the yogi1 said that [Page789-a+ 65]
<>there was a treasure pot in the bazaar near-by. When
<>they searched at the spot directed by the yogi1 the
<>treasure was found.
<NI>On another day the King and the yogi1 went to the
<>temple and as they walked about they saw the doll on
<>one of the pillars crying. The King asked the yogi1 the
<>reason for the doll crying thus. The yogi1 replied
<>“Oh, King this temple is not located in a proper place.
<>Further the deity here was not installed at an auspi-
<>cious time. If this continues the King will come to
<>ruin. That was why the doll cried.” On hearing this
<>the King ordered the temple to be completely demo-
<>lished and the place made a plain ground. The order
<>was carried out and Kala1vati1 got release from the
<>curse. She went to heaven and told Indra all that had
<>happened. Indra immediately sent Kala1vati1 to fetch
<>T2hin2t2ha1kara1la to heaven and then both of them lived
<>happily in heaven. (Taran3ga 2, Vis2amas4i1lalambaka,
<>Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>TILABHA1RA. A place situated in the north-east part of
<>Bha1rata. (S4loka 53, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>TILOTTAMA1. A prominent celestial maiden.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Tilottama1 was born to Pradha1, wife of
<>Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of Mari1ci.
<>Alambus2a1, Mis4rakes4i1, Vidyutparn2a1, Arun2a1, Raks2ita1,
<>Rambha1, Manorama1, Suba1hu, Kes4ini1, Surata1, Suraja1
<>and Supriya1 were all sisters of Tilottama1. (Chapter 65,
<>A1di Parva).
<NI>There is a story about the birth of Tilottama1. Two
<>demons named Sunda and Upasunda obtained invinci-
<>ble powers by doing penance. To make these two
<>brothers quarrel with each other, by directions from
<>Brahma1, Vis4vakarma1 created Tilottama1. Vis4vakarma1
<>collected from all inanimate and animate objects parts
<>of objects beautiful to look at and created the enchant-
<>ing Tilottama1. Tilottama1 was then made to come to
<>the world through the womb of Kas4yapa's wife. Be-
<>cause she was made by the tila1m3s4a (small particle) of
<>all the best (uttama) articles of the world she got the
<>name of Tilottama1. (Chapter 215, A1di Parva).
<NI>The good girl named Tilottama1 was formerly created
<>by Brahma1 from small particles of diamonds. (S4loka 1,
<>Chapter 141, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>2) {%How S4iva got four heads and Indra a thousand eyes.%}
<>When the two demon brothers Sundopasundas were
<>creating great havoc in the world by their cruel and
<>immoral deeds, it was Tilottama1 who was deputed by
<>Brahma1 to create a split between the brothers. On the
<>eve of her departure to the world she went to Deva-
<>loka to bid adieu. Brahma1 stood facing south and
<>S4iva stood facing north and Tilottama1 stood in the
<>centre surrounded by the Devas. Tilottama1 circled
<>round the devas worshipping them. S4iva was enamour-
<>ed of her beauty and wanted to see her always and so
<>a face on all the four sides of his head sprang up so
<>that he could see her always as she circled round him.
<>Indra was also enamoured of her and he found his two
<>eyes insufficient to enjoy her beauty. So instantly a
<>thousand eyes sprang up in the face of Indra. (Chapter
<>215, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%How Tilottama1 cursed Sahasra1ni1ka.%} (See under
<>Sahasra1ni1ka).
<NI>4) {%Tilottama1 and Sundopasundas.%} See under Sunda.
<NI>5) {%Other details.%}
<NI>Tilottama1 partook in the Janmotsava (birthday [Page789-b+ 64]
<>festival) of Arjuna. (S4loka 62, Chapter 122, Maha1-
<>bha1rata).
<HI>TIMIDHVAJA. A demon who was ruling in the state
<>of Vaijayantapura. He was called S4ambara also. This
<>demon once attacked Devaloka. Indra was not able
<>to kill him. So he sought the help of Dasaratha.
<>Das4aratha went and fought against the demons.
<>Das4aratha was made to faint in the battlefield by the
<>magic of Timidhvaja and Kaikeyi1 who was there then,
<>took him away and gave him all first aid. Pleased at
<>this Das4aratha promised two boons for her and it was
<>these boons that Kaikeyi1 demanded of Das4aratha on
<>the advice of Manthara1 at the time of the coronation
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma. (Sarga 9, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>TIMIN3GILA. A King. Sahadeva defeated this King
<>during his victory campaign in the south. (S4loka 69,
<>Chapter 31, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>TI1RAGRAHA. An ancient place situated on the north-
<>east part of Bha1rata. (S4loka 52, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>TIRAYA1T2T2AM. A form of unrefined drama current in
<>Kerala. This ancient art originally came into being to
<>propitiate some gods. There are others of this kind like
<>‘Mutiyet2t2u’ ‘Ti1ya1t2t2u’ and ‘Ayyappan Pa1t2t2u’ which all
<>belong to a class of Ritualistic plays.
<NI>This folk drama is a colourful pageant devoted to
<>gods. Its artistic value is worth noticing. This is known
<>by different names like ‘Tira’, ‘Teyya’ and ‘Kaliya1t2t2am’.
<>‘Tira’ in ancient language means ‘daivadars4ana’ (sight
<>of gods) ‘Teyya’ is the corrupt form of ‘daiva’. Tiraya1-
<>t2t2am is a visible amusement where actors appear dressed
<>as gods. Because the actors dance in the dresses of gods,
<>this is called deva1t2t2am also. Teyya1t2t2am is the distorted
<>form of deva1t2t2am. Because this is both a Kali (play) and
<>an a1t2t2am (dance) this is called Kaliya1t2t2am also.
<NI>This is held in different parts of Malabar during the
<>period of January to April. It is a programme of three
<>days. The first programme is to exhibit an A1la1kolam.
<>This is done on the night of the first day. The second
<>programme is to exhibit the vella1t2t2ukolam which will be
<>done on the second day evening. An indication of this
<>is given on the first night itself. The programme of the
<>second day begins with a dance called Velakkali. On
<>that day there will be worshipping of gods at intervals.
<>The Vella1t2t2ukolam begins by five in the evening. The
<>chief actor will present himself before the public in the
<>colourful robes of a god and will begin to dance to the
<>accompaniment of drums and music. As the dance and
<>music continues even those without dresses would start
<>dancing. Gradually sounds of pop-guns and instru-
<>mental music will rend the air. The chief dancer after
<>dancing for some-time would place a stool before the
<>temple and spread a white cloth on it. Then the dancer
<>would sit in meditation and do the ceremony called
<>‘calling the gods’. He would then pray to the gods to
<>bless the function and appear at the zodiacal sign of
<>Virgin. The dance and music start again. Then the
<>people assembled would throw rice and flower into the
<>cloth on the stool. The dancer-god holds a weapon in
<>his hand and changes it often making huge uproars.
<>Then after finishing the ceremonies like Ka1vu1t2t2u and
<>Arulappa1t2u, the Vella1t2t2akka1ran retires. Then another
<>actor in the dress of another god appears as Vella1t2t2ak- [Page790-a+ 64]
<>ka1ran and repeats the programme of his predecessor.
<>Because the dance (a1t2t2am) is done before a white (vella)
<>cloth the dance is called Vella1t2t2am.
<NI>After the vella1t2t2am before midnight Tiraya1t2t2am begins.
<>The dresses of the teyyas differ slightly from each other.
<>Some Tiras wear jackets and skirts while some wear
<>flower garlands made of Tulasi1 leaves (basil plant) and
<>cet2t2i (jungle geranium). All the tiras rush to the temple
<>in great spirit and they are followed by lamp-holders
<>and torch-bearers to the accompaniment of loud sounds
<>of musical instruments and uproars from the spectators.
<>When the first round of dances is over, the ‘Teyya’
<>stands dancing, pouring blessings to the people and
<>deciding ways of atonement for the sins done. Then
<>food is offered to the gods and the function ends with
<>a ‘Vela’ circling the temple.
<HI>TIRUJN5A1NASAMBANDHA (R). He was one of the
<>four Da1ks2in2a1tya S4aivamata1ca1ryas. He lived during the
<>early part of the seventh century. The book on Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tya S4aivamata is called Tirumura. There are twelve
<>songs in that book. They were compiled by Nambi-
<>ya1n2d2a1r Nambi who lived during the period of Ra1jara1ja
<>Cola. The first seven of these are devotional songs
<>called Teva1ras. They were composed jointly by Tiru-
<>jn5a1nasambandhar, Tiruna1vukkaras4ar and Sundaramu1rti.
<>The first three teva1ras are of Tirujn5a1nasambandhar.
<>The twelfth tirumura is called Periyapura1n2a. Its author
<>was S4ekkizha1r. He was called Arulmozhitteva also. He
<>was the chief minister of Anapa1yacola who ruled during
<>the period 1063 to 1112 A.D. The theme of Periya-
<>pura1n2a is the life history of sixtythree S4aivasiddhas who
<>were renowned as Na1yana1rs and At2iya1rs. It is in the
<>sixth chapter of the second part of this book that they
<>discuss Tirujn5a1nasambandhar.
<NI>He was born in the village of S4i1rka1zhi (Brahmapura)
<>near Kumbhakon2am in the district of Tan5ja1vu1r. His
<>father was S4ivapa1dara1ya and mother Bhagavatiya1r.
<>Once when S4ivapa1dara1ya went to bathe in the temple
<>tank called Brahmati1rtha he took along with him his
<>son Sambandhar also. Keeping his son on the steps of
<>the tank S4ivapa1dara1ya plunged himself into the waters.
<>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 who came that way saw the child
<>sitting alone and Pa1rvati1 went and fed him with her
<>breast-milk. From that moment onwards the child
<>started singing songs in praise of S4iva and Pa1rvati1.
<>When he grew up, he did many wonderful deeds visiting
<>many S4iva temples of Pa1n2d2ira1jya. His father fixed up
<>a marriage for him and the bride's party assembled
<>even before time at the Cidambara temple. Tirujn5a1-
<>nasambandhar came there in time and standing before
<>the temple deity sang a song in praise of S4iva. The song
<>was greatly appealing and at the end of the song before
<>all those assembled there Sambandhar to the astonish-
<>ment of all merged with the deity.

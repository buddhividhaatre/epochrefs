<HI>PAN2D2ITAKA. One of the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>He was killed in the great battle by Bhi1masena.
<>(Chapter 88, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PA1N2D2U I. Father of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Refer to the genealogy of Arjuna.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4antanu, a King of Candravam3s4a, had two
<>wives, Gan3ga1 and Satyavati1. Even while Satyavati1 was
<>a maiden she got of the sage Para1s4ara a son named
<>Vya1sa. But because of the blessing of the sage Satya-
<>vati1 did not lose her maidenhood. She got of S4antanu
<>two sons, Citra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya. Citra1n3gada
<>died young. Vicitravi1rya married the two daughters,
<>Ambika1 and Amba1lika1, of the King of Ka1s4i1. Vicitra-
<>vi1rya died before any progeny was born to him. To
<>save the dynasty from extinction Satyavati1 asked her
<>first son Vya1sa to beget children of Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1. Accordingly Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born to
<>Ambika1 of Vya1sa and Pa1n2d2u to Amba1lika1. (Chapters
<>63 and 105, A1di Parva)
<NI>3) {%How Pa1n2d2u got his name.%} Vya1sa came to Hastina1-
<>pura by the command of his mother to beget sons of
<>Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. Vya1sa was an ugly sage with
<>matted hair and he was dressed in garments of
<>deerskin. Satyavati1 that night called Ambika1 to her
<>side and in secret commanded her to go and lie with
<>Vya1sa. She was reluctant to have a sexual union with
<>that old and ugly sage. Yet obeying the orders of her
<>mother-in-law she did so shutting her eyes during the
<>whole period. The result was she got a child born
<>blind who became known later as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. The
<>next day Satyavati1 ordered Amba1lika1 to go and lie
<>with Vya1sa. Amba1lika1 on entering the bed chamber
<>went pale on seeing the ugly Vya1sa and the result was
<>she got a child that was pale white in colour. That
<>child became known as Pa1n2d2u. The third day Satya-
<>vati1 asked her servant-maid to go and lie with Vya1sa.
<>She did it with pleasure and she remained happy and
<>cheerful during the whole period. The result was she got
<>a beautiful child who became an intelligent scholar of
<>great wisdom. He was known later as Vidura. (Chap-
<>ters 1, 63, and 105, A1di Parva).
<NI>4) {%Boyhood and kingship.%} Bhi1s2ma took care of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura as his own sons. Bhi1s2ma
<>taught them all the Vedas including Dhanurveda, and [Page564-b+ 65]
<>all warfare like mace-fight. They were trained in the
<>use of elephants also. Bhi1s2ma taught them law and
<>acquainted them with all the Itiha1sas and Pura1n2as.
<>Pa1n2d2u became second to none in archery. The people
<>were all happy. When the boyhood was over Pa1n2d2u
<>was crowned as Yuvara1ja. Pa1n2d2u was the most eligible
<>of the three to become King, for Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was a
<>born blind man and Vidura was the son of a servant-
<>maid. (Chapter 109, A1di Parva).
<NI>5) {%Married life.%} Obeying the behest of Bhi1s2ma, Pa1n2d2u
<>married Pr2tha1, daughter of the Ya1dava King S4u1rasena.
<>She was the sister of Vasudeva, father of Kr2s2n2a. She
<>got the name Kunti1 because she grew up in the palace
<>of King Kuntibhoja. While Kunti1 was staying in the
<>palace of Kuntibhoja Durva1sas came and stayed in the
<>the palace as a guest of the King. Kunti1 then served
<>the sage with such devotion and patience that Durva1-
<>sas at the time of his departure gave Kunti1 a divine
<>mantra for begetting children. The mantra was to be
<>used only five times. If she called upon any god
<>repeating that mantra, that god would manifest himself
<>before her and bless her with a son equal to him in
<>glory. Out of impatient curiosity of youth Kunti1 tried
<>it before getting married. One morning, seeing the
<>beautiful and brilliant sun in the sky she invoked him
<>by the mantra and instantly the Sun stood in all
<>bewitching brilliance before her and she got of him a
<>son who was known as Karn2a later. Unmarried as she
<>was, Kunti1 sent the child afloat in the river nearby.
<NI>Even after a child-birth Kunti1 remained a virgin by
<>the blessing of the Sun and so got married as a virgin.
<>Many Kings were present for the Svayam3vara of
<>Kunti1 and she put the wedding garland round the neck
<>of Pa1n2d2u.
<NI>Once Bhi1s2ma went to the country of Madra. The King
<>of Madra received Bhi1s2ma with respect and Bhi1s2ma
<>took Ma1dri1 daughter of Madra as a bride for Pa1n2d2u.
<>He brought her to Hastina1pura and married her to
<>Pa1n2d2u. Pa1n2d2u lived with his two wives happily and
<>ruled the country well. Once Pa1n2d2u attacked Das4a1rn2a
<>with a huge army and defeated him. Later he defeated
<>Di1rgha, King of Magadha. Then he conducted a
<>victory march capturing many kingdoms like Ka1s4i1,
<>Mithila1, Suhma and Pun2d2ra. Thus many of the Kings
<>of Uttara Bha1rata became feudatory princes of Pa1n2d2u.
<>In consultation with his brother Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u
<>gave all the wealth he got by his might to Satyavati1
<>and Bhi1s2ma. He gave enough riches to Vidura also.
<>Then Pa1n2d2u went and stayed with his wives in a
<>forest to the south of the Hima1layas. (Chapters 110 to
<>114, A1di Parva).
<NI>6) {%Curse of a sage.%} While Pa1n2d2u was once walking
<>with his wives in the forest he saw a couple of deer
<>playfully running about and the hunting nature in
<>him made him send an arrow against one of them. The
<>deer was none other than the sage Kindama who in
<>the guise of a deer was having sport with his mate.
<>While falling dead Kindama cursed Pa1n2d2u thus “Oh
<>wretched King, you will fall dead the moment you
<>touch your wife in amorous sport.” From that day
<>onwards Pa1n2d2u could not touch his wives. (For details
<>see under Kindama).
<NI>7) {%Sannya1sa and death.%} With the death of the innocent
<>sage Kindama there occurred a great change in the
<>life of Pa1n2d2u. At first he thought of committing suicide. [Page565-a+ 64]
<>But he changed that decision and started for the
<>Hima1layas to perform penance there. Kunti1 and
<>Ma1dri1 accompanied him. They gave away all their
<>jewels and ornaments as gifts to brahmins. People
<>followed them to the border of the forests and returned
<>to the country weeping. Pa1n2d2u and his wives visited
<>such holy places as Na1gas4ata1dri, Caitraratha, Ka1laku1t2a,
<>Hima1layas, Gandhama1dana and the lake Indradyumna.
<>Then they went to S4atas4r2n3ga and started performing
<>penance. Once Pa1n2d2u and wives along with a few
<>sages went to Brahmaloka to attend a Ya1ga there. The
<>long travel toiled them much and on the way Pa1n2d2u
<>wept thinking of his pitiable state of having no issue.
<>Then Pa1n2d2u told them of his helplessness in the matter
<>because of the curse of the sage Kindama hanging over
<>him. Then Kunti1 confided in him the secret of the
<>divine mantras in her possession. Pa1n2d2u was extremely
<>pleased and with his permission Kunti1 got three sons,
<>Yudhis2t2hira, Bhi1masena and Arjuna. She gave one
<>chance to Ma1dri1 and she got two sons out of it named
<>Nakula and Sahadeva.
<NI>Pa1n2d2u was living happily with his children in S4atas4r2n3ga
<>when spring time arrived in the forest with all its
<>blossoming brilliance and fragrance conducive to
<>amorous thoughts in all living beings. Pa1n2d2u one day
<>walked alone with Ma1dri1 enjoying the sight of the
<>flowering plants and trees. Bees and Beetles hummed
<>around the flowers and on the branches sat the Cuckoos
<>singing. There was a seductive fragrance all around and
<>Pa1n2d2u was excited beyond controllable limits. Pa1n2d2u's
<>resolution broke down under the exhilarating influence
<>of the season and despite repeated protests from Ma1dri1,
<>Pa1n2d2u caught hold of her and embraced her. The
<>curse of the sage took effect instantaneously and
<>Pa1n2d2u fell down dead.
<NI>The inhabitants of S4atas4r2n2ga assembled there weeping.
<>In the presence of a huge crowd including the relatives
<>who had come down from Hastina1pura the dead body
<>of Pa1n2d2u was cremated according to religious rites.
<>Both the wives came forward to end their lives in the
<>funeral pyre of Pa1n2d2u. But Kunti1 was asked to remain
<>to take care of the children and Ma1dri1 leaving her
<>children to the care of Kunti1 jumped into the funeral
<>pyre and ended her life. It was the sage Kas4yapa who
<>performed the funeral rites of Pa1nd2d2u. (Chapters 115 to
<>126, A1di Parva).
<NI>8) {%After the demise.%} Pa1n2d2u's soul is shining in the
<>court of Yama. (S4loka 25, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<>Pa1n2d2u sent a message to Yudhis2t2hira from Devaloka
<>that Yudhis2t2hira should conduct a Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a.
<>The message was carried by Na1rada. (S4loka 24,

<HI>PA1N2D2YA. I. A King of Vidarbha who was a great devotee
<>of S4iva. One day while he was performing S4ivapu1ja1 at
<>dusk he heard a loud noise outside the city and before
<>completing the worship he went out and faced the
<>enemies who were attempting to enter the city and
<>killed its leader. He returned after the fight and
<>without completing the worship took his meals. It was
<>a sin to do so and the King was therefore born in his
<>next birth as Satyaratha, a King, and was killed by
<>his enemies. (S4atarudrasam3hita1, S4iva Pura1n2a).
<HI>PA1N2D2YA. II. (A Tamilian dynasty of Kings.) A place of
<>Pura1n2ic fame in Daks2in2a Bha1rata. The three states
<>Cera, Cola and Pa1n2d2ya were from early times renown-
<>ed states of Daks2in2a Bha1rata. Historically and Puran2ic-
<>ally Pa1n2d2ya was a state of eminence.
<NI>(A.) {%Historically.%} The Pa1n2d2ya dynasty of Kings is
<>very ancient, The exact period of its beginning is still
<>unknown. Megasthanes who lived in the fourth century
<>B.C. has made mention of the Pa1n2d2ya dynasty in his
<>diary. Julian, an emperor of Italy, who lived in 361
<>A.D. is stated to have received visitors from Pa1n2d2ya-
<>des4a. The Pa1n2d2ya dynasty was revived and elevated
<>under the leadership of Katun3ka in the 7th century A.D.
<>From that time till the 16th century Madura was the
<>capital of Pa1n2d2yades4a. The Ucca1n3gi1 dynasty which was
<>ruling the places to the south of Tun3gabhadra1 during
<>the period from 9th century to 13th century A.D. is
<>believed to be a part of the Pa1n2d2yavam3s4a which had
<>gone from Madura. A continuous history of the Pa1n2d2ya
<>line of Kings is not available. Many Kings bear names
<>like Ja1tavarma1 or Ma1ravarma1. The Pa1n2d2ya Kings
<>were devotees of S4iva even from the period of the
<>Jainas. At times they have ruled over the combined
<>kingdoms of Cera and Cola. During the period from
<>the 12th to the 14th century A.D. Pa1n2d2ya was ruled by
<>five of the most valiant rulers and at that time the
<>Pa1n2d2yades4a included all the places in south India up
<>to Nellore. But the power of the Pa1n2d2yas waned when
<>the power of the Sultans who ruled Delhi spread to the
<>south. After 1370 A.D only on rare occasions has the
<>power of the Pa1n2d2yas spread to the north of river
<>Ka1veri1. In 1312 A.D. Kerala got herself free from the
<>hold of the Tamilian Kings. (Pa1n2d2yara1jya).

<>(i) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once slew a Pa1n2d2ya King who was the
<>father of Malayadhvaja. Malayadhvaja who was a very
<>valiant archer started for Dva1raka1 to kill Kr2s2n2a to
<>avenge the death of his father. Friends dissuaded him
<>from his attempt and so he dropped the idea. During
<>the time of Maha1bha1rata Malayadhvaja was the King
<>of Pa1n2d2ya. (Chapter 23, Dron2a Parva).

<HI>PA1N2INI. The author of the Sanskrit Grammar, Pa1n2i-
<>ni1ya.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} There is nowhere else in this
<>world a grammar so scientific and so complete as
<>Pa1n2ini1ya. The book contains about four thousand
<>aphorisms. Pa1n2ini was an inspired sage and he got his
<>knowledge from S4iva. It has not been possible to gather
<>much information about the life of such a celebrated
<>grammarian. Patan5jali believes that he was the son of
<>Da1ks2i. He addresses Pa1n2ini as Aca1rya, Bhagava1n and
<>Mahars2i. The Chinese traveller Huen Tsang says that
<>the grammar of all the languages in this world has its
<>origin from Pa1n2ini1ya. Ra1mabhadradi1ks2ita says that
<>Pa1n2ini was the son of the sage Pa1n2i.
<NI>2) {%Life period.%} There is difference of opinion regarding
<>the period during which Pa1n2ini lived. Dr. Goldstucker and
<>Bhandarkar believe that Pa1n2ini lived before 500 B.C.
<>while Vincent Smith and Belvelkar fix the period in
<>700 B.C. Patan5jali, the author of the celebrated
<>‘Maha1bha1s2ya’ (commentary on Pa1n2ini1ya) lived in
<>200 B.C. Patan5jali has contradicted many of the un-
<>just criticisms made by Ka1tya1yana about Pa1n2ini1ya. So
<>Pa1n2ini must have lived before Ka1tya1yana. Pa1n2ini has
<>made no reference to Buddha and so he must have
<>lived before Buddha. Pa1n2ini has shown great grasp
<>over the laws of Smr2ti and so he must have lived after
<>Manu. Considering all these facts together it will be
<>proper to fix the period of the end of the sixth century
<>or the beginning of the seventh century B.C.
<NI>3) {%Place of birth.%} Evidences are lacking to correctly
<>fix the birth-place of Pa1n2ini. Many pandits believe
<>that Pa1n2ini was born in the village of S4a1la1tura in the
<>city of Attock in the state of Ga1ndha1ra. But Pa1n2ini has
<>spent the major portion of his life in Pa1t2ali1putra. So
<>some pandits are of opinion that only the ancestors
<>of Pa1n2ini belonged to the village of S4a1la1tura and
<>Pa1n2ini was born and brought up in Pa1t2ali1putra.
<>Jaimini and Bhartr2hari have stated that Pa1n2ini was a
<>S4is2t2a. S4is2t2as were brahmins well-versed in the S4a1stras
<>and devoid of earthly pleasures who inhabited the area
<>surrounded by the Hima1layas in the north, Ka1lakavana
<>(Bengal) in the east, Vindhya mountains in the south
<>and the A1dars4a (Aravalli mountains) in the west.
<NI>4) {%A legend.%} There was a preceptor named Vars2a in
<>Pa1t2ali1putra and Pa1n2ini had his education under him.
<>Vars2a gradually acquired a large number of disciples
<>and Pa1n2ini was the most dull-witted among them. But
<>he was greatly devoted to his Guru and this pleased [Page566-b+ 64]
<>the wife of the Guru and she took great interest in
<>Pa1n2ini. One day she called Pa1n2ini to her side and
<>advised him to go to the Hima1layas and do penance
<>to propitiate S4iva to get knowledge from him. Pa1n2ini
<>obeying instructions went and performed penance.
<>S4iva was pleased and he granted him knowledge about
<>a new grammar. By the time Pa1n2ini came back from
<>the Hima1layas with his grammar another disciple of
<>Vars2a, Vararuci by name, had come down with a
<>grammar from Indra. Pa1n2ini challenged Vararuci for a
<>polemical contest. It took eight days and on the eighth
<>day Vararuci defeated Pa1n2ini. At once there was a
<>great humming sound from the sky and the grammar
<>book of Vararuci was destroyed. After that Pa1n2ini
<>defeated all his co-disciples in polemics and emerged
<>as the greatest grammarian of the world. (Katha1pi1t2ha-
<>lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara, Taran3ga 4).
<NI>5) {%The birth of Pa1n2ini1ya.%} When Pa1n2ini was doing
<>penance to propitiate S4iva the latter appeared before
<>him and started dancing. He sounded his musical
<>instrument d2hakka1 (a large double drum) fourteen
<>times. Each of it produced a different sound as follows
<>(1) Aiun2 (2) R2l2k (3) Eon3 (4) Aiauc (5) Hayavarat2
<>(6) lan2 (7) n5aman3an2anam (8) Jhabhan5 (9) Ghad2ha-
<>dhas2 (10) Jabagad2adas4 (11) Khaphachat2hathacat2atav
<>(12) Kapay (13) S4as2asar (14) Hal. Pa1n2ini accepted
<>these fourteen sounds as fourteen su1tras (aphorisms).
<>They are called Pratya1ha1rasu1tras. (The comprehension
<>of several letters or affixes into one syllable effected
<>by combining the first letter of a Su1tra with its final
<>indicatory letter.). These Su1tras are now known as
<>Ma1hes4varasu1tras.
<NI>Pa1n2ini's grammar contains eight chapters and each
<>chapter has got four pa1das and each pa1da contains
<>many su1tras. He has taken examples from worldly
<>and spiritual texts in literature. He has dealt with the
<>origin of sounds, connection between two words and
<>all such etymological details. Pa1n2ini's grammar is not a
<>mere grammar book. It is a science of language in it-
<>self.

<NI>2) {%General characteristics.%} Brahman is such that he who
<>says he knows it does not know it and he who says he
<>does not know it, knows it. It is beyond the experiences
<>of time and space. The chief attributes of Brahman
<>are Sat, Cit and A1nanda. Sat means existence, the
<>really existent truth. The one and undivided existence.
<>There are pandits who say that it was undivided,
<>Na1stitva (nonexistence) that was at the beginning
<>of the Universe. Since nothing can be born from
<>‘nothing’ the world should have started from astitva
<>(existence). There is a saying in R2gveda explaining
<>the position thus:--“There was neither Astitva nor
<>Na1stitva (existence or non-existence) at the beginning.”
<>It is a matter to ponder how strongly conscious was
<>the R2s2i who made the above statement about the
<>Parabrahman's Nirgun2atva (devoid of attributes) and
<>how clearly he tries to make it understandable to
<>those who have not experienced the idea.
<NI>Cit means knowledge, splendour, consciousness. A1nanda
<>means bliss. Paul Deussen writes that the ancient
<>Upanis2ads do not include in the definition of Brahman
<>the term ‘a1nanda’.
<NI>3) {%The two forms of Brahman.%} Brahman has two forms--
<>Parabrahman and Aparabrahman. Parabrahman is
<>Amu1rta (formless, incorporeal) and Aparabrahman is
<>Mu1rta (embodied, corporeal). The Amu1rta Brahman
<>is known by such names as Parabrahman, Parama1tma1
<>and Nirgun2abrahman. The corporeal or material

<HI>PARA1S4ARA I.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u--Brahma1
<>-Vasis2t2ha--S4akti--Para1s4ara.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4akti, son of Vasis2t2ha begot of his wife
<>Adr2s2yanti1 the son named Para1s4ara. Even at the time of
<>his birth he was a scholar. (For details regarding birth
<>see under Adr2s4yant2i1).
<NI>3) {%Ra1ks2asaya1ga.%} Even before the birth of Para1s4ara,
<>Kalma1s2apa1da in his demoniacal form ate his father,
<>S4akti. Therefore Para1s4ara nurtured an obstinate hatred
<>against the Ra1ks2asas. So he performed a Ya1ga to kill
<>all the ra1ks2asas. Thousands of ra1ks2asas were burnt to
<>death at this ya1ga and Vasis2t2ha, grandfather of
<>Para1s4ara felt sorry for the innocent ra1ks2asas. He
<>approached Para1s4ara and said “Son, do not give way
<>to such anger. Abandon this wrath. What harm have
<>these poor ra1ks2asas done? Death was in the destiny of
<>your father. Every one has to suffer the result of his
<>own deeds. Anger destroys the fame and austerity which
<>one has attained by years of toil. Therefore abandon
<>your anger and wind up your Ya1ga.”
<NI>Para1s4ara accepted the abvice of his grandfather.
<>Vasis2t2ha was pleased with his grandson and at that
<>time Pulastyamahars2i son of Brahma1 also came there.
<>Vasis2t2ha gave arghya (water and flowers) and received
<>him. Then Vasis2t2ha and Pulastya jointly blessed him
<>and said he would be the author of Pura1n2asam3hita1.
<>Thus Para1s4ara became the best of the Guruparampara1
<>(traditional line of preceptors). (Chapter 1, Am3s4a 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%Birth of Vya1sa.%} Para1s4ara begot a son of a fisher-
<>woman named Satyavati1 and the boy became later the
<>celebrated Vya1sa.
<NI>5) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) He got the name Para1s4ara because even from the
<>womb of his mother he consoled Vasis2t2ha when his son
<>S4akti, father of Para1s4ara was eaten by the demoniac
<>form of Kalma1s2apa1da.
<NI>(ii) See under Guruparampara1 the status of Para1s4ara in
<>that traditional line of Gurus.
<NI>(iii) Among the Su1ktas, Su1kta 65, Anuva1ka 12, Man2d2ala
<>1 of R2gveda was sung by Para1s4ara.
<NI>(iv) Para1s4ara was one among the several sages who
<>visited Bhi1s2ma lying on his bed of arrows. (Chapter 47,
<>S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(v) Once Para1s4ara visited king Janaka and talked with
<>him on A1dhya1tmika topics (spiritual matters). (Chapter
<>290, S4a1nti Parva). [Page568-b+ 65]
<NI>(vi) Chapter 150 of Anus4a1sana Parva mentions Para1s4ara
<>as describing the power of Sa1vitri1mantra to an
<>audience.
<HI>PARA1S4ARA II. A serpent born of the family of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. This was burnt to death at the sarpasatra
<>of Janamejaya. (S4loka 19, Chapter 57, A1di Parva).
<HI>PA1RA1S4ARYA I. Vya1sa, son of sage Para1s4ara. (See under
<>Vya1sa).
<HI>PA1RA1S4ARYA II. This sage is different from Vya1sa. This
<>Pa1ra1s4arya was a member of the court of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4loka 13, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva). He was a member
<>of the court of Indra also. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once met him while
<>he was going to Hastina1pura from Dva1raka1. (S4loka 64,
<>Chapter 83, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>PA1RAS4AVA. A child born to a brahmin of a s4u1dra wo-
<>man. Vidura was a son born to Vya1sa of a s4u1dra wo-
<>man and was therefore called Pa1ras4ava. (S4loka 25,
<>Chapter 101, A1di Parva).
<HI>PA1RASIKA. A place of human habitation in ancient
<>Bha1rata. (S4loka 25, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PARAS4URA1MA. An incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u, as man.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Ma1ha1vis2n2u--
<>Brahma1-Bhr2gu-Cyavana-U1rva-R2ci1ka-Jamadagni-
<>Paras4ura1ma.
<NI>2) {%Cause for incarnation.%} Once god Agni went to Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna and begged for food. The king allowed him
<>to take from his vast territory as much food as he wanted
<>from anywhere he liked. Agni started burning forests
<>and mountains and consuming them. Deep inside. one
<>of the forests a sage named A1pava was performing
<>penance and the fire burnt the a1s4rama of A1pava also.
<>Enraged at this the sage cursed thus: “Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>is at the root of this havoc. The arrogance of Ks2atriyas
<>has increased beyond limits. Maha1vis2n2u would there-
<>fore be born on earth as Paras4ura1ma to destroy this
<>arrogance of the Ks2atriyas.” Accordingly Ma1ha1vis2n2u
<>was born as Paras4ura1ma in the Bha1rgava race. (Chap-
<>ter 40, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a gives another version: Vis2n2u pro-
<>mised Bhu1midevi1 (mother earth) that he would be born
<>on earth as Paras4ura1ma when Bhu1midevi1 went to him in
<>the form of a cow and complained to him about the
<>atrocities of the wicked Ks2atriya kings.
<NI>3) {%Birth.%} Paras4ura1ma was born as the son of sage
<>Jamadagni of his wife Ren2uka1. Their a1s4rama was on
<>the shores of the Narmada1 river. Ren2uka1, mother of
<>Paras4ura1ma, was the daughter of King Prasenajit. She
<>had four sons even before the birth of Paras4ura1ma
<>(Chapter 58, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Paras4ura1ma spent his boyhood
<>with his parents in the a1s4rama. An important event
<>in his life then was his slaying his mother at the behest
<>of his father. (See under Jamadagni, Para 6). Though
<>Paras4ura1ma was a brahmin there is nothing on record
<>to show that he did study the Vedas. Perhaps he might
<>have had the Vedic instructions from his father during
<>his life with him. He had even from the beginning
<>shown an interest in learning Dhanurvidya1 (archery).
<>For obtaining proficiency in archery he went to the
<>Hima1layas and did penance to please S4iva for many
<>years. Pleased at his penance S4iva on several occasions
<>extolled the virtues of Paras4ura1ma. At that time the
<>asuras (demons) acquired strength and attacked the
<>devas. The devas complained to S4iva. S4iva called
<>Paras4ura1ma and asked him to fight with and defeat [Page569-a+ 64]
<>the semdon. Paras4ura1ma was without weapons and he
<>asked S4iva how he could go and fight the demons
<>without weapons. S4iva said: “Go with my blessings
<>end you will kill your foes.” Para ura1ma did not wait
<>for a moment. When S4iva thus assured him of success,
<>on he went straight to fight with the demons. He
<>defeated the asuras and came back to S4iva when the
<>latter gave him many boons and divine weapons.
<NI>Till that time his name was only Ra1ma and he became
<>Paras4ura1ma because among the weapons given to him
<>by S4iva was a weapon named Paras4u (axe). There is a
<>story behind this weapon Paras4u. Once S4iva was not
<>invited for a Ya1ga conducted by Daks2a. An angered
<>S4iva threw his spike into the Ya1gas4a1la1 (sacrifical hall).
<>The spike spoiled the Ya1ga and smashed the hall and
<>after that roamed about aimlessly for sometime and
<>then turned towards Badarya1s4rama where at that time
<>Narana1ra1yan2as were engaged in penance. The spike
<>went straight to the heart of sage Na1ra1yan2a. Na1ra1yan2a
<>made the defiant sound ‘hum’ (hum3ka1ra) and the spike
<>turned away. S4iva felt angry for thus showing disres-
<>pect to his spike and he attacked the sage. At once
<>Narars2i plucked a grass and reciting a mantra threw it
<>at S4iva. The grass became a Paras4u (axe) and it
<>attacked S4iva. S4iva broke it into two. Then Nara-
<>Na1ra1yan2as bowed before him and worshipped him. There-
<>after the two pieces of the Paras4u remained with S4iva.
<>It was one of these that S4iva gave to Paras4ura1ma.
<>When Paras4ura1ma was returning happy and glorious
<>with boons and weapons he got on his way a disciple
<>named Akr2tavran2a. (See under Akr2tavran2a). Guru and
<>disciple lived in an a1s4rama and Paras4ura1ma became a
<>noted Guru in dhanurveda (archery). (Chapter 34,
<>Karn2a Parva; Chapter 49, S4a1nti Parva and Chapter 18,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>5) {%Instruction in archery.%} According to Pura1n2as Paras4u-
<>ra1ma1 did not spend his life as an instructor in archery.
<>There are statements, however, mentioning that Karn2a
<>and Dron2a took instructions from him.
<NI>Pretending to be a brahmin Karn2a commenced taking
<>instructions in archer2y from Paras4ura1ma. When his
<>education was complete Paras4ura1ma taught him
<>Brahma1stra. One day tired after a long walk in the
<>forests Paras4ura1ma took rest placing his head on the
<>lap of Karn2a and soon fell asleep. At that time a beetle
<>came and started sucking blood from the thigh of
<>Karn2a. Karn2a remained still, bearing the pain, lest
<>any movement of his body should disturb the sleep of
<>his Guru. Blood was oozing from his thinghs and it
<>slowly made the body of the Guru also wet. Paras4ura1ma
<>woke up and the sight of the bleeding thigh and the
<>calm demeanour of Karn2a raised doubts in him. He
<>questioned Karn2a saying that no brahmin could ever
<>bear such a pain with such calmness and Karn2a had to
<>tell the truth. Then Paras4ura1ma cursed him for deceit
<>against his Guru saying that he would never be able
<>to remember the Brahma1stra when the time to use
<>it came.
<NI>There is a story behind Alarka, the beetle that bit
<>Karn2a. This beetle was in his previous birth a demon
<>named Dam3s4a. Dam3s4a once tried to molest the wife of the
<>sage Bhr2gu. The Mahars2i cursed him and made him into
<>a beetle. On his request for mercy he said he would
<>get release from the curse by Paras4ura1ma. So the beetle [Page569-b+ 64]
<>became the Ra1ks2asa again and left the place. Karn2a
<>took leave of Paras4ura1ma and went to Hastina1pura.
<>(S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>Another famous disciple of Paras4ura1ma was Dron2a.
<>There is a story behind Dron2a getting Dhanurveda
<>from Paras4ura1ma. After travelling throughout the world
<>exterminating the Ks2atriya race Paras4ura1ma gave all his
<>wealth to Kas4yapa. On hearing that Paras4ura1ma was
<>giving away all his riches as gifts to brahmins Dron2a
<>rushed to Mahendraparvata to see Paras4ura1ma. By then
<>Paras4ura1ma had distributed all his wealth excepting
<>Dhanurveda. Paras4ura1ma called Dron2a to his side and
<>said that only two things remained with him, his body
<>and Dhanurveda. Dron2a, he added, could take anyone
<>of the two and then Dron2a took Dhanurveda from him.
<>After that Paras4ura1ma went to Maha1ran2ya for the sake
<>of penance. (Chapter 130, A1di Parva).
<NI>There are some apparent inconsistencies in the above
<>stories: It is said Dron2a taught Dhanurveda to Karn2a.
<>Dron2a was the last person to receive Dhanurveda from
<>Paras4ura1ma because the latter, surrendering his Dhanur-
<>veda in entire, left for the forests for doing penance.
<>Then, when did Karn2a learn Dhanurveda from Paras4u-
<>ra1ma? Could it be before Dron2a went to Paras4ura1ma?
<>Then it must be accepted that Dron2a had not studied
<>under Paras4ura1ma when he was teaching the
<>the Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas. He learnt it from some-
<>where before he became the preceptor of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>Karn2a after studying under Dron2a for some time went
<>to Paras4ura1ma for higher studies and Dron2a approached
<>Paras4ura1ma after Karn2a had left him.
<NI>6) {%The destruction of the Ks2atriyas.%} The most important
<>event of his life was the total extermination of the
<>Ks2atriya race. The Pura1n2ic belief is that he went
<>round the world eighteen times to massacre the
<>Ks2atriyas.
<NI>In many places in the Pura1n2as it is stated that Paras4ura1ma
<>fought against the Ks2atriyas eighteen times. But in
<>chapter 29 of As4vamedha Parva it is stated that Paras4u-
<>ra1ma fought against the Ks2atriyas twentyone times
<>So it is to be surmised that Paras4ura1ma fought eighteen
<>big battles and three minor ones.
<NI>There are some old stories to explain this revengeful
<>enmity of Paras4ura1ma towards the Ks2atriyas.
<NI>(1) {%Family enmity.%} The Hehaya dynasty was the most
<>powerful kingly race then. Paras4ura1ma was a descend-
<>ant of Bhr2gu, a brahmin sage. That is why he gets
<>the name Bha1rgava also. The Bha1rgavas were for gene-
<>rations the family preceptors of the Hehaya kings.
<>Taking advantage of their supreme position in the royal
<>palace the Bha1rgavas accumulated great wealth at the
<>cost of the royal riches. Gradually the Bha1rgavas rose
<>in prosperity in inverse proportion to the decline of
<>the Hehaya wealth. It was at the time of R2ci1ka, grand-
<>father of Parasura1ma that they touched the rock-bottom
<>of their wealth and they found funds lacking even for
<>the day to day administration of the state. In despair
<>they went and requested the R2ci1kas to lend them some
<>money. But they hid their money and refused to give
<>them anything. The Ks2atriya kings got angry and
<>killed the brahmins. What stock was left of them went
<>to the base of the Hima1layas. The wife of R2ci1ka who
<>was pregnant then kept the child in her womb for twelve
<>years afraid to bring forth the child. After that the [Page570-a+ 65]
<>child came out breaking open the thigh (u1ru) and
<>so the child was called Aurva. Even at the time of his
<>birth Aurva shone like a brilliant torch and not only
<>that; the child cried aloud “Oh, wicked Ks2atriyas, I
<>will kill every one of you. I heard from my mother's
<>womb the din of the swords you raised to kill my
<>ancestors. I will never wait for another moment to wreak
<>vengeance on you.”
<NI>The fire that emanated from the face of Aurva burnt
<>even Devaloka. Ks2atriyas as a class came and prostrated
<>before him. The devas came and requested him to
<>abandon his anger and Aurva agreed. The devas picked
<>up the fire sparks from Aurva's face and deposited
<>them in the ocean. From those sparks put in the ocean
<>was born Bad2ava1gni alias Aurva.
<NI>(ii) {%Curse of the sage.%} From Aurva was born Jamadagni
<>and from Jamadagni was born Paras4ura1ma. In the
<>race of the Hehayas was born at that time a very valor-
<>ous king named Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. Once Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>gave a dinner to Agnibhagava1n. Agni began to devour all
<>the mountains and forests in the world. The burning was
<>so indiscriminate that it burnt the a1s4rama of a sage
<>named A1pava also. The sage cursed Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna
<>saying that the thousand hands of the latter would be
<>cut off by Pasas4ura1ma born in the family of Bha1rgavas.
<>From that day onwards the latent feud in him against
<>the Bha1rgavas was roused into action.
<NI>(iii) {%Varun2a's ridicule.%} Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna who got a thou-
<>sand hands by a boon from a sage named Datta1treya
<>subdued all enemies of his status and not satisfied
<>with that he went to the shores of the ocean and chall-
<>enged Varun2a for a fight. Varun2a came before him and
<>very modestly admitted that he was incapable of meet-
<>ing the challenge thrown and suggested that perhaps
<>Jamadagni's son, Paras4ura1ma might accept the chall-
<>enge and give him a fight. Hearing this Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna turned towards the a1srama of Jamadagni on the
<>shores of the Narmada1 river.
<NI>(iv) {%Causes of the war (immediate).%} Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna went
<>for hunting in the forests and feeling exhausted after
<>some time went to the a1srama of Jamadagni with his
<>retinue. Jamadagni received them well and with the
<>help of the Ka1madhenu (wish-yielding cow) named
<>Sus4i1la1, Jamadagni gave a sumptuous feast to the King
<>and his followers. When after the meals were over
<>they started to take leave of the sage, Candragupta, a
<>minister of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna brought to the notice of the
<>king the superior powers of the Ka1madhenu, Sus4i1la1. The
<>king wanted to get the cow and asked Candragupta to
<>tell the sage about it. Though the minister told Jama-
<>dagni about the royal desire the sage refused to part
<>with the cow. Then the minister with the help of the
<>other royal servants took the cow by force and the sage
<>followed the cow weeping. On the way Candragupta
<>beat Jamadagni to death and brought the cow to the
<>presence of the king. The king was pleased and the royal
<>hunting party returned to the palace happy.
<NI>Jamadagni's wife Ren2uka1 went in search of her hus-
<>band and to her grief found him lying dead. Ren2uka1
<>wept beating her breast twentyone times and by that
<>time her son Para ura1ma came there and he declared
<>that he would travel round the world twentyone times,
<>the number of times his mother beat her breast, to kill
<>and exterminate the Ks2atriyas from this world. Then
<>the dead body of Jamadagni was placed on a pyre and [Page570-b+ 65]
<>they were singing Vis2n2ugi1ta1 before placing fire on the
<>pyre when S4ukramuni appeared there and brought
<>Jamadagni to life by invoking the art of Mr2tasan5ji1vani1.
<>By that time Sus4i1la1 somehow escaped from the custody
<>of the King and came there without the calf. Then
<>Paras4ura1ma vowed that he would bring the calf soon and
<>taking with him his disciple Akr2tavran2a he left for the
<>city of Ma1his2mati1 the abode of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. There
<>they fought a grim battle and after killing Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna and many of his followers brought back the calf.
<>To atone for the sin of this massacre Jamadagni advised
<>his son to go and perform penance in Mahendragiri.
<>Taking advantage of the absence of Paras4ura1ma from
<>the a1s4rama, S4u1rasena son of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna, with his
<>followers went to the a1s4rama of Jamadagni and chop-
<>ped off his head. Paras4ura1ma returned from Mahend-
<>ragiri at once and cremated the dead body of his father.
<>Ren2uka1, his mother, jumped into the funeral pyre
<>and abandoned her life. From that moment onwards
<>started Paras4ura1ma's fierce programme of mass mass-
<>acre of the Ks2atriyas.
<NI>(v) {%Victory march.%} Paras4ura1ma's world-tour was con-
<>fined to an all-Bha1rata tour. The wars of Paras4ura1ma
<>are not described in detail in the Pura1n2as. They men-
<>tion that2 Paras4ura1ma killed the Kings of Cola, Cera
<>and Paun2d2ra. To stop the birth of Ks2atriyas in future
<>Paras4ura1ma destroyed even the embryo in the wombs
<>of Ks2atariya women. Then the Bha1rgava ancestors like
<>R2ci1ka and others came to the sky and requested Paras4u-
<>ra1ma to stop this slaughter. They said: “Oh son,
<>Ra1ma, stop this slaughter. What good do you get by
<>killing innocent Ks2atriyas?” By that time Paras4ura1ma
<>had made twentyone rounds around Bha1rata killing the
<>Ks2atriyas. (Chapter 64, A1di Parva; Chapter 38, Sabha1
<>Parva; Chapter 116, Vana Parva; Chapter 49, S4a1nti
<>Parva and 10 chapters from chapter 83 of Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>7) {%Samantapan5cakanirma1n2a.%} Samantapan5caka is Kuru-
<>ks2etra itself where the great battle was conducted.
<>This is a holy place and it was Paras4ura1ma who
<>constructed it. He stored the blood of the Ks2atriyas he
<>killed in the twentyone rounds of killing in five lakes in
<>Samantapan5caka. He offered blood to the Manes in
<>those lakes. The Manes led by R2ci1ka appeared before
<>him and asked him to name any boon he wanted. Then
<>Paras4ura1ma said, “Revered Manes, if you are pleased
<>with me you must absolve me from the sin of this mass
<>massacre of the Ks2atriyas and declare the five lakes
<>where I have stored their blood as holy.” The Manes
<>declared, “Let it be so.” From then onwards the
<>place became holy under the name Samantapan5caka.
<>At the end of the Dva1parayuga and the beginning of
<>Kaliyuga a great battle lasting for eighteen days took
<>place at this holy place between the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas. (Chapter 2, A1di Parva).
<NI>8) {%Atonement.%} To atone for the sin of slaughtering even

<>The chief R2tvik (officiating priest) of the Ya1ga was

<>After the worship was over according to the instructions [Page571-a+ 65]
<>from Kas4yapa the gold platform was cut into pieces
<>and the gold pieces were offered to brahmins.

<>said thus:--“Oh Ra1ma, you have given me all your
<>land and it is not now proper for you to live in my
<>soil. You can go to the south and live somewhere on
<>the shores of the ocean there.” Paras4ura1ma walked
<>south and requested the ocean to give him some land to
<>live. Varun2a then asked him to throw a winnow into
<>the ocean. There is a legend saying that it was a
<>Paras4u that Paras4ura1ma threw. Paras4ura1ma threw the

<>distance where the winnow fell from where he stood.
<>This is the place S4u1rpa1raka now known as Kerala.

<>returning to Ayodhya1 from Mithila1puri1 after the
<>marriage along with the sage Vasis2t2ha through a deep
<>forest when Paras4ura1ma blocked their way and add-

<>I heard that you broke during the marriage of Si1ta1 the
<>great S4aiva bow of the palace of Janaka. It was a
<>S4aiva bow and I have now come here to test your
<>prowess. I am giving you a Vais2n2ava bow now. Can
<>you string this bow?”
<NI>Vasis2t2ha tried his best to pacify Paras4ura1ma. But
<>Paras4ura1ma without heeding it started describing the
<>story and greatness of the S4aiva bow and the Vais2n2ava
<>bow. (See under Vais2n2ava bow). Then S4ri1 Ra1ma took
<>the bow from Paras4ura1ma and started to string it. The
<>brilliance of S4ri1 Ra1ma dazzled him and he stood
<>dumbfounded at his skill. Paras4ura1ma was immensely
<>pleased and he blessed S4ri1 Ra1ma. After that he went
<>again to Mahendragiri to perform penance.
<NI>This same story is told in Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a with
<>some slight changes:--Paras4ura1ma did not like S4ri1
<>Ra1ma breaking the bow of his Guru S4iva. So an
<>angered Paras4ura1ma blocked the way of S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>challenged him to string and take aim with the mighty
<>Vais2n2ava bow he (Paras4ura1ma) was carrying with him
<>then. S4ri1 Ra1ma with perfect ease took the bow, strung
<>it, and taking the missile asked Paras4ura1ma to show the
<>target. Paras4ura1ma was astonished and was in a fix.
<>The missile could destroy even the entire Universe. So
<>Paras4ura1ma asked Ra1ma to aim at the accumulated
<>tapobala (power accrued by penance) of his self and
<>Ra1ma did so. Then Paras4ura1ma surrendered to S4ri1
<>Ra1ma the Vais2n2ava bow and arrow and the Vais2n2ava
<>tejas (divine brilliance) in him. Paras4ura1ma after
<>having carried out the purpose of his incarnation gave
<>instructions to S4ri1 Ra1ma to continue the purpose of his
<>incarnation and then after blessing S4ri1 Ra1ma went
<>again to do penance at his holy a1s4rama.
<NI>This same story is told by the sage Lomas4a to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas during their exile in the forests. This story is
<>much different from the previous ones: “When the
<>fame that S4ri1 Ra1ma was the best of Kings spread far
<>and wide Paras4ura1ma once went to see S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Giving him the bow and arrow with which he had
<>done the mass massacre of the Ks2atriyas he challenged [Page571-b+ 65]
<>him to string it and take aim. With a smile S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>did so and then Paras4ura1ma said Ra1ma should draw
<>the string up to his ears. S4ri1 Ra1ma got angry and then
<>on the face, which became fierce, by his anger, Paras4u-
<>ra1ma saw besides himself, A1ditya-Vasu-Rudras, Sa1dh-
<>yas, Ba1lakhilyas, Devars2is, oceans, mountains, the
<>Vedas and all such things of this universe. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>sent out his missile from the bow. The whole universe
<>was thrown into chaos. Thunder and lightning rocked
<>the world. Heavy rains flooded the whole land space.
<>Burning stars and meteors fell to the ground. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma then knew that S4ri1 Ra1ma was the incarnation of
<>Maha1vis2n2u and he stood bowing before him. Ashamed
<>of his defeat he took leave of S4ri1 Ra1ma and went to
<>Mahendragiri. When he reached there he found he had
<>lost all his brilliance. Then the manes appeared and
<>advised him to go and bathe in the river Vadhu1-

<>Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma with a view to enjoying
<>the abundance of Nature went to the beautiful
<>mountain of Gomanta and ascended to its top. On their
<>way they met Paras4ura1ma engaged in penance there. They
<>exchanged greetings and talked to each other for some
<>time. Then Paras4ura1ma requested S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to kill
<>S4r2ga1lava1sudeva, King of Karavi1ra on the base of that
<>mountain. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a promised to do so and left the
<>place carrying with him the blessings of the sage.
<NI>The second meeting was when Kr2s2n2a was going to the
<>court of the Kauravas as a messenger of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>On his way S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a saw a company of sages coming
<>and, alighting from his chariot Kr2s2n2a talked with them.
<>Paras4ura1ma who was in that company then embraced
<>Kr2s2n2a and said that he should give a true picture of
<>the situation to the Kauravas when he was conducting
<>his mission. The sages blessed Kr2s2n2a and wished Kr2s2n2a
<>all success in his mission. (Chapter 83, Udyoga Parva;

<NI>(ii) Paras4ura1ma was present at the course of the
<>Kauravas when S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was speaking to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas. When the Kauravas did not
<>reply the questions put by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Paras4ura1ma rose
<>up to tell a story to illustrate the evils resulting from
<>the arrogance of man. There was once a King called
<>Dambhodbhava who was very arrogant because of his
<>great strength. He wanted to diffuse his energy by
<>fighting and laboured much to get good opponents and
<>roamed about in search of fighters. One day the
<>brahmins directed him to Narana1ra1yan2as and accord-
<>ingly Dambhodbhava went to their a1s4rama at
<>Badarika1 and challenged them for a fight. They refused
<>to fight and yet the King showered arrows on them.
<>Then the sages took a few blades of the is2i1ka1 grass and
<>threw them at him. They filled the sky as great
<>missiles and the King begged to be pardoned and

<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Pari1ks2it was the son born to Abhimanyu of
<>Uttara1. This was a still-born child and it was S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a who gave it life. There is a story in Maha1-
<>bha1rata about this:
<NI>Uttara1, wife of Abhimanyu, was pregnant when the
<>war between the Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas started at
<>Kuruks2etra. As4vattha1ma1, son of Dron2a, entered the
<>camp of the Pa1n2d2avas at night and slew Dhr2s2t2adyumna.
<>He then sent the most fierce Brahmas4ira1stra (missile of
<>Brahmas4ira) to exterminate the Pa1n2d2avas. To face it
<>and oppose it Arjuna also sent an equally fierce
<>Brahmas4ira1stra. The sight of two such powerful weapons
<>opposing each other made all the sages anxious and
<>they led by Vya1sa entered the field and requested them
<>to withdraw their missiles. It was in vain. The missile
<>of As4vattha1ma1 went and struck the womb of Uttara1.
<NI>Once when the Pa1n2d2avas after their exile were
<>staying in the village of Upaplavya a brahmin had
<>predicted to Uttara1 that at the fag end of the life of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas Uttara1 would bear a son who would be
<>tested even while in her womb and that the child
<>should be named Pari1ks2it. (Pari1ks2a1 = test).
<NI>The child in the womb died when the missile struck it.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was greatly agitated by this wicked act of
<>As4vattha1ma1 and he said thus: “Oh As4vattha1ma1, the
<>child now dead in its womb would surely come to life
<>again. You will be called a sinner because of this in-
<>fanticide. Because of this you will roam about on earth
<>for three thousand years and during that time nobody
<>would mingle with you. You will not get a seat any-
<>where. All diseases will find an abode in your body.
<>But this infant would grow up into a king and rule the
<>country for sixty years. He would become celebrated
<>as the next Kurura1ja.” (Sauptika Parva, Maha1bha1rata)
<>When the Bha1ratayuddha came to an end Dharmaputra
<>performed an as4vamedhaya1ga. Many prominent per-
<>sons including S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a assembled at Hastina1pura for
<>this purpose. Vidura received them all. At that time
<>they were informed that Uttara1 had delivered a still-
<>born child. Pari1ks2it was born when the embryo was
<>only six months old (S4loka 82, Chapter 85, A1di
<>Parva). Everybody assembled there was sad and dep-
<>ressed when he heard this news. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went in and
<>saw the dead infant. Uttara1 wept bitterly and every-
<>body asked S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to give life to the infant somehow.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did so and the child was named Pari1ks2it
<>remembering the prophetic words of the bra1hman2a.
<NI>2). {%Marriage.%} Pari1ks2it married a princess named Ma1dra-
<>vati1 and got of her four sons named Janamejaya, S4ruta- [Page573-a+ 65]
<>sena, Ugrasena and Bhi1masena. Chapters 3, 4, 5, A1di
<>Parva).
<NI>3). {%Curse of a sage.%} Pari1ks2it was greatly interested in
<>hunting. Once he went to a big forest with his large
<>retinue to hunt. While hunting he followed a deer
<>which the king had struck with his arrow and he sepa-
<>rated from the rest and went a long way deep into the
<>forest. It was midday and the king was tired. Then he
<>saw a sage sitting there and the king went in and asked
<>him about the deer. The sage engrossed in his medita-
<>tion did not hear that. The king mistook his silence to
<>be arrogance and taking the dead body of a cobra lying
<>nearby with the tip of his bow threw it round the neck
<>of the sage and went his way. The sage did not know
<>even that. The king returned to the palace after the
<>hunting.
<NI>The sage had a son named Gavija1ta (In many places
<>the name S4r2n3gi1 is used for Gavija1ta). He was playing
<>with the sons of other sages. One munikuma1ra (son of
<>a sage) said, “Oh Gavija1ta, your father is equal to S4iva.
<>Both have a serpent round their necks. But there is only
<>one difference. The serpent round your father's neck
<>is a dead one.” Gavija1ta was greatly disturbed by this
<>jeer and he immediately went to the a1s4rama to make
<>enquiries. When he knew that an unknown person had
<>done that foul deed he took water in his hand and said
<>“Whoever be the person who put this dead snake round
<>the neck of my father will die being bitten by the fierce
<>cobra Taks2aka within seven days.” Only after pronounc-
<>ing this horrible curse did he find out that the perpet-
<>rator of that crime was none other than the most noble
<>and charitable king, Pari1ks2it. Gavija1ta repented greatly
<>and immediately sent word to the king about his curse
<>through Gauramukha, a munikuma1ra. The king was a
<>bit frightened first but then he started thinking about
<>the way to escape from the curse. (Chapter 40, A1di
<>Parva, and 2nd Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>4.) {%Taks2aka gets ready.%} As soon as the messenger Gaura-
<>mukha departed from the palace Pari1ks2it called the
<>ministers to his side and conferred with them to find a
<>way to escape from the cobra Taks2aka. They built a
<>building on a huge pillar and gave all protections to
<>the building. Brahmins well-versed in all the mantras
<>and Vis2avaidyas (physicians in the treatment of snake-
<>poisoning) of fame were asked to sit around the pillar
<>and the place was well-guarded. The King sat in a
<>room tightly closed. Six days went by. On the seventh
<>day the celebrated Vis2avaidya Ka yapamahars2i was on
<>his way to the palace at the summons of the king.
<>Taks2aka was also on his way to the palace in the guise
<>of a brahmin. They met on the way and though
<>Kas4yapa did not know him first Taks2aka introduced
<>himself when he knew that Kas4yapa was going to the
<>palace to treat the king if anything happened. He said
<>“Oh Kas4yapa, I am Taks2aka and none of your wits
<>would be able to fight against the effects of my poison.
<>If you want to know it we shall make a trial.” Saying
<>so Taks2aka went and bit a big banyan tree standing
<>nearby, and lo! the whole tree was burnt to ashes by
<>the strength of the poison. Kas4yapa smilingly recited
<>the Vis2aha1ri mantra and sprinkled some water on the
<>ashes and lo! the tree stood in its place again with not
<>a single mutilation anywhere. Taks2aka was astounded.
<>He then bribed Kas4yapa. He said he would give him
<>more than what could be expected of the king and [Page573-b+ 64]
<>requested him to return home. Kas4yapa returned and
<>Taks2aka went to the palace.
<NI>5) {%Death of Pari1ks2it.%} Taks2aka went and inspected the
<>palace of Pari1ks2it. There was no way to step in and
<>Taks2aka was astonished at the perfect protection given
<>to the king. Taks2aka called all his relatives to his side
<>and asked them to go to the King in the guise of
<>brahmins carrying several kinds of fruits as presents.
<>Taks2aka crept inside a beautiful fruit in the shape of a
<>worm and was carried along with the fruits taken to
<>the king. The servants of the king took the fruits
<>brought by the brahmins to the king and the king struck
<>by the size and beauty of a fruit among them took it and
<>cut it open. He saw a worm inside red in colour with
<>two black spots as eyes. The king took it in his hand and
<>at that instant it changed into Taks2aka and bit the king.
<>After that it rose up into the air and disappeared. (Cha-

<>The king entered the waters of the river with his horse
<>and after quenching the thirst of the horse and drinking
<>some water to quench his own thirst, he bound the
<>horse to a nearby tree and lay on the shores to take rest.
<>Then he heard from somewhere a melodious song.
<>The king raised his head and enjoying the music,
<>waited to see the origin of it. Then a beautiful damsel
<>appeared before him and the king talked with her and
<>their conversation ended in the king requesting her to
<>be his wife. The beautiful maiden consented on one
<>condition that she should not be made to touch water.
<>The king agreed and by that time the king's followers
<>came and the king took her to his palace in a decorated
<>palanquin followed by his retinue. The king took her
<>to a secret chamber and stayed with her allowing no-
<>body to enter the room. The chief minister came to
<>the palace and enqired what was happening there and
<>the maidens attending on the queen said that it was
<>strange that no water was allowed inside the room.
<>Then the minister arranged a garden with beautiful
<>flowers and fruits with no water anywhere and a pond
<>in the middle in which water was not visible from
<>outside. He then went to the king and told him of his
<>arrangement and the king took his wife into the garden
<>and started having amorous sport with her there.
<>After some time they reached the pond; water was not
<>visible and so they entered the pond. The moment
<>they entered the pond they touched water and the
<>queen disappeared in the water. The King asked the
<>water of the pond to be emptied and then he saw a
<>frog sitting at the bottom. The king accused the frog
<>of having eaten the maiden and he started killing all
<>the frogs of his state. The frogs became frightened and
<>they went to their king and complained. The frog-
<>king in the garb of a mahars2i went and requested the
<>king to stop this massacre of frogs but the king refused
<>to yield saying that a frog had eaten his wife. Hearing

<NI>Hearing this the king pleaded to the frog-king to give
<>him back Sus4obhana1. He gave Sus4obhana1 to Pari1ks2it. [Page574-b+ 65]
<>But he cursed his daughter that she would bear
<>misbehaving children because of her cheating many
<>kings before. A1yus disappeared then. Pari1ks2it begot
<>of Sus4obhana1 three princes named S4ala, Bala and Dala.
<>When S4ala grew up Pari1ks2it crowned him as king and
<>left for the forests for doing penance. (Chapter 192, Vana-
<>Parva).

<HI>PA1RIYA1TRA. A mountain of Pura1n2ic fame. The deity
<>of this mountain Pa1riya1tra was a member of the

<>son for her she requested Varun2a to grant her a boon
<>that her son would not be killed by anybody. Varun2a
<>while granting her the boon gave the son a mace. That [Page575-a+ 64]
<>mace had a peculiarity. If the mace was used against
<>anybody who was not fighting, the mace would turn
<>back and kill the user. With the help of that mace
<>S4ruta1yudha gave Arjuna a fierce fight and in the
<>midst of the heat he forgot the condition stipulated by

<>village a brahmin of Agastyagotra, well-learned, named
<>S4armi1. One day the messengers of Ka1la (god of death)
<>came to that village and by mistake took S4armi1 to
<>Yamaloka. It was only when they reached there that
<>they understood their folly and Ka1la then asked his
<>men to carry him back to earth. Then S4armi1 said he
<>would spend the balance of life due to him in Yama-
<>loka itself. But Yama did not allow that. Ka1la then

<>Vastra (Gingelly and clothes) and sent him back to
<>earth. (Chapter 68, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>PARN2AYA. A demon of R2gvedic times. He had two

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u--
<>Brahma1--Mari1ci--Paurn2ama1sa--Parvata.
<NI>Praja1pati Mari1ci got of his wife Sambhu1ti a son named
<>Paurn2ama1sa. Paurn2ama1sa got two sons Virajas and
<>Parvata. Parvata's mother was the sister of Na1rada.
<>(Chapter 10, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%Na1rada and Parvata.%} These two sages lived for a
<>long time as inseparable friends. Once they travelled on
<>earth in the form of human beings. They decided that
<>each should speak out what he felt without reserve and
<>if anybody broke the arrangement the other had the
<>right to curse him.
<NI>During their travels they reached the palace of a King
<>called Sr2n5jaya (San5jaya) and they stayed there as his
<>guests for a long time. Damayanti1 (Madayanti1)
<>daughter of the King served them both and Na1rada
<>fell in love with her. Na1rada hid this fact from
<>Parvata and within a few days Parvata came to know
<>it and he according to the agreement cursed Na1rada to
<>take the form of a monkey. Na1rada gave a counter
<>curse disabling Parvata from attaining Svarga. Both
<>separated from there and after some time both lost their
<>bitterness against each other. Parvata met Na1rada in
<>his monkey form in a forest. Both were sorry for their
<>curses then and each withdrew his curse and Na1rada
<>got his original form. He married Damayanti1 and
<>started living together and Parvata went to Svarga.
<>(Chapter 30, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}

<HI>PARVATA II. It is believed that in Kr2tayuga all
<>mountains had wings. They flew all over the world
<>with the swiftness of Garud2a or Va1yu. All beings
<>including r2s2is and devas lived in a state of suspense
<>since at any moment any mountain might fly and land
<>down on their heads. They complained to Indra and
<>Indra asked the mountains to remain at one place
<>which they flatly refused. Indra got angry and started
<>cutting down the wings of the mountains with his
<>Vajra1yudha. No mountain was able to escape from
<>this punishment; but Va1yubhagava1n carried away his
<>bosom friend, the mountain Maina1ka, and put it in
<>the ocean without anybody noticing it. So Maina1ka [Page576-a+ 64]
<>alone did not lose its wings. It was this Maina1ka
<>which rose from the ocean and gave a resting point to
<>Hanu1ma1n, son of Va1yu, when he took a leap from the
<>shores of Bha1rata to Lan3ka1. This was but an expression
<>of gratitude to Va1yu whose son Hanu1ma1n was, for the
<>help he had given when Indra was cutting off the
<>wings of all mountains. (Sarga 1, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>PARVATES4VARA. A King of Vindhyades4a. He
<>tortured his people because of his greed for money and
<>Yama sent him to hell when he died. In his next birth
<>he was born as a monkey. At that time a priest of the
<>King had taken life as a Sa1rasa bird. One day the
<>monkey tried to catch the bird and then the bird
<>(priest) reminded him of his previous birth and told
<>him that in their next birth both of them would be
<>swans and in the birth after that they would become
<>men again. (Uttara Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>PA1RVATEYA. A ra1jars2i (A King who is also a r2s2i).
<>He was born of the species of a demon named Kapat2a.
<>(S4loka 30, Chapter 67, A1di Parva).
<HI>PA1RVATI1. Wife of S4iva.
<NI>Pa1rvati1 is known under different names and worshipped
<>in different forms. Amarakos4a (Sanskrit lexicon) gives
<>the following synonyms for Pa1rvati1:
<NI>Uma1, Ka1tya1yani1, Gauri1, Ka1li1, Haimavati1, I1s4vari1,
<>S4iva1, Bhava1ni1, Rudra1n2i1, S4arva1n2i1, Sarvaman3gala1,

<>Da1ks2a1yan2i1, Girija1, Menaka1tmaja1, Ca1mun2d2a1, Karn2a-
<>mot2i1, Carccika1, Bhairavi1.
<NI>Some of these names refer to the various dispositions of
<>Pa1rvati1, while a few are the names in the various incar-
<>nations of Pa1rvati1. The origin of Pa1rvati1 and her
<>other prominent births are given below:--
<NI>1) {%Incarnation of Sati1.%} S4iva was born from Brahma1. To
<>make S4iva active, Sati1, an aspect of Maha1ma1ya1, was
<>born as the daughter of Daks2a, one of the Praja1patis.
<>The 9th Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata gives the following
<>story about the incarnation of Sati1:
<NI>While Brahma1 was engaged in creation a few daityas
<>named Ha1la1halas were born. They were very valiant
<>and ferocious and they did penance to propitiate
<>Brahma1 and after obtaining boons from him conquered
<>the three worlds and asserted their supremacy in all the
<>three worlds. They defied the Trimu1rtis (trio of Brahma1.
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva). S4iva and Vis2n2u in despair went to
<>war against them. The war continued for sixty thousand
<>years and both the daityas and Devas were exhausted.
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva refused to attend to their duties. Brahma1
<>understood the situation and taking into his hands the
<>work of S4iva and Vis2n2u also and calling his sons,
<>Sanaka and others to his side said “Oh sons, S4iva and
<>Vis2n2u are incapable of doing their work now, I have
<>therefore, taken on myself the charge of their duties also
<>and hence I do not find time to do penance. You must
<>therefore, do penance to propitiate Maha1ma1ya1. Let
<>her be pleased and when she incarnates in this universe
<>the world will be happy.”
<NI>As soon as they heard this the Praja1patis headed by
<>Daks2a went to the forests on the side of the Hima1layas.
<>They started doing penance reciting the mantra of
<>Ma1ya1bi1ja. The penance lasted for a hundred thousand
<>years and then the goddess was pleased. She graciously
<>appeared before them with three eyes and four hands [Page576-b+ 64]
<>bearing pa1s4a, an3kus4a, vara and abhi1ti. Daks2a and others
<>praised her and she granted them boons. She did also
<>promise to be born as the daughter of Daks2a. Daks2a and
<>others returned happy.
<NI>Maha1ma1ya1 incarnated as Sati1 in the house of Daks2a.
<>Sati1 blossomed into a beautiful maiden and all the
<>Praja1patis joined together and made S4iva marry her.
<>The bride and bridegroom lived in the bride's house.
<NI>At that time the sage Durva1sas worshipped Jagadambika1
<>seated at Ja1mbu1nada meditating on her and reciting the
<>ma1ya1bi1ja mantra. The devi1 was immensely pleased and
<>appearing before him gave him the divine garland lying
<>round her neck. The garland was highly perfumed.
<>Honey flowed from it always. Wearing that garland the
<>sage travelled through air and reached the palace of
<>Daks2a, father of Sati1, and gave that garland to him.
<>Daks2a received it with great delight and took it to his
<>bed-room and placed it there. That night Daks2a inhal-
<>ed the perfume of the divine garland and enjoyed an
<>amorous sport with his wife. This act made the garland
<>impure and the latent curse in it made Daks2a hate his
<>daughter Sati1 and her husband S4iva. After that Daks2a
<>conducted a Ya1ga and insulted S4iva by not inviting
<>either him or his wife. Sati1, however, attended the Ya1ga
<>uninvited and she was insulted. Unable to bear the in-
<>sult Sati1 leapt into the fire and committed suicide. From
<>that day onwards S4iva roamed about in the world
<>crying “Sati1, Sati1.”
<NI>2) {%Sati1, Pa1rvati1 (Ka1li1).%} During that time a son named
<>Vajra1n3ga was born to Kas4yapa of his wife Diti. This
<>virtuous asura practised austerities for a thousand
<>years and when he opened his eyes after his long penance
<>he did not see his wife. Vajra1n3ga started in search
<>of her collecting fruits and roots for his food on
<>the way. Then he came across her standing underneath
<>a tree weeping and she said: “All the time you were
<>doing penance, Indra was teasing me. I was living
<>without food on the banks of the river keeping a vow of
<>silence. Indra came there in the form of a monkey and
<>threw away all my articles used for worship. Then he
<>came in the form of a lion and frightened me. Then
<>again he came in the form of a serpent and bit me. Oh
<>lord, am I, your wife, an orphan?” Vajra1n3ga got angry
<>and decided to do penance again to find a remedy for
<>this unjust act of Indra. Then Brahma1 coming to know
<>of the fierce decision of Vajra1n3ga appeared before him
<>and said “Why do you go in for a penance again? Ask
<>me what you want and I shall grant you.” Vajra1n3ga
<>said “Oh Lord, I did penance all these thousand years
<>to get rid of the demoniac disposition of mine. But
<>when I was engaged in meditation Indra tormented my
<>virtuous wife very much without any reason. If you will
<>bless me I must get a son named Ta1raka to kill all the
<>devas including Indra.” Brahma1 granted the boon.
<NI>Vara1n3gi1 became pregnant and after twelve months was
<>born a son to her named Ta1raka1sura. Ta1raka did severe
<>penance sitting in the midst of Pan5ca1gni (five fires) for
<>a long time and Brahma1 was pleased and appeared
<>before him. Ta1raka then said: “If I were to die I must
<>die at the hands of a seven-day-old babe. You must
<>grant me a boon like that.” Brahma1 granted the boon.
<>Ta1raka became arrogant with that boon and joined
<>hands with such fierce demons as Prasena, Jambha and
<>Ka1lanemi to create havoc in the three worlds of Svarga, [Page577-a+ 65]
<>Bhu1mi and Pa1ta1la. They blessed the wicked and killed
<>the virtuous. It was the time when S4iva was sadly roam-
<>ing about in search of his lost wife Sati1.
<NI>All the devas headed by Indra went and complained to
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 said:--“After all, this calamity is not
<>without remedy. There is an escape from the boon I
<>have given him. Ta1raka1sura himself has allowed him
<>to be killed by a sevenday-old babe. If there should be
<>such a babe it should be from the virility of S4iva.
<>Ta1raka1sura thinks that since S4iva is observing brahma-
<>carya after the death of Sati1 there is no chance of a babe
<>being born to him. That was why he was prepared to
<>allow that clause in that boon. I shall therefore suggest
<>a plan. Sati1 herself should be born as the daughter
<>of Himava1n and Mena1 in the name of Ka1li1. Ka1li1 should
<>do great penance and break the vow of celibacy of S4iva.
<>If S4iva accepts her as his wife and a child is born to
<>them we are saved.”
<NI>S4iva was all this time spending his time thinking of
<>Sati1. Once during this time S4iva bathed in the river
<>Ka1lindi1 and then the waters of the river Ka1lindi1 be-
<>came black and the waters remained black ever since
<>that.
<NI>Indra and others on their return from Brahma1 went to
<>Br2haspati to think about further procedure in the
<>matter. Br2haspati said:--“No obstacle would ever come
<>to any act of the devas. Himava1n was doing penance
<>for a long time to obtain a child and by the grace of S4iva,
<>Sati1 has already been born as the daughter of Himava1n.
<>(Skanda Pura1n2a in its Sambhava Ka1n2d2a states thus
<>about the birth of Sati1 as Pa1rvati1. “Sati1 before
<>jumping into the fire meditated on S4iva and prayed
<>that she should be born in her next birth as his wife.
<>S4iva granted that request. It was at that time that Hima-
<>va1n along with his wife Mena1 went to the vicinity of
<>Amr2tasaras and started doing penance to get a child.
<>One day when Himava1n and his wife were bathing in
<>the saras they saw a gem of a girl in the waters and
<>they took it. Then they found the child with four hands
<>and all other emblems of goddess on her. They praised
<>her with verses from Vedas and soon the divine emblems
<>faded away and Himava1n gave the child to his wife.”)
<>Brahma1 never wanted Ta1raka to know that the child
<>was an incarnation of Devi1 and so he made the
<>babe black by sending Nis4a1 to do so. Nis4a1 entered the
<>womb of the pregnant Mena1 while she was sleeping with
<>her mouth open one day. The child was like a sapphire idol.
<>Himava1n was surprised to see the child. The child will
<>do severe penance and obtain S4iva as her husband. S4iva
<>and Sati1 will never be separated in any of their births.
<>Oh Indra now go and try to get S4iva interested in a
<>married life.”
<NI>Himava1n and Mena1 had three daughters and a son.
<>The devas were watching who among the three--Ra1gin2i1,
<>Kut2ila1 and Ka1li1--would become the consort of S4iva.
<>All the three were interested in penance. The devas
<>took Ra1gin2i1 to Brahmaloka and showed her to Brahma1
<>and the latter declared that Ra1gin2i1 was incapable of
<>bearing the virility of S4iva. Ra1gin2i1 got angry and
<>Brahma1 cursed her and made her into Sandhya1ra1ga
<>and she took her place in the sky. Then the devas took
<>Kut2ila1 to Brahma1 and the latter said that she was
<>also incapable of being a mate of S4iva. Kut2ila1 also
<>got angry and Brahma1 made her into a river and kept
<>her in Brahmaloka. Mena1 was greatly distressed at [Page577-b+ 65]
<>the loss of her two daughters and so she advised Ka1li1,
<>her third daughter to go home, discontinuing the
<>penance. She at first said Uma1 (Ma1 = do not) and so
<>she got the name of Uma1 She was the daughter of a
<>Parvata (Himava1n is a parvata (mountain2) and so she
<>got the name Pa1rvati1 (mountain-girl) also. Ka1li1 later
<>went home. But after some time the natural inclination
<>in her led her to start a severe penance again.
<NI>The young Ka1li1, who was only a small girl then, accom-
<>panied by two of her girl companions went to the shores
<>of a river deep in the forests and started practising
<>austerities. In summer she would sit in the midst of
<>Pan5ca1gni (five fires) and in the rainy season she would
<>sit in water and do penance. The penance lasted for a
<>thousand years.
<NI>S4iva who was roaming about in search of Sati1 went once
<>to the palace of Himava1n. S4iva agreed to stay there for
<>some time at the persistent request of Himava1n. During
<>his stay there S4iva understood that one of the daughters
<>of his host was doing penance meditating on S4an3kara.
<>Curious to know more about her, S4iva one day went
<>to the a1s4rama of Ka1li1. Ka1li1 saw S4iva and she stood up
<>bowing before him. S4iva was pleased with her. But
<>before Ka1li1 could have another look at S4iva, he vanished
<>from there.
<NI>Ka1li1 was disappointed and continued her penance again.
<>Years went by and one day there came to her a1s4rama
<>a Vat2u (a brahmin brahmaca1ri1). Ka1li1 and her companions
<>stood up and worshipped the Vat2u who looked brilliant
<>with ashes on his body and wearing rudra1ks2a and
<>aks2ama1la1 (berry of a tree and rosary made of it) and
<>carrying in his hand a dan2d2a (stick) and a Kaman2d2alu
<>(water pot). After formal introduction the Vat2u asked
<>Ka1li1 the purpose of her penance and Ka1li1 told him all
<>about it. Then the Vat2u asked her in tones of surprise
<>why such a beautiful girl like herself born to be the wife
<>of a king, should go after a crudely dressed aged man
<>like S4iva who goes on the back of a bullock always.
<>Pa1rvati1 resented the statement of the Vat2u and got
<>angry with him. Then S4iva appeared before her in his
<>real form and married Pa1rvati1 (Ka1li1 alias Uma1) in the
<>presence of devas and mahars2is.
<NI>3) {%Pa1rvati1 changes into Gauri1.%} S4iva and Pa1rvati1 spent
<>their honeymoon travelling throughout the world. Years
<>went by like that. One day S4iva in a spirit of sport
<>called Pa1rvati1 ‘Ka1li1, Ka1li1’. Ka1li1 meant black one and
<>Pa1rvati1 was as black as sapphire. Pa1rvati1 misunderstood
<>S4iva addressing her thus two times and thought, perhaps,
<>S4iva did not like her black body and trembling with
<>grief said “If a wound is made by an arrow it will heal
<>in due course; if the top of a tree is chopped off it will
<>again blossom when the season comes; but the wound in
<>the minds of others by harsh words is never healed. It was
<>not my fault that I was born black and I would never again
<>come near you with this black body. I am going.” Saying
<>thus with a firm determination, she rose up into the air and
<>travelling for some time reached a big forest. She creat-
<>ed by her reciting the smaran2amantra four attendants
<>for her named Somaprabha1, Jaya1, Vijaya1 and Jayanti1
<>and started doing penance there. She practised severe
<>austerities standing on one foot for a hundred years and
<>then Brahma1 appeared before her and sought the reason
<>why Pa1rvati1, wife of Parames4vara should do such severe
<>penance and then she narrated to him all that had
<>happened. Brahma1 after hearing her story told her thus:-- [Page578-a+ 65]
<>“Virtuous woman, from today onwards, your black com-
<>plexion would change into one of the hue of a lotus
<>petal. Because of that ‘gaura’ hue you would be called
<>‘Gauri1’.” By the time Brahma1 finished blessing her the
<>colour changed into the one described by Brahma1.
<NI>4) {%Gauri1 changes into Ka1tya1yani1, Vindhyava1sini1, Can2d2ika1 and
<>Ca1mun2d2ika1.%} When Devi1 became Gauri1 her superficial
<>skin peeled off and dropped down, it is said.
<NI>At that time there were two great demons called
<>Rambha and Karambha. They had no sons and they
<>started severe penance. Karambha was doing penance
<>standing in deep waters and a crocodile swallowed him.
<>The crocodile was none other than Indra. Rambha did
<>penance standing in the midst of fire and finding no
<>result even after a long time decided to sacrifice himself
<>into the fire. Agnideva then appeared before him and
<>blessed him thus: “Oh Rambha, you will get a mighty
<>son of the woman you love.” Rambha stopped his
<>penance and returned home with the boon. On the way
<>he saw a beautlful she-buffalo and passion rose in him
<>and he made contacts with the buffalo. The buffalo be-
<>came pregnant and in due course delivered a child
<>which later on became the notorious Mahis2a1sura. In
<>the meantime a buffalo loved Mahis2a1sura's mother and
<>it attacked Rambha and gored him to death. The
<>Yaks2as burnt his dead body in a funeral pyre and the
<>she-buffalo jumped into the pyre and abandoned her
<>life. From that pyre there arose then another demon
<>and he was the notorious Raktabi1ja. Mahis2a1sura became
<>the king of demons and Raktabi1ja, Can2d2a and Mun2d2a
<>became his ministers. They attacked the devas and drove
<>them to exhaustion. The devas took refuge in Brahma1
<>to think of a plan to kill those asuras. Vis2n2u, and S4iva
<>took part in the conference. Vis2n2u the eternal, got
<>angry along with S4iva and became fierce like the fire
<>of death. Brahma1 and the devas also became angry and
<>from the face of everyone a brilliance emanated and all
<>these brilliances joined together and reached the holy
<>a1s4rama of Ka1tya1yana mahars2i and that eminent sage
<>also sent out a brilliance. The ascetic brilliance joined
<>with the divine brilliance and the combined brilliance
<>shone like a thousand suns. Then this superior brilliance
<>entered the peeled-off skin of Ka1li1 to produce the
<>fierce and divine form of a goddess named Ka1tya1yani1.
<>Each limb of the new form was made up of the brillian-
<>ce from a particular god as follows: From the brilliance
<>of Mahendra was formed the face; from Agni, the eyes;
<>from Yama, the hair; from Vis2n2u, the eighteen hands;
<>from Indra, the central parts; from Varun2a, the hip
<>and the thighs; from Brahma1, the feet; from Su1rya,
<>the toes; from Praja1pati, the teeth; from Vasus, the
<>fingers of the hands; from Yaks2a, the nose; from Va1yu
<>the ears and from the ascetic brilliance, the erotic eyebrows.
<>Thus Ka1tya1yani1 shone in the world with a figure formed
<>with distinctive perfection.
<NI>All the gods and devas presented Ka1tya1yani1 with gifts:--
<>S4iva gave her a trident (tris4u1la); Vis2n2u a Discus;
<>Varun2a, a conch; Agni, a javelin; Va1yu, a bow; Su1rya,
<>a never-empty quiver; Indra, Vajraghan2t2a1; Yama,
<>a dan2d2a (stick); Vais4ravan2a, a mace; Brahma1, a rosary
<>garland; Ka1la, a sword and shield; Candra, Ca1mara
<>(white brush-like fan) and a pearl necklace; Ocean
<>a garland; Himava1n, a lion; Vis4vakarma1, a moon-
<>disced Cu1d2a1man2i, earrings and a dagger; the King of
<>Gandharvas, a silver-plated drinking cup; the King of [Page578-b+ 65]
<>na1gas, a na1gaha1ra; and the R2tus (seasons), never-
<>fading flowers. The three-eyed Ka1tya1yani1 on getting
<>all these was highly pleased and made a roaring sound.
<>Devi1, thus worshipped and adored by all, mounted on
<>the lion and went to the topmost peak of the Vindhyas.
<>Indra and Agni went and served Ka1tya1yani1 thus living
<>there. Vindhya called Devi1, Kaus4iki1 and Agastya
<>called her Durga1.
<NI>Mahis2a1sura once went to the Vindhyas after conquering
<>all the three worlds. He was accompanied by his
<>ministers, Raktabi1ja, Can2d2a, Mun2d2a, Ciks2ura and
<>Naraka. They met there the goddess Ka1tya1yani1.
<>Mahis2a1sura fell in love with the beautiful and well-
<>figured Ka1tya1yani1 and he sent Dundubhi as messenger
<>to the goddess to make her know his desire. Dundubhi
<>approached Ka1tya1yani1 and told her to become the wife
<>of Mahis2a, the emperor of all the three worlds. Devi1
<>replied that she would accept as her husband one who
<>defeated her and that was the custom also in her
<>caste. Mahis2a1sura with a huge army and heavy equip-
<>ments went to war with her. But Ka1tya1yani1 entered
<>the field alone mounted on her lion and the devas
<>watching her enter the battlefield without wearing
<>even an armour were shocked. Devi1 went forward
<>reciting the mantra of Vis2n2upan5ca1ks2ara given to her
<>by S4iva and lakhs and lakhs of demons were killed by
<>the adroit sword-swinging and the dinning roar of
<>Ka1tya1yani1. Mahis2a and his ministers surrounded her
<>and Devi1 stepping down from the lion started to dance
<>wielding her sword. Swinging her sword to the rhythm
<>of her dance-steps Devi1 picked up the leading demons
<>one by one and killed them. Seeing that, Mahis2a1sura
<>approached her, burning with rage like the pralaya1gni.
<>All the attendants of Devi1 fled. Those who remained
<>were trampled to death by Mahis2a1sura. Devi1 at first
<>killed the ministers and then faced Mahis2a1sura. Mahis2a
<>became an elephant and Devi1 cut off its trunk. The
<>elephant became a buffalo then. Devi1 sent a spike and
<>it broke. Even Devi1's Discus, granted to her by Vis2n2u was
<>blunted when it hit the rock-like body of Mahis2a1sura.
<>Varun2apa1s4a, Yamadan2d2a and Indravajra were all
<>alike fruitless against the mighty Mahis2a1sura. Angered
<>Devi1 jumped on the buffalo form of the demon and
<>drove it to exhaustion and when at last its power of
<>resistance had failed, Devi1 plunged her spear into the
<>ears of the buffalo and the demon fell dead.
<NI>Many years went by. Kas4yapa begot of his wife Danu
<>three great sons named S4umbha, Nis4umbha and Namuci.
<>All were fierce demons. Namuci attacked Indra but
<>they soon came to a compromise. But Indra hid in the
<>foam of the ocean which entered the ears, nose and
<>mouth of Namuci while he was playing in the ocean.
<>Indra used his Vajra1yudha from inside and killed him.
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha were angry and they entered
<>svarga and defeating everyone there, carried all the
<>riches from there to the earth. They met Raktabi1ja and
<>he said “Oh Lords, I am Raktabi1ja, minister of Mahi-
<>s2a1sura. Ka1tya1yani1 Devi1 killed virtuous Mahis2a1sura.
<>His two ministers Can2d2a and Mun2d2a are hiding inside
<>the ocean afraid of Ka1tya1yani1 devi1.” While he was speak-
<>ing thus Can2d2a and Mun2d2a also came there. When
<>they all exchanged ideas S4umbha called one of his men
<>and said “Bho: Sugri1va1sura, go and tell Ka1tya1yani1 to
<>be my wife.” Sugri1va went to Ka1tya1yani1 and returned
<>disappointed and said “Lords S4umbha and Nis4umbha, [Page579-a+ 65]
<>I told Devi1 your message and she only laughed. She
<>said that S4umbha and Nis4umha might be mighty lords
<>but only those who defeated her could marry her.”
<NI>Enraged at this arrogance of Ka1tya1yani1, S4umbha sent
<>Dhu1mra1ks2a to drag Ka1tya1yani1 down to him. Dhu1mra1ks2a
<>with six Aks2auhin2i1s of soldiers went to the seat of
<>Ka1tya1yani1 and challenged her to a fight. Devi1 stepped
<>down from her seat and stood before Dhu1mra1ks2a and
<>the latter leaped forward to catch hold of her. But
<>Dhu1mra1ks2a was burnt to death by the hum3ka1ra fire
<>of the goddess. Not only that, the hum3ka1ra sound
<>reached the ears of S4umbha. S4umbha felt small by this
<>prowess of the Devi1 but his rage increased. S4umbha
<>then sent Can2d2a, Mun2d2a and the great demon Ruru
<>also with an army of a hundred crores of demons to
<>face Devi1 Kaus4iki1. When the enemies reached Vindhya
<>the bhu1tas of Devi1 made loud and shrill noises. The
<>lion of Ka1tya1yani1 roared and she leaped into the midst
<>of the army sword in hand. Lakhs and lakhs of asuras
<>fell dead by the sword of the goddess. Devi1 once opened
<>her mouth and lakhs of asuras entered it and then she
<>shut her mouth keeping in her stomach the asuras till
<>they all died. Devi1 beat the demon Ruru to death.
<>Devi1 plucked her matted hair and struck it on the
<>ground and from there arose the fierce form of Ca1mun2d2i1.
<>Can2d2a and Mun2d2a fled but Ca1mun2d2i1 followed them to
<>Pa1ta1la and catching hold of them chopped off their
<>heads and presented them to Ka1tya1yani1. Then Devi1,
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 and the bhu1tas together tore to pieces all the
<>remaining asuras and stored them all in their stomachs.
<>Hearing this S4umbha's rage knew no bounds and he
<>started with an army of thirty crores of men. The army
<>swept on like an ocean and finding it moving forward
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 roared. Ka1tya1yani1 made a sound like a lion's
<>roar. Brahma1n2i1 holding high the dagger jumped down to
<>fight. Ma1hes4vari1 with snakes and the spike, with the
<>three eyes open got down in fits of anger. Kauma1ri1
<>with the javelin hanging round her waist and bright
<>eyes entered the field. Vais2n2avi1 swinging her sword and
<>whirling the mace with many weapons rushed to the
<>field. Va1ra1hi1 breaking open the earth with its tusk and
<>bearing a large wooden pestle came to fight. Indra1n2i1
<>with diamond on her sides came to fight. Na1rasim3hi1
<>brushing the manes on her breast, shaking the stars and
<>whirling the planets and making a fierce appearance
<>came to the field. (Ca1mun2d2i1, Brahma1n2i1, Ma1hesvari1,
<>Vais2n2avi1, Va1ra1hi1 and Na1rasim3hi1 are the different forms
<>of Ka1tya1yani1. They are called Saptama1tr2s (seven
<>mothers). These saptama1tr2s were born when-Ka1tya1yani1
<>in her wrath beat the earth with her matted hair).
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 roared. The world became dark. Hearing
<>the roar S4iva descended to the field. The Asuras
<>surrounded the Devi1 again. But they all fell dead with
<>blood flowing in a stream. The dead bodies of the
<>asuras became heaped up and in despair S4umbha and
<>Nis4umbha wept. Seeing that, Raktabi1ja got angry and
<>rushed at Devi1. The Saptama1tr2s shouted and Ca1mun2d2i1
<>opened her mouth. The lower jaw of Ca1mun2d2i1 touched
<>Pa1ta1la when she opened her mouth from the sky.
<>Raktabi1ja, wounded and bleeding by a dagger stroke of
<>Ca1mun2d2i1, fell into the mouth of Ca1mun2d2i1 and dis-
<>appeared. Then Nis4umbha interfered and the fight be-
<>came one between Nis4umbha and Devi1. The fat and sturdy
<>hands of Nis4umbha and the mace he was carrying fell
<>by an arrow sent by Devi1. Then Devi1 struck him with [Page579-b+ 65]
<>her spike and Nis4umbha was killed. Both S4umbha and
<>Nis4umbha who came to weeak vengeance on her were
<>thus killed. (See under Lan3ka1laks2mi1 to know how Pa1rvati1
<>became Lan3ka1laks2mi1).
<NI>5) {%Pa1rvati1 takes the forms of Elephant and monkey.%} S4iva
<>and Pa1rvati1 went about enjoying amorous sports in the
<>forests. S4iva turned himself into a tusker and Pa1rvati1
<>became a she-elephant then. Gan2apati was born as a
<>result of that sport. S4iva became a monkey and Pa1rvati1
<>became his mate and Hanu1ma1n was born as a result
<>of that sport. (See under Gan2apati and Hanu1ma1n).
<NI>6) {%Pa1rvati1 became Si1ta1.%} This happened when Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a along with Si1ta1 were in the forests. One day
<>Si1ta1 went to the Goda1vari1 river nearby to bring water
<>to the a1s4rama and she stayed for some time watching
<>two swans playing in the midst of lotuses in the lake
<>there. Hearing a sound she looked into the river and
<>saw S4ri1 Ra1ma bathing there. She was surprised. When
<>she left the a1s4rama Ra1ma was sitting there. At the
<>same time another thing happened in the a1s4rama. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma found Si1ta1 coming to him and when he arose to
<>receive her the figure disappeared. Then S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>found bathing by Si1ta1devi1 also disappeared. When an
<>astonished Si1ta1 reached the a1s4rama she found an equally
<>astonished S4ri1 Ra1ma sitting there. They then told
<>each other their experiences and S4ri1 Ra1ma on medita-
<>tion understood that in the guise of Ra1ma and Si1ta1 S4iva
<>and Pa1rvati1 had come from Kaila1sa to know about
<>the welfare of the princes in exile.
<NI>7) {%Pa1rvati1, Vihun2d2a and Jalandhara.%} See under those

<NI>8) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Pa1rvati1 shines in the court of Brahma1. (S4loka 41,
<>Chapter 11, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) When the Pa1n2d2avas were in exile Pa1rvati1 guarded
<>Arjuna always. (Vana Parva, Chapter 37, S4loka 38).
<NI>(iii) Once Pa1rvati1 appeared in person and blessed
<>Dharmaputra. (Chapter 6, Vira1t2a Parva).
<NI>(iv) Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a pleased Pa1rvati1 and she granted
<>Kr2s2n2a boons. The first was that he would have sixteen
<>thousand wives. The next was a beautiful form for
<>Kr2s2n2a and the next was love of his relatives. Another
<>boon was that Kr2s2n2a would have the prosperity to be
<>able to give food for seven thousand travellers daily.
<>(S4loka 7, Chapter 15, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(v) It was because of a curse of Pa1rvati1 that devas do
<>not get sons by their own wives. There is the following
<>story behind that.
<NI>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 went to the Hima1layas after their
<>marriage and started living there. S4iva and Pa1rvati1
<>were so much engrossed in their amorous sport that they
<>were oblivious of the happenings outside. After a long
<>time when their sport continued without a break the
<>devas went in and informed S4iva that the whole universe
<>was trembling by their sport and if S4iva produced a
<>son the world would be incapable of bearing it and so
<>he should withdraw from the act of producing a child.
<>S4iva agreed and drew his virile strength upwards.
<>Pa1rvati1 did not like that and she cursed the devas that
<>they would never have sons of their own wives. (Cha-
<>pter 84, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vi) Pa1rvati1 once taught Gan3ga1devi1 the duties of
<>women. (S4loka 33, Chapter 146, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vii) Pa1rvati1 resides in the mount of Mun5java1n in
<>Kaila1sa with Paramas4iva. There is a mount called [Page580-a+ 64]
<>Mun5java1n in the Hima1layas. Bhagava1n Uma1pati (S4iva)
<>shines there on treetops, underneath the trees, on the
<>mounts and in caves. (Chapter 8, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(viii) The Maha1bha1rata uses the following synonyms
<>for Pa1rvati1: Ambika1, A1rya1, Uma1, Bhi1ma1, S4ailaputri1,
<>Sailara1jasuta1, S4a1kambhari1, S4arva1n2i1, Deves4i1, Devi1,

<NI>9) {%Pa1rvati1 pratis2t2ha1.%} The installation of the goddess
<>Pa1rvati1 in temples is done with the following sacred
<>rites.
<NI>An inner temple should be constructed and the idol of
<>Devi1 should be installed there. Before that, on the
<>bed of the platform bearing the idol, amulets with spi-
<>ritual inscriptions on them should be deposited there
<>just as in the case of the installation of Mahes4vara.
<>Then Para1s4akti should be consecrated there with recit-
<>als of mantras followed by the deposition of Pan5carat-
<>nas meditating on Pin2d2ika1. Then the idol of Devi1
<>should be fixed on the platform. After that Kriya1-
<>s4akti should be consecrated on the platform and Jn5a1na-
<>s4akti on the idol. Finally Ambika1 named S4iva1 should
<>be invoked with the mantras as ordained in the
<>scriptures.
<NI>The different zones like the east and the west and the
<>guards of the Universe like Indra should also be wor-
<>shipped. (Chapter 98, Agni Pura1n2a; Sarga 36, Ba1la

<NI>PA1RVATI1YA I. (PARVATI1YA). A king who lived
<>during the period of Maha1bha1rata. He was born of the
<>species of the da1nava called Kuks2i. (S4loka 56, Chapter
<>67, A1di Parva).
<HI>PA1RVATI1YA II (PARVATI1YA). Those who resided
<>in the country called Pa1rvati1ya in ancient Bha1rata were
<>called Pa1rvati1yas. Pa1rvati1yas were also present for the
<>Ra1jasu1ya of Dharmaputra. When the Pa1n2d2avas had to
<>fight against Jayadratha during their exile in the fo-
<>rests these pa1rvati1yas fought on the side of Jayadratha.
<>Arjuna killed them all. In the Kuruks2etra battle the
<>Pa1rvati1yas fought on the side of the Kauravas. Pa1rvat-
<>i1ya was a very important country of ancient Bha1rata.
<>Once the Pa1rvati1yas fought against Kr2s2n2a and Kr2s2n2a con-
<>quered them. In the great battle the pa1rvati1yas fought
<>against the Pa1n2d2avas under the banners of S4akuni and
<>Ulu1ka. The Pa1n2d2avas destroyed them all. (Chapter 52,
<>Sabha1 parva; Chapter 271, Vana Parva; Chapter 30,
<>Udyoga Parva; Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva; Chapter 11,
<>Dron2a Parva; Chapter 46, Karn2a Parva and Chapter 1,
<>S4alya Parva).
<HI>PA1S4A. A divine weapon of Varun2a. There is nothing
<>to excel this in swiftness. (S4loka 29, Chapter 41, Vana
<>Parva).
<NI>PA1S2A1N2ATI1RTHA. A sacred place. This is located in the
<>Jamadagnivedi1 in the temple of S4u1rpa1raka. (S4loka 12,
<>Chapter 38, Vana Parva). [Page580-b+ 65]
<NI>PA1S4A1S4INI1. An ancient river of Bha1rata. (S4loka 22,
<>Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PA1S4I1. One of the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Bhi1ma
<>killed him in the great battle. (S4loka 5, Chapter 84,
<>Karn2a Parva).
<HI>PA1S4IVA1T2A. A place of habitation in ancient India.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 64).
<NI>PAS4UBHU1MI. The country of Nepal. The place got
<>the name of Pas4ubhu1mi because it is located near the
<>birth place of Pas4upati (S4iva). (Chapter 30, S4loka 9,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>PAS4UDA1. A female follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>28, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<NI>PA1S4UPATA I. An aged brahmin. (See under Viru1pa1ks2a).
<NI>PA1S4UPATA. II. The missile of S4iva. Arjuna during
<>his exile in the forests performed penance to propitiate
<>S4iva and got this missile from him.
<NI>S4iva has a bow named Pina1ka. Pa1s4upata is the arrow
<>that is used on that bow. Pina1ka is a serpent with the
<>colours of a rainbow. It has seven heads and has fierce
<>canine teeth. Poison flows from them always. The string
<>of the bow is wound round the neck of S4iva. The
<>arrow, bright like the sun and equal to the fire of
<>death, is the Pa1s4upata. It will burn all that it touches.
<>Neither Na1ra1yan2a1stra, Brahma1stra, A1gneya1stra nor
<>Va1run2a1stra can stand against this. In times of old S4iva
<>burnt the Tripuras (three cities of the notorious three
<>demons) by this arrow. Even Brahma1 and Vis2n2u could
<>be killed by Pa1s4upata. (Chapter 14, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<>Devotees worship Pa1s4upata as a deity. If the Pa1s4upata
<>mantra is recited once it will remove all obstacles from
<>the way and if recited a hundred times it will end all
<>your calamities and bring success in any war for you.
<NI>PA1S4UPATA(S). The bhu1tagan2as (Spirits and devils
<>attending on him) of S4iva as a class are called Pa1s4u-
<>patas. (Chapter 67, Va1mana Pura1n2a).
<NI>PAS4USAKHA. Husband of Gan2d2a1, servant-maid of
<>the saptars2is. (See under Saptars2is).
<NI>PAT2ACCARA. A place of habitation in ancient Bha1-
<>rata. During Pura1n2ic times the people of this place mig-
<>rated to south India because they were afraid of Jara1-
<>sandha. (Chapter 14, Sabha1 Parva). Sahadeva, one of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas during his victory tour of the south, sub-
<>dued the people of this place. The pat2accaras fought
<>against the Kauravas on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>(Chapter 31, Sabha1 Parva). It was the pat2accaras who
<>stood at the back of the Kraun5ca Vyu1ha constructed
<>by the Pa1n2d2avas. (Chapter 50, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PATA1KI1. A soldier of the Kaurava army. Duryodhana
<>gave instructions to S4akuni to attack Arjuna taking
<>Pata1ki1 along with him for help. (Chapter 156, Dron2a
<>Parva).
<HI>PA1T2ALA. A monkey. This monkey met S4ri1 Ra1ma at
<>Kis2kindha1 when the latter was going to Lan3ka1 to
<>meet Vibhi1s2an2a. (Chapter 88, Sr2s2ti Khan2d2a, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>PA1TA1LA. The last of the seven regions or worlds under
<>the earth said to be peopled by Na1gas. The seven
<>regions one below the other are (1) Atala (2) Vitala
<>(3) Sutala (4) Tala1tala (5) Rasa1tala (6) Maha1tala and
<>(7) Pa1ta1la. In all these regions there are beautiful cities
<>and buildings built by Maya, the great architect. The
<>daityas, da1navas and na1gas live in these regions.
<NI>Pa1ta1la is seventy thousand yojanas high each division
<>being ten thousand yojanas high. The earth in these [Page581-a+ 63]
<>regions is of different hue like white, black, red and
<>yellow. It is filled with rubbles, black granite and
<>gold. Once Na1rada on his return to Svarga from
<>Pa1ta1la said that Pa1ta1la was more beautiful than Svarga.
<>The ornaments worn by na1gas are profusely studded
<>with shining diamonds. Daytime is lighted by the Sun
<>and the night by the Moon. There is neither heat nor
<>cold there and the happy na1gas living contentedly do
<>not feel the passage of time.
<NI>Under the Pa1ta1la is A1dis4es2a, a ta1masic form of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u, known to the Siddhas as Ananta. He has a thousand
<>heads and Svastika as his badge. Holding in one hand
<>a plough and in the other a wooden pestle he sits wor-
<>shipped by S4ri1devi1 and Va1run2i1devi1. At the time of the
<>end of the world the San3kars2an2amu1rti, Rudra, is born
<>from the face of A1dis4es2a shining brightly like poisonous
<>fire and it consumes all the three worlds. A1dis4es2a
<>worshipped by all gods bears this earth on his head
<>like a crown and sits in Pa1ta1la. When Ananta yawns
<>this world begins to quake along with its oceans, rivers
<>and forests. Nobody has seen an end of his qualities
<>and that is why he is known as Ananta (no end). It
<>was by worshipping this Ananta that the ancient sage
<>Garga learned the truth about the results of Nimittas4a1-
<>stra (predictions by omens) a division of Jyotis2a-
<>s4a1stra.
<NI>The distinguishing characteristics of each of the seven
<>divisions of Pa1ta1la are given below:--
<NI>1) {%Atala.%} The first region of Pa1ta1la. Here lives Bala,
<>the celebrated son of Maya. He has created ninetysix
<>kinds of magical arts capable of giving everything one
<>desires. Those interested in magic are even now using
<>some of these. When Bala yawns three kinds of women
<>will come out of his mouth. Pum3s4cali1s (harlots),
<>Svairin2i1s (adulteresses) and Ka1mini1s (lustful maidens).
<>These women have a charm called Ha1t2aka to tempt
<>all who enter Atala. This ha1t2aka is a rasa1yana which

<>can enjoy a sexual life with them for a prolonged period.
<>These women after enticing the men would live with
<>them enjoying a life of bliss produced by bewitching side
<>glances, charming smiles, erotic embraces and exciting
<>amorous talks. The men who live with them will be
<>in such a state of bliss that they would say with

<NI>2) {%Vitala.%} This is the abode of Ha1t2akes4vara who is
<>none other than Paramas4iva. This god accompanied
<>by Bhava1ni1devi1 and surrounded by pramathagan2as
<>(prominent demigods who attend on him) and wor-
<>shipped by devas, presides over this place increasing
<>the praja1s created by Brahma1. The semen virile of
<>Pa1rvati1-Parames4varas flows there as the river Ha1t2aki1.
<>The gold named Ha1t2aka is what is vomited by the
<>wind-blown Agni after drinking the rasa of that river.
<>The wives of daityas wear ornaments made of this
<>gold.
<NI>3) {%Sutala.%} This is the abode of Maha1bali. Here lives
<>Maha1bali meditating on Maha1vis2n2u with more glory
<>and grandeur than Indra. To please Indra, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u once went to Maha1bali on earth and by deceit
<>took all his possessions and binding him with
<>Varun2apa1s4a pushed him to Sutala through a hole made [Page581-b+ 64]
<>on earth. Later Maha1vis2n2u felt he did a wrong in
<>thus sending away Maha1bali from earth by deceit and
<>to remedy the sin committed he even now acts as a
<>gatekeeper to Maha1bali in Sutala. Once Ra1van2a
<>went to Sutala to attack Maha1bali and then Maha1vis2n2u
<>keeping watch over the palace-gate in the form of
<>Va1mana gave Ra1van2a a kick and sent him back.
<NI>4) {%Tala1tala.%} This is the place where Maya lives. This
<>Maya is a mighty magician among demons. After the
<>Tripuradahana (burning the three demons to death)
<>S4iva blessed Maya and the latter is living as Tripura1-
<>dhipati (chief of Tripura) in Tala1tala. Maya is the
<>preceptor of all demon-magicians and many fierce-
<>looking demons worship him always.
<NI>5) {%Maha1tala.%} This is the abode of Ka1draveyas. They
<>got the name because they are all children of Kadru1,
<>the cobra. All these cobras are fierce-looking multi-
<>headed ill-tempered ones. The prominent ones among
<>them are Kuhaka, Taks2aka, Sus2ena and Ka1liya. All
<>these are long lean serpents possessing big hoods and
<>great strength. These bad-tempered cobras live with
<>their family terribly afraid of Garud2a.
<NI>6) {%Rasa1tala.%} This is the residence of the notorious
<>Niva1takavaca-Ka1lakeyas. They were enemies of the
<>devas and they tormented them in many ways. The
<>majestic authority of Maha1vis2n2u decreased their
<>virility. They are now living in Rasa1tala frightened by
<>the threats and beatings with a magic wand of Sarama1,
<>a mantraru1pin2i (a sacred chant incarnate) deputed by
<>Indra.
<NI>7) {%Pa1ta1la.%} This is the abode of serpents. The
<>na1galoka1dhipatis (chiefs of the serpent world) like
<>Va1suki, S4an3kha, Gulika, S4veta, Dhanan5jaya Maha1-
<>s4ikha, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, San3khacu1d2a, Kambala, As4vadhara
<>and Devadatta live here. These are all strong, long-
<>bodied, greatly poisonous snakes with very bad tempers.
<>They all possess hoods varying in numbers from five to
<>hundred and the lustre of the diamonds on their hoods
<>keeps the region of Pa1ta1la always illuminated. At the
<>base of this Pa1ta1la-world is a place, separated from the
<>rest, thirty thousand yojanas in area. It is here that
<>the ta1masic Vis2n2ukala1 resides under the name Ananta.
<>A1dis4es2a or Ananta is the manifestation of this Vis2n2u-
<>kala1. S4ri1 Ananta has got a name San3kars2an2a meaning
<>one who proudly and arrogantly pulls at every thing
<>that is seen and unseen.
<NI>It is well-known that all the worlds are being borne on
<>his head by the thousand-hooded A1dis4es2a. When,
<>while bearing the worlds like this, he feels that he
<>should destroy the animate and inanimate objects of
<>the worlds, he brings forth from his forehead Rudra
<>named San3kars2an2a with eleven demigods and weapons
<>like tris4u1la (trident). Ananta is very beautiful with
<>divine brilliance. Other serpent chiefs prostrate before
<>him and at that time they see their reflection on the
<>diamond-mirror-like nails on the toes of Ananta and
<>for some time the serpent chiefs lie there pleasantly
<>looking at the reflection of thier own faces in the nails.
<>The earrings of dazzling brilliance worn by these ser-
<>pent chiefs reflect on their cheeks and the serpents feel
<>extremely happy when they see the reflection of their
<>faces on the nails.
<NI>The daughters of the serpent kings are all beautiful
<>damsels with fair, spotless and lustrous bodies. They [Page582-a+ 65]
<>smear their bodies with fragrant pastes made from Aloe,
<>Sandal and Saffron. They then stand around A1dis4es2a
<>with their bewitching smiles and amorous movements of
<>their bodies accompanied by erotic side glances express-
<>ing their carnal desires. The mighty, virtuous, celebrat-
<>ed A1dis4es2a sits there surrounded by serpents for the
<>welfare of the world. He sits there worshipped by
<>Devas, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Vidya1dharas and Maha-
<>rs2is, bearing the divine garland ‘Vaijayanti1’, and
<>wearing fragrant flower garlands, blue apparels and
<>ornaments in ears and neck and holding in his hand the
<>Hala1yudha. Suppressing his anger and keeping calm
<>and serene he pleases all around with his pathetic look.

<HI>PA1TA1LAKETU. A demon. This demon once carried
<>away Mada1lasa1, daughter of Vis4va1vasu to Pa1ta1la.
<>R2tadhvajara1ja defeated Pa1ta1laketu and rescued Mada1-
<>lasa1 from Pa1ta1la. (See under R2tadhvaja).
<HI>PATA1LARA1VAN2A. A leader among the demons. Ra1van2a,
<>the lord of Lan3ka1, and Pa1ta1lara1van2a are different.
<>Pa1ta1lara1van2a was the son of the sister of Ma1lyava1n. Heti,
<>son of Brahma1, begot of his wife Bhaya1 a son named
<>Vidyutkes4a. Vidyutkes4a married Sa1lakat2an3ka1 and got of
<>her Sukes4a. Sukes4a married Devavati1 and got of her
<>three sons, Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1 and Ma1li1. Of these
<>Suma1li1 got Prahasta and others who were the ministers
<>of Ra1van2a. Pa1ta1la-Ra1van2a was the son of Ma1lyava1n's
<>sister.
<NI>A set of demons afraid of Maha1vis2n2u, the destroyer of
<>demons, fled to Pa1ta1la. Their leader was Pa1ta1lara1van2a.
<>On reaching Pa1ta1la he became their leader and emperor
<>and he got the name of Pa1ta1lara1van2a from then
<>onwards.
<NI>Pa1ta1lara1van2a performed severe austerities to propitiate
<>Brahma1 and got from him three extraordinary boons:--
<>(1) To travel freely in all the worlds without the use of
<>any vehicle (2) To be well-versed in all magical arts
<>(3) To be alive till the beetle-shaped blue diamond in
<>his possession is broken into two.
<NI>Pa1ta1lara1van2a used all these boons for the welfare and
<>emancipation of his own people. He was interested in
<>teasing his enemies by the power of his boons. Ra1van2a,
<>king of Lan3ka1, had an alliance with Pa1ta1lara1van2a.
<NI>Pa1ta1lara1van2a had a cruel and huge brother named
<>Kumbhodara who was an adept in magic. This
<>brother always helped Pa1ta1la-Ra1van2a in all his activi-
<>ties.
<NI>The Ra1ma-Ra1van2a Yuddha was going on and Ra1van2a
<>began to suffer defeat after defeat in quick succession.
<>Ra1van2a then sent for Pa1ta1lara1van2a and his brother
<>Kumbhodara. Pa1ta1lara1van2a felt sorry at the pitiable
<>plight of Lan3ka1 and both the Ra1van2as sat together to
<>discuss future plans. Though they had lost a major
<>portion of their army, Ra1van2a suggested they should
<>fight with the rest of the army and kill Ra1ma. Pa1ta1la-
<>ra1van2a was to kill Ra1ma and Lan3ka1-Ra1van2a was to
<>marry Si1ta1. Pa1ta1lara1van2a said that it was unwise to
<>continue the fight with a small army but promised he
<>would make a trial by using his magic powers.
<NI>Pa1ta1lara1van2a and Kumbhodara on leaving Lan2ka1 made
<>themselves invisible and travelled above the camp of
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma to investigate the strength and manoeuvres of
<>the Ra1ma-army. It was night and the whole place was
<>lit by moonlight. The monkey soldiers were taking rest
<>in different places. Vibhi1s2an2a and Sugri1va were talking [Page582-b+ 65]
<>in secret about grave matters. S4ri1 Ra1ma was lying
<>resting his head on the lap of Laks2man2a and Laks2man2a
<>was mildly massaging the divine body of his brother.
<>Hanu1ma1n was sitting on a big dais created by his tail
<>and keeping watch over the whole camp.
<NI>Pa1ta1lara1van2a knew from what he saw that any attempt
<>to carry away Ra1ma from the surface of the ground was
<>impossible and so he returned to Pa1ta1la. From there
<>they made a tunnel up to the base of the seat of Hanu1-
<>ma1n and from there to where Ra1ma lay. Then
<>they carried Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to Pa1ta1la before any-
<>body could find it out by making them smell a sammoh-
<>anadivyaus2adha (divine medicine causing unconscious
<>ness). They brought them to a temple of Maha1ka1li1
<>with the intention of offering them in a sacrifice
<>to the deity the next day morning. They made
<>all preparations for the same. Hanu1ma1n used to inspect
<>the camp often and yet when after midnight he looked
<>at the place where Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were sleeping
<>he could not find them. He immediately woke up all
<>and made a search and they then found the big hole of
<>a tunnel near the place where Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>were sleeping. All the leaders including Sugri1va and
<>Vibhi1s2an2a assembled there and then Vibhi1s2an2a told
<>them what had happened. He then took Sugri1va,
<>Hanu1ma1n, Ja1mbava1n and An3gada and a big army to
<>Pa1ta1la and went straight to the Maha1ka1li1 temple.
<>There Pa1ta1lara1van2a had already started the ceremonies
<>for the sacrifice.
<NI>Vibhi1s2an2a then asked Hanu1ma1n to go and get the
<>beetle-shaped diamond of Pa1ta1lara1van2a from a secret
<>place in his bed chamber. Hanu1ma1n took it and kept
<>it in his mouth and attacked Pa1ta1lara1van2a who came
<>running to slay him. Pa1ta1la-Ra1van2a faced Hanu1ma1n
<>in a very indifferent manner and a fight ensued. After
<>sometime Hanu1ma1n lost patience and cracked the
<>diamond within his mouth and the moment it cracked
<>Pa1ta1la-Ra1van2a fell down dead. (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>PAT2ALA1VATI1. A holy river of Uttara Bha1rata. (S4loka
<>11, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva)
<HI>PA1T2ALI1PUTRA. An ancient city of Pura1n2ic fame in
<>Uttara Bha1rata. The former name of this city was
<>Pa1t2ali1putraka. There is a story behind the city getting
<>this name:--
<NI>There was once a sacred pond named Kanakhala on
<>the banks of river Gan3ga1. A brahmin from Daks2in2a-
<>bha1rata along with his wife came to this pond and
<>started practising severe austerities there. He got three
<>sons while living there. After some time the parents
<>died. The three sons went to a place named Ra1jagr2ha
<>and studied there. The three were very poor and they
<>went from there to perform penance to propitiate
<>Subrahman2ya (Kuma1rasva1mi1). On their way they
<>entered the house of a brahmin named Bhojika livtng
<>on the sea-coast. Bhojika had three daughters and the
<>brahmin after knowing all details about them gave his
<>daughters in marriage to them along with all his wealth.
<>The brahmin went to perform penance and the three
<>brahmin boys with their wives lived in that house.
<NI>Once there occurred a famine and the three brahmins
<>left their home leaving their wives alone. The second
<>girl was pregnant at that time and she and her sisters
<>went to the house of a friend of their father named
<>Yajn5adatta. In due course she delivered a son and all [Page583-a+ 63]
<>the three women looked after the child as their common
<>son.
<NI>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 were travelling by air once and seeing
<>this child S4iva said thus:--“I am blessing this boy.
<>This boy in his previous birth jointly with his wife
<>worshipped me with great devotion. They are now born
<>again to enjoy life. His wife in his previous birth was
<>born as the daughter of King Mahendra. Her name
<>was Pa1t2ali1 and she would again be the wife of this boy
<>in this life.”
<NI>That night Paramas4iva appeared before the mother of
<>the boy in a dream and said “You must name this boy
<>Putraka. Everyday morning when he rises up a lakh of
<>small gold coins will fall to the ground from his
<>head.”
<NI>They therefore, named the boy Putraka and every
<>morning they would collect and store the gold coins
<>falling from his head. When Putraka grew up he was
<>immensely rich and started giving away his riches to
<>brahmins as gifts. The news of this spread far and wide
<>and brahmins from all sides began to flock to his
<>house.
<NI>One day among the brahmins who flocked to his house
<>were his father and his two brothers. The fathers felt
<>envious of the extraordinary progress in wealth and
<>fame of their son and they cleverly took the son to a
<>lonely place in a temple in the heart of the Vindhya
<>mountains to kill him. After engaging some murderers
<>to kill him they left the place. Putraka bribed
<>the murderers with his costly dresses and ornaments
<>and escaped from there. There was a great storm then
<>and Putraka walked through it. On his way he met the
<>two sons of Maya1sura quarrelling for the three things
<>left over to them by their father. The paternal property
<>consisted of a stick, a pair of sandals and a pot all
<>of which had some strange powers. If you draw on
<>the ground with the stick you will have at that spot
<>anything you desire. If you wear the sandals you can
<>travel in the air. If you dip your hands into the pot
<>you will get plenty of food.
<NI>Putraka immediately hit upon a plan and addressed the
<>quarrelling brothers thus:--“Why do you fight like
<>this? It is better you decide it by a competitive race.
<>He who wins the race should have the right to get the
<>things.” The two brothers agreed to it and leaving the
<>things with Putraka started running. When they had
<>gone a long distance away from the spot, Putraka put
<>on the sandals and taking the stick and pot with him
<>rose into the air. He landed at a city far away from
<>the spot and started living at the house of an old
<>woman. The King of that country had a daughter named
<>Pa1t2ali1. When the old lady described to him the beauty
<>and good qualities of Pa1t2ali1, Putraka wanted to marry
<>her. So at night when everybody in the palace was
<>asleep Putraka put on his sandals and entered the room
<>of Pa1t2ali1 through the windows. Pa1t2ali woke up; she
<>liked Putraka and they were married according to
<>Ga1ndharva rites. Then they both went out of the
<>palace by air with the help of the sandals and landed
<>at a place on the shores of the Gan3ga1. Then at the
<>request of Pa1t2ali1 Putraka made a city there with the
<>help of the stick and they named it Pa1t2ali1putraka.

<HI>PATAN3GA. A mountain. There are twenty small
<>mountains around Maha1meru and Patan3ga is one of
<>them.
<HI>PATAN5JALI. A celebrated commentator in Sanskrit.
<>Patan5jali is one of the best commentators of Pa1n2ini's
<>Vya1karn2asu1tras. Pandits are of opinion that he got his
<>name Patan5jali to mean that people should worship
<>(an5jali) at his foot (pa1da). He was such an adorable
<>person. Pandits believe that Patan5jali is the author of
<>Yogasu1tra and Carakasam3hita1. A few believe that
<>Patan5jali was the incarnation of A1dis4es2a. But modern
<>scholars are of opinion that Patan5jali, the commentator
<>and Patan5jali the author of Yogasu1tras are two different
<>persons.
<NI>In his book on Patan5jalicarita, Ra1mabhadradi1ks2ita
<>writes about the birth of Patan5jali:--“Once
<>Gon2ika1, daughter of a sage, prayed to the Sun-god for
<>a son At once Ananta, King of the serpents, fell on
<>her palm in the form of a sage. The ascetic girl brought
<>up that sage as her son. After some years the sage
<>went to Cidambara and prayed to S4iva to bless him
<>with enough knowledge and wisdom to write a com-
<>mentary on Ka1tya1yana's Vya1karan2ava1rttika (explana-
<>tory rules on Pa1n2in2i's su1tras). S4iva blessed him and the
<>sage wrote the commentary. Many disciples went to
<>him to learn the commentary and the sage accepted
<>them all as disciples and promised to teach them provi-
<>ded they would abide by a condition, namely, that nobody
<>should remove a curtain he would place between him
<>and the disciples while teaching. The teaching went
<>on for some time. He would reply to their doubts
<>but the replies were peculiar and ambiguous and the
<>disciples, getting disappointed, removed the curtain
<>one day. The sage cursed them all. One of the dis-
<>ciples was away from the place then and the sage
<>cursed him for leaving the place without permission
<>during the course of study. He begged for relief and
<>the sage was pleased. The Guru said if he could teach
<>his commentary to one who would say logically that
<>the Bhu1takarmava1cyakr2danta (past participle of a
<>verb) of the root ‘Pac’ was ‘Pakva’ he would be
<>released from the curse. Candragupta who came
<>from Ujjayini1 gave the correct answer and he was
<>taught the Maha1bha1s2ya. Bhartr2hari was the son born
<>to Candragupta of a S4u1dra woman.
<NI>Patan5jali, according to Professor Goldstucker, was a
<>courtier of King Pus2yamitra and was alive when
<>Menander attacked Sa1keta. This would mean that
<>Patan5jali lived before B.C. 150.
<HI>PATANA(S). A company of devils. (Chapter 285,

<HI>PATINET2T2ARAKKAVI(S). (Eighteen and a half wise
<>men).
<NI>Ma1navikrama, the zamorin who ruled the old state of
<>Kozhikkot2u in the beginning of the seventh century
<>(Malaya1lam Era) was a talented man well-versed in
<>all arts. He kept in his court a company of nineteen
<>wise men whom he called by the well-known name
<>Patinet2t2arakkavis meaning eighteen and a half kavis.
<>The kavis of the zamorin were the nine Pat2t2eris of
<>Payyu1r, the five Nambu1tiris of Tiruvegappura,
<>Mullappilly Nambu1tiri, Uddan2d2as4a1stri, Ka1kkas4s4eri
<>Bhat2t2atiri, Cenna1s Nambu1tirippa1d2u and Punam
<>Nambu1tiri. Of these eighteen were scholars in Sanskrit
<>and the nineteenth, Punam Nambu1tiri was a vernacular
<>poet and so the then zamorin gave only half a unit
<>value to the vernacular member and thus named the
<>assemby as a company of eighteen and a half members.
<>There is another explanation given to the word
<>‘arakkavi’. ‘Ara’ means ‘half; but modern pandits say
<>that ‘ara’ was a prefix to show a sign of royalty as is
<>found in the words ‘aramana’ meaning royal mana or
<>palace of the King. S4o ‘arakkavi’ would mean a Kavi
<>attached to a King. Then the question comes, which
<>of the nineteen was not included in the original com-
<>pany to reduce the number to eighteen. We can leave
<>the matter for further research.
<NI>Payyu1r Accan Bhat2t2atirippa1d2u, the top-most of Kerala
<>pandits, was the president of the council of Patinet2t2arak-
<>kavis. The illam (house) of this Bhat2t2atirippa1d2u
<>belonged to the Kunnamkulam taluk near Guruva1yu1r
<>of Cochin state. He was known as Mahars2i also
<>Uddan2d2as4a1strikal in his Mallika1ma1ruta states that one
<>of the Pat2t2eris was Payyu1r Maha1bhat2t2atirippa1d2u named
<>Parames4vara. Uddan2d2as4a1stri belonged to Ka1n5ci1pura.
<>Ka1kkas4s4eri Bhat2t2atiri was born to defeat the invincible
<>Uddan2d2as4a1stri. Cenna1s Nambu1tiri was the author of
<>Tantras2amuccaya. Many poets and pandits were born
<>in the family of these Kavis after their death.
<HI>PATIVRATA1MA1HATMYAPARVA. A subsidiary Parva
<>of Vana Parva of Maha1bha1rata. This comprises six
<>chapters commencing from Chapter 293 of Vana Parva.
<HI>PATRES4VARA. A sacred place. This is situated on the
<>northern shore of river Narmada1. If one bathes in the
<>ti1rtha (pond) there, one will be able to enjoy the
<>company of celestial maidens for five thousand years.
<>(Chapter 17, Padma Pura1n2a)
<HI>PAT2T2ATTA1NA. This was a custom which was in force
<>in the ancient temples of Kerala from the 9th century
<>A.D. Pat2t2a means a ‘Sanskrit pandit’ ‘Pat2t2as’ is used
<>as its plural. To give instructions in s4a1stras and upani-
<>s2ads to the three upper classes and to read in public
<>at fixed times the Pura1n2as, to make people more and
<>more religious minded, it was the custom to appoint
<>Pat2t2as in temples in ancient Kerala. This position which
<>was the loftiest that could be attained by a pandit of
<>those times was called by the name Pat2t2atta1na. From
<>the 9th century A. D. references are found about
<>Pat2t2atta1na in official records. In all important temples
<>a ma1va1ratapat2t2a used to be appointed. His duty was to
<>read and explain Maha1bha1rata to people.
<NI>U1ra1lars who conducted the day to day administration
<>of the temples and the Koiladhika1ri who represented
<>the supreme authority, and the King, jointly granted
<>the Pat2t2atta1na to deserving people. Pandits used to
<>come to temples and engage themselves in religions [Page584-b+ 65]
<>polemics to make themselves worthy of the grant of
<>Pat2t2atta1na. The Pat2t2as were entitled to some profits
<>from the temples. Records of the 3rd century Malaya1lam
<>Era regarding the routine expenditure in the Tiruvalla
<>temple mention about ‘five na1zhis of rice to be given to
<>each of the Pat2t2as within the temple’. Pat2t2as also were
<>given many lands free of tax as were given to U1ra1lars.
<>In the Manalikkara order of 1236 A.D. and the
<>Padmana1bhapura order of 1237 A.D. mention is made
<>about these grants. Pat2t2astha1na and U1ra1ymastha1na
<>became hereditary after some time and began to
<>decline in importance.
<NI>Even the meaning of the word Pat2t2atta1na underwent a
<>change. In Cochin it meant the ceremony of giving
<>feasts followed by money-bags to invited brahmins by
<>the Kings to obtain pun2ya for the dead members of the
<>royal family. The zamorins of Calicut meant by
<>Pat2t2atta1na the act of giving fifty-one bags each con-
<>taining fiftyone rupees to the successful candidates in
<>s4a1stra1rtha contests held at the Tali temple during the
<>period between Revati1 and Tiruva1tira (Ardra1) in the
<>month of Tula1m. There is a difference of opinion
<>regarding the number of money-bags and the amount
<>in each. Ullu1r S. Parames4vara Iyer in his Vijn5a1na-
<>di1pika1 (page 148) states that the number of bags were
<>46 and the money in each was two hundred rupees. Of
<>these, twelve bags each were sanctioned for Pra1bha1kara
<>Mi1ma1m3sa1 and Bha1t2t2ami1ma1m3sa1, nine for Vya1karan2a, and
<>thirteen for Veda1nta. According to certain records 48
<>bags were given in the year 1679 A.D. Contests in
<>Pra1bha1kara Mi1ma1m3sa1 were held on the southern
<>temple-tower gate of the Tali temple and in Vya1karan2a
<>on the southern platform of the northern temple tower
<>gate of the same temple. The custom of giving hund-
<>red and one rupees each to one hundred and eight
<>scholars in S4ri1 Padmana1bhasva1mi1 temple of Trivandrum
<>is also called Pat2t2atta1na.

<>Nambus4a1ri Aran. Pleased at the birth of a son the
<>parents gave a grand feast at the big Payyannu1r plains.
<>At that time the brothers of Ni1lakes4i1 reached the place
<>in a ship. They climbed the fort-walls and tried to [Page588-a+ 65]
<>enter the grounds. Some people objected to it and at that
<>time Nambucetty came there and beat them to death. On
<>hearing about this Ni1lakesi1 left everything behind includ-
<>ing her son and went again on a pilgrimage. When
<>the son grew up the father taught his son everything
<>about trade and ships. The father gave him a new ship
<>for trading and the son taking along with him Pa1n2d2yas,
<>Jonakas, Coliyas, Pa1ppavas and a Yavana and a huge
<>stock of goods put the ship into the sea and fearlessly
<>went for trading. After passing through many ports
<>and crossing another ocean he reached Ponmala (the
<>mountain of gold) and bartered his goods for a heap of
<>gold. He came back to his own land and was one day
<>playing chess with his father when a Sannya1sini1 (female
<>ascetic) came there. When she was given alms she
<>requested to be allowed to talk to the young merchant.
<>The Sannya1sini1 was none other than Ni1lakes4i1 the
<>mother of Nambus4a1ri Aran, the young merchant. She
<>requested him to come to Payyannu1r for a feast conduct-
<>ed by a woman there and he agreed to that. But the
<>father objected to it. But when the son persisted in
<>going, the father sent him with the sons of a cetty, a
<>few people from Man2igra1ma and a huge stock of goods
<>for trade. The poem ends there thus with 104 verses.
<NI>There are different opinions about the story among
<>literary critics and historians. Gundert writes about it
<>thus:--“This is a piece of Malaya1lam work most ancient
<>of all that I have seen. This is a creation in Malaya1-
<>lam before that language became diluted with meaning-
<>less indeclinable Sanskrit words.” According to
<>Gundert this poem was written before the poem
<>Ra1macarita was written and thus in the 3rd century
<>M.E.

<>wide as a fourth part of the area of the pi1t2ha. For a
<>pran2a1la of a S4iva temple the length of the same should
<>be half of that of the Pin2d2ika1.
<NI>The sanctum sanctorum of the temple should be divid-
<>ed into seven divisions and the Pin2d2ika1 should be

<HI>PIN3GALA VII. A ra1ks2asa (demon). Once when this
<>demon was going through a forest he met a forester.
<>The latter got afraid and climbed up a S4ami1 tree. Then

<>Si1ta1 on hearing this cursed Pin2gala1. She said “Oh
<>beautiful woman who has approached my husband
<>with amorous intentions, you will have three bends in
<>your body when you are born next as the servant maid
<>of Kam3sa.” Pin3gala1 weeping bitterly craved for
<>pardon and then Si1ta1 said that Kr2s2n2a would make her
<>perfect. (Vila1sa Ka1n2d2a, A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>PIN3GALARA1JA. A Yaks2a who lives in cremation

<HI>PIN3GATI1RTHA. An ancient holy place. (Chapter 82,
<>Vana Parva.)
<HI>PIN5JALA1. A river of Pura1n2ic fame. The greatness of
<>this river is described in S4loka 27, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma

<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>PIPPALA II. A brahmin born of the race of Kas4yapa.
<>Pippala did severe penance and became arrogant of
<>the power acquired by it. Once he happened to see
<>the eminent sage Sukarma1 serving with devotion his
<>own mother and father and that made his arrogance
<>fade a bit. (Bhu1mi Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>61).
<HI>PIPPALA1DA. An ancient sage belonging to the tradi-
<>tion of preceptors. (See under Guruparampara1). It is
<>said that this sage got that name because he was in the
<>habit of eating Pippali1 in large quantities daily.
<>Pras4nopanis2ad tells a story of how the sages Sukes4a,
<>S4aibya, Satyaka1ma (Kas4yapa), Kaus4alya, Bha1rgava and
<>Kabandhi1 went to Pippala1da seeking A1tmajn5a1na
<>(spiritual knowledge) and how he gave them instruct-
<>ions on the same.
<NI>Padma Pura1n2a gives the following information regard-
<>ing Pippala1da:--“Once Kun2d2ala, a brahmin residing
<>in Kuruks2etra, got a son named Sukarma1. Sukarma1's
<>parents were old and Sukarma1 spent most of his time
<>looking after his sickly aged parents. Kun2d2ala taught
<>his son all the Vedas and S4a1stras. At that time in the
<>gotra of Kas4yapa was born a brahmin named Pippa-
<>la1da. Controlling his senses and abandoning all
<>passions he did severe penance in a forest called
<>Das4a1ran2ya. The greatness of his penance made the
<>animals of the forest leave their mutual enmity and live
<>in perfect peace. Even the devas were astonished at
<>the power of his penance.
<NI>Pippala1da did penance sitting as majestic and motion-
<>less as a mountain for a thousand years. Ants made a
<>sand-heap over him like a mole-hill. The sage sat
<>inside without any motion; poisonous black cobras
<>circled round him and yet the sage made no movement.
<>Three thousand years went by like that and then the
<>devas showered flowers on him. Brahma1 appeared and
<>gave him the boon ‘Sarvaka1masiddhi’ (getting all that
<>is desired) and by the blessing of Brahma1 he became a
<>very learned person also.
<NI>Pippala1da became arrogant with the boon of ‘Sarva-
<>ka1masiddhi’ in his possession. One day while he was
<>sitting on a river-bank a swan appeared before him
<>and in clear tones said:--“Pippala1da, why are you so
<>proud of your greatness? I do not believe you have that [Page590-a+ 64]
<>power of universal attraction. This art is arva1ci1na
<>(modern); you do not know Pra1ci1na because
<>you are illiterate. You take pride unnecessarily
<>for having done penance for three thousand years. Do
<>you know Sukarma1, the wise son of Kun2d2ala? He is
<>the man who has acquired this power of attraction.
<>There is no maha1jn5ani1 (one possessing spiritual know-
<>ledge) like him anywhere else in this world. Sukarma1
<>has given no gifts, he has not practised meditation, he
<>has not performed ya1gas or yajn5as nor has he ever done
<>a pilgrimage. He has not done any of these virtuous
<>deeds and yet he is well-versed in all the s4a1stras and
<>Vedas. Even though he is a child you do not possess
<>enough knowledge to equal his. Why? Because he is
<>always engaged in the care and welfare of his parents.
<>You take pride in your achievements without reason.”
<NI>Hearing that Pippala1da went and met Sukarma1. Pip-
<>pala1da knew that the bird was none other than Brahma1
<>himself. They talked to each other for a long time and
<>then Pippala1da admitted that Sukarma1 was a greater
<>man than himself. (Chapters 60-62, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>PIPPALASTHA1NA. A division of land included in the
<>Jambu1dvi1pa. (S4loka 37, Chapter 6, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PIPPALA1YA. One of the nine sons born to R2s2abhadeva
<>of his wife Jayanti1. Pippa1laya was a very pious king.
<>(4th Skandha, Bha1gavata)
<HI>PIS4A1CA I. (Devil, Satan)
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} A malevolent being which is the very
<>manifestation of evil. Everybody, everywhere in the
<>world, from the very birth of this universe believed in
<>the presence of such a wicked soul. According to Hindu
<>Pura1n2as, Pis4a1ca is a creation of Brahma1. In the begin-
<>ning Brahma1 created the eighteen praja1patis headed by
<>Daks2a, the Yaks2as, the Gandharva and the Pis4a1cas.
<>(Chapter 1, A1di Parva). This wicked being is called
<>in English a ‘Devil’. This word is derived from the
<>Greek word ‘diabolos’. People of the West and East
<>equally believe that Pis4a1ca (Satan) is an enemy of men
<>and gods alike.
<NI>2) {%Bible and the Pis4a1ca.%} It is not clearly stated in Bible
<>how Satan was born but it is being referred to at several
<>places as a wicked soul which leads men to evil.
<NI>3) {%The Bha1rati1ya San3kalpa.%} Pisa1ca, the creation of
<>Brahma1, has taken important roles in the Pura1n2ic
<>stories. Though Pis4a1ca is the instigator of all evils its
<>manifestation appears in many contexts in the Pura1n2as:--
<NI>(i) Pis4a1ca lives in the court of Kubera and worships
<>him. (S4loka 16, Chapter 10, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(ii) Pis4a1ca lives in the court of Brahma1 and worships
<>him. (S4loka 49, Chapter 11, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iii) Pis4a1ca lives in the Gokarn2ati1rtha and worships
<>S4iva. (S4loka 25, Chapter 85. Vana Parva).

<>Parva).
<HI>PIS4A1CA III. An inhabitant of the country of Pis4a1ca in
<>ancient Bha1rata. These Pis4a1cas fought against the
<>Kauravas on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas during the great
<>battle. It was these pis4a1cas that stood on the southern
<>side of the Kraun5cavyu1ha of Yudhis2t2hira in the great
<>battle. (S4loka 50, Chapter 50, Bhi1s2ma Parva). A few
<>of these Pis4a1cas were with Bhagadatta in the army of
<>Duryodhana. (Chapter 87, Bhi1s2ma Parva). S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>cursed the pis4a1cas. Chapter 11, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>PIS4AN3GA. A serpent born of the family of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.

<HI>PITR2(S). Pitr2s are a set of demigods. From Manu-
<>praja1pati, son of Brahma1, were born the Saptars2is like
<>Mari1ci and they in turn created the Pitr2s. Besides
<>Mari1ci and his set many others like Vira1t2 Purus2a and
<>Brahma1 have created Pitr2s. Some Pura1n2as state that
<>Pitr2s are of daily creation. Brahma1 in the beginning
<>created three sets of Pitr2s with form and four with
<>brightness making thus seven sets. The three sets of
<>bodied pitr2s are Agnis2va1ttas, Barhis2adas and Somapa1s
<>and the four bright ones are Yama, Anala, Soma and
<>Aryaman (10th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<>(S4loka 194, Chapter 8, Manusmr2ti).</Poem>
<>Pitr2s (manes) are classified into two types: The Agni-
<>s2va1ttas and Barhis2adas. Of these the Agnis2va1ttas do
<>not perform Ya1gas and the Barhis2adas are those who
<>perform ya1gas. Besides these two major divisions they
<>are classified into many other groups as follows:
<NI>1. {%Somasadasya (s).%} Vira1t2 Purus2a is the creator of these
<>Pitr2s. Somasadasyas are the Pitr2s of Sa1dhyadevas.
<NI>2. {%Agnis2va1tta (s).%} They are the pitr2s of devas.
<NI>3. {%Barhis2adas.%} These Pitr2s are the creation of the sage
<>Atri. They are the manes of daityas, da1navas, yaks2as,
<>gandharvas, uragas (serpents), ra1ks2asas (demons),
<>suvarn2as and kinnaras. [Page591-a+ 64]
<NI>4. {%Somapa1 (s).%} They are the sons of the sage Bhr2gu and
<>are the manes of brahmins.
<NI>5. {%Havirbhuk (s).%} The sage An3giras is the father of
<>these Pitr2s who are the manes of Ks2atriyas.
<NI>6. {%A1jyapa1 (s).%} These are the sons of the sage Pulastya
<>and are the manes of Vais4yas.
<NI>7. {%Suka1lika (s).%} Sons of the sage Vasis2t2ha, these Pitr2s
<>are the manes of the S4u1dras.
<NI>To the seven sages like Mari1ci were born the pitr2s and
<>to the pitr2s were born the deva1suras (devas and asuras)
<>and to the deva1suras were born everything else in this
<>universe, animate and inanimate. (Chapter 3, Manu-
<>smr2ti).
<NI>Performing a S4ra1ddha (offering obsequial oblations
<>to the departed) is just like a yajn5a. The oblations
<>should be offered in either silver or silver cum copper
<>pots. Vis4vadevas are the guardians of the pitr2s. There-
<>fore the oblations should be offered after worshipping
<>the Vis4vadevas first and then the pitr2s and then Vis2n2u.
<>(See under S4ra1ddha).
<HI>PITR2TI1RTHA. The Kumbhi1pa1kanaraka (the hell of
<>Kumbhi1pa1ka) in the land of the manes is called
<>Pitr2ti1rtha. There is a story about this in Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata:
<NI>Once the sage Durva1sas with his body smeared with
<>ashes and wearing sacred berries went to Pitr2loka mut-
<>tering “S4ivas4an3kara sarva1tman s4ri1ma1tar bhuvanes4vari”.
<>The lord of the Pitr2loka received him with respect and
<>worshipped him. While they were talking, Durva1sas
<>heard cries of agnoy from somewhere and the sage
<>then asked Pitr2na1tha thus: “Oh lord of the Pitr2s, I
<>have heard you described as a very virtuous man. How
<>can then such painful cries of distress be heard from
<>here? “Oh, I am dying beaten”, “Oh, I am being killed”
<>“Oh, I am dying” and “Oh, I am being burnt” are
<>some of the woeful shrieks I hear. What is the reason
<>for this?”
<NI>Hearing this Dharmara1ja said: “Great sage, this is in
<>fact a land of virtue. Nothing but righteous things are
<>done here. I can tell you from where you hear that
<>wail. The Yamapuri1 named Sam3yamani1 is nearby.
<>There Yama sits to punish the sinners. Yama is a
<>dispenser of Justice and he has got several cruel and
<>mighty servants to carry out his orders. There are
<>eighty-six hells to punish the sinners and of these Kum-
<>bhi1pa1ka is the most horrible. Great sinners like those
<>who insult the gods, fornicators and those who insult
<>their parents are put in this hell and punished. You
<>are now hearing the cries of such sinners from that
<>hell.”
<NI>Durva1sas was curious to see the hell and the lord of
<>the Manes gave permission and asked his servants to
<>show Durva1sas the Kumbhi1pa1kanaraka. The hell was
<>found to change into a heaven. The residents were
<>laughing, singing dancing and doing such acts of
<>happiness.
<NI>The servants of Yama were astonished and they went
<>and reported to Yamara1ja this sudden change. Yamara1ja
<>was also amazed to hear the news. He immediately
<>rode on his vehicle, the buffalo, to the hell to learn the
<>details personally. He could not find out the cause for
<>the change. The place looked like the Svargaloka of
<>Indra. King Yama sent a messenger to Indra with the
<>news and Indra at first thought that it must be due to [Page591-b+ 64]
<>some ma1ya1 and so came to the place swiftly on
<>his Aira1vata. The news spread and one by one Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u, the As2t2adikpa1lakas (the eight guardians of the
<>quarters) and all such people came to Kumbhi1pa1ka-
<>naraka. Nobody could find an explanation for this
<>change and so Maha1vis2n2u accompanied by a few devas
<>went to Kaila1sa and reported the matter to S4iva and
<>S4iva said smilingly “Oh Vis2n2u, all this happened
<>because of the greatness of the holy ashes. When the
<>sage Durva1sas bent down to have a good look at the
<>hell, particles of ashes from his body fell into the hell.
<>From that moment onwards Kumbhi1pa1kanaraka be-
<>came a holy place for the Manes. This hell will hence-
<>forth be known as Pitr2ti1rtha and those pitr2s who bathe
<>in the holy pond there will become virtuous people.
<>Do install on the shore of this pond an idol of mine,
<>a S4ivalin3ga, and by my side the idol of Uma1, which is
<>my power in an embodied form.” The devas returned
<>and did as they were directed.

<>Chapter 117, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>PRABHA1VATI1 III. A female follower of Subrahman2ya.
<>(S4loka 3, Chapter 46, S4al a Parva).
<HI>PRABHA1VATI1 IV. Wife of Citraratha, king of An3ga.
<>This Prabha1vati1 was the eldest sister of Ruci, wife of
<>Devas4arma1. (S4loka 8, Chapter 42, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>PRABHA1VATI1 V. Daughter of the demon Vajrana1bha.
<>She was married to Pradyumna, son of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>There was once a very valiant demon called Vajrana1bha.
<>He went into the valley of Meru and performed penance
<>to propitiate Brahma1. Brahma1 appeared before him
<>and he got from him boons such as strength to conquer
<>and subdue all kings, the secret of leaving the body
<>and entering that of others etc. Empowered with these
<>boons he made Vajrana1bhapura his capital. He got a
<>daughter named Prabha1vati1. His brother Suna1bha had
<>two daughters named Candramati1 and Gun2avati1.
<NI>While he was thus living there, he set out on a campaign
<>of victory. He conquered the whole world and then
<>turned his eyes towards Svarga. Going to Indraloka he
<>told thus: “Hi, son of Kas4yapa, I am also born of
<>Kas4yapa. Your mother Aditi and my mother Diti are
<>both wives of Kas4yapapraja1pati. You ruled over Svarga
<>till this time. Now, let me rule over it for some time.”
<>Indra was embarrassed by this logical challenge and could
<>not give any reply to him. Kas4yapapraja1pati was then
<>performing a long Ya1ga and Indra replied he would find
<>a solution to his demand when their father returned
<>after the Ya1ga. From that moment onwards Indra
<>started thinking of plans to destroy Vajrana1bha. He went
<>and sought help from S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a residing in Dva1raka1.
<>Krsna promised to help him when the time came. [Page593-a+ 64]
<>After returning to Devaloka, Indra started planning to
<>kill Vajrana1bha. Vajrana1bhapuri1 was surrounded by sky-
<>scraping fortresses and admission inside was restricted.
<>He, therefore, called the gaily loitering swans of Deva-
<>loka to his side and told them thus: “Look here, swan--
<>ladies. You should go to Vajrana1bhapuri1 and see
<>Prabha1vati1 and then describe to her the beauty and
<>goodness of Pradyumna. Your description should be
<>such that Prabha1vati1 should fall in love with Pradyumna.
<>After that you should go to Pradyumna and tell him
<>about Prabha1vati1 in a similar way. On completing your
<>mission you should come and report to me.”
<NI>Obeying the orders of Indra the swans flew to Vajra-
<>na1bhapuri1. They saw Prabha1vati1 in a secluded spot and
<>told her just what they were asked to tell her. Then they
<>flew to the side of Pradyumna and told him about
<>Prabha1vati1. After successfully completing their mission
<>they flew to Devaloka. The marriage day of Prabha1-
<>vati1 drew near. The swans went to Prabha1vati1 again
<>and made her request her father to include the per-
<>formances of a dramatic troupe also in the programme
<>of marriage festivities. Vajrana1bha agreed and a troupe
<>was invited. The dramatic troupe comprised among
<>others many Ya1dava soldiers, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Pradyumna
<>and his brothers, all in disguise. Their drama was Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a. The performance was superb and even Vajrana1bha
<>stood amazed at their skill. The troupe was encamped in
<>another palace and treated as royal guests. The compa-
<>nion maid of Prabha1vati1, Su1ci1mukhi1, united her with
<>Pradyumna during the dark hours of the night and they
<>spent the nights in amorous sports. The daughters of
<>Vajrana1bha's brother, Candravati1 and Gun2avati1 came
<>to know of these secret meetings and they requested
<>Prabha1vati1 to find out suitable persons among the Ya1-
<>davas for them also to enjoy with. Prabha1vati1 intro-
<>duced them to Gada and Sa1mba both sons of Kr2s2n2a.
<>The amorous sports of all of them continued freely
<>during the nights.
<NI>When things progressed so far, Indra and Kr2s2n2a persuaded
<>Pradyumna to kill Vajrana1bha. Pradyumna started a
<>war with Vajrana1bha and in the great battle that en-
<>sued Pradyumna killed Vajrana1bha. Pradyumna and
<>his brothers then took the demon girls to Dva1raka1.
<>Pradyumna, Gada and Sa1mba married Prabha1vati1,
<>Candravati1 and Gun2avati1 respectively. By this time
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati returned to Devaloka after his long
<>ya1ga. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Chapters 91 to 95).
<HI>PRABHU. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 69,

<>the race of Agni became the wife of Havirdha1na She
<>got of Havirdha1na six sons named Pra1ci1nabarhis, S4ukra,
<>Gaya, Kr2s2n2a Vraja and Ajina. (Chapter 14, Am3s4a 1,

<>born of the family of Agni became the wife of Havir-
<>dha1na and they got six sons named Pra1ci1nabarhis,
<>S4ukra, Gaya, Kr2s2n2a, Vraja and Ajina. Of these Pra1ci1na-
<>barhis became a great Praja1pati. He carpetted the world
<>with darbha grass with its head turned towards the
<>east and thus got the name (Pra1ci1 = east; barhis = bed
<>of Kus4a grass) Pra1ci1nabarhis. He performed great
<>penance and married Savarn2a1, daughter of the oceans.
<>They got ten sons who were called Pracetases and who were
<>all masters of dhanurveda (archery). They all perform-
<>ed penance for ten thousand years lying submerged
<>in water. Brahma1 persuaded Pra1ci1nabarhis to request
<>his sons to refrain from remaining unmarried. Pra1ci1na-
<>barhis informed his sons about Brahma1's wish. They
<>sat in meditation in the ocean for ten thousand years
<>as per directions from their father and sang songs in
<>praise of Vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u was pleased and he gave
<>dars4ana (vision of god) to them on the surface of the
<>ocean itself with the brilliance of blue lotus. Pracetases
<>went into ecstasy when they saw Bhagava1n coming to
<>them riding on the back of Garud2a and they bowed
<>down in great devotion before him. Maha1vis2n2u asked
<>them what they wanted and they reported they wanted
<>a boon for the progress and prosperity of the praja1s.
<>Granting them the boon Maha1vis2n2u disappeared
<>and the Pracetases went back to their father. (Chapter
<>14, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).

<>Ks2emaka alias S4unaka father of Pradyota was killed by
<>Mlecchas (a barbarous tribe). To avenge the death of
<>his father Pradyota under the advice of Na1rada decided
<>to conduct a Mleccha Yajn5a and for that purpose dug a
<>Yajn5akun2d2a seventeen miles long and seventeen miles
<>wide. The Yajn5a started and in that Yajn3a different

<>onwards Pradyumna got the name ‘Mlecchahanta1’
<>(killer of Mlecchas). (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<HI>PRADYUMNA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A son born to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of his
<>wife Rukmin2i1, Pradyumna was the rebirth of Ka1ma-
<>deva. (For genealogy see under Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} It was at the time when Ka1madeva and
<>Ratidevi1 were living together that Pa1rvati1, daughter of
<>Himava1n, started her penance to get S4iva as her hus-
<>band. It was a need of the devas to get a son of S4iva to
<>kill the fierce demon Ta1raka1sura. The devas employed
<>Ka1madeva to create feelings of love in the ascetic S4iva
<>and make him marry Pa1rvati1. Taking instructions from
<>Indra, Ka1madeva took aim at S4iva with his bow and
<>arrow. S4iva was then in deep meditation and Ka1ma-
<>deva broke his concentration and S4iva got angry. He
<>opened his third eye and burnt Ka1madeva to death.
<NI>Griefstricken by the death of her husband Ratidevi1 per-
<>formed penance near the Hima1layas to propitiate
<>Maha1devi1. Maha1devi1 appeared before her and consoled
<>her thus: “Little girl, Ka1madeva would be reborn as
<>the son of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of Rukmin2i1. He would then be
<>named Pradyumna. The devas have cursed S4ambara
<>the leader of the asuras, during the battle between the
<>demons and the demi-gods that he (S4ambara) would be
<>killed by Pradyumna. So S4ambara is now searching
<>for the infant which is a rebirth of Ka1madeva. So you
<>abandon your present body and be born again as Ma1ya1-
<>vati1 to be the wife of S4ambara. Pradyumna, the re-
<>born Ka1madeva, would kill S4ambara and accept you as
<>his wife.” Devi1 disappeared after saying this.
<NI>Obeying the instructions of Maha1devi1, Rati abandoned
<>her life and was born in the world of asuras. She grew
<>up under the name Ma1ya1vati1 and became the wife
<>of S4ambara.
<NI>While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was living as the chief of Dva1raka1 his
<>first wife Rukmin2i1 was yearning for a child. Kr2s2n2a was
<>deeply moved by the grief of Rukmin2i1 and he flew on
<>the back of Garud2a to Kaila1sa to obtain a boon for the
<>birth of a child for her. On the way he alighted in the
<>a1s4rama of Narana1ra1yan2as and after obtaining the bless-
<>ings of the sages there, went to Kaila1sa and bowed
<>before S4iva and explained to him the purpose of his
<>visit. S4iva blessed him and said that Ka1madeva who
<>was burnt to death by the fire of his third eye would
<>take birth again as the son of Rukmin2i1. Kr2s2n2a returned
<>to Dva1raka1 well-pleased. Rukmin2i1 became pregnant
<>and gave birth to Pradyumna, a rebirth of Ka1madeva.
<>The demon S4ambara knew of this birth and coming to
<>Dva1raka1 in an invisible form carried away the infant
<>when it was seven days old.
<NI>The demon threw the child into the ocean and a great
<>fish swallowed it. The fishermen of the country of
<>S4ambara caught this fish and following the custom pre-
<>valent there presented the king with the fish. S4ambara
<>called his wife Ma1ya1vati1 and asked her to take the fish [Page594-b+ 64]
<>and get it cooked. When Ma1ya1vati1 cut open the fish for
<>cooking she found to her surprise a beautiful child in-
<>side it. Even from the first sight of the child Ma1ya1vati1
<>had a great liking for it and so she took the child and
<>brought it up as her own child.
<NI>When Pradyumna grew into a youth all the charm
<>and beauty of Ka1madeva were found in him. Ma1ya1vati1
<>was excited to find a resemblance in him of her lost
<>husband Ka1madeva. One day the great sage Na1rada
<>came that way and calling Ma1ya1vati1 to his side secretly
<>revealed to her that Pradyumna was the incarnation of
<>Ka1madeva and was thus her lost husband. From that
<>day onwards Ma1ya1vati1's affection for him changed into
<>one of love. She taught him all the magic and witch-
<>craft of S4ambara. When Pradyumna found that Ma1ya1-
<>vati1's affection for him was gradually changing into one
<>of passionate love he questioned her about it. Ma1ya1vati1
<>then told him everything that happened and Pra-
<>dyumna decided to kill S4ambara and take Ma1ya1vati1
<>away.
<NI>3) {%War with S4ambara.%} Pradyumna waited for an
<>opportunity to kill S4ambara. One day Pradyumna went
<>under the flagstaff of S4ambara which flew the royal flag
<>of the king with an emblem of the figure of a lion em-
<>bossed on it. He dropped it down by one stroke of his
<>arrow. Hearing of this S4ambara ordered his sons to kill
<>Pradyumna. The eleven sons of S4ambara, viz., Atisena,
<>Citrasena, Vis2vaksena, S4rutasena, Sus2en2a, Somasena,
<>A1kka1la, Vikala, Kumbhaketu, Sudam3s2t2ra and Kes4i1,
<>attacked Pradyumna. The devas came in their vima1nas
<>and joined sides with Pradyumna. The army of the
<>demons teased him with various kinds of weapons like
<>javelins, arrows, spears and battle axes. But Pra-
<>dyumna cut them all by his arrows and cut to pieces all
<>the sons of S4ambara. Then S4ambara sent an army
<>against him. They were also made to flee by the arrows
<>of Pradyumna. Then S4ambara himself came on the
<>scene. The fight became horrible. The continuous flow
<>of arrows made it impossible for even Sun's rays to
<>reach the earth. Then S4ambara started his magical war.
<>But Pradyumna faced that also. S4ambara sent phantom
<>lions; but Pradyumna made them immobile. S4ambara
<>then in turn created storms, rains, wild animals, ser-
<>pents and vultures. All of them were killed by Pradyu-
<>mna. Then with a well-aimed arrow Pradyumna killed
<>S4ambara. Then he rushed to Dva1raka1 carrying Ma1ya1-

<>to see them. Pradyumna went to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Ruk-
<>min2i1 and told them the whole story. They were over-

<NI>3) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapapraja1pati got of his wife Diti two
<>sons named Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2yakas4ipu and a
<>daughter named Sim3hika1. Of these two, Hiran2ya1ks2a got
<>boons from Brahma1 and roamed about as a very valiant
<>hero destroying everything on earth and finally pulling
<>down the earth to the depths of the ocean. Maha1vis2n2u
<>then incarnated as Vara1ha and after killing Hiran2ya1-
<>ks2a lifted the earth from the ocean and put it in its
<>original position.
<NI>Hiran2yakas4ipu became very angry at Maha1vis2n2u for
<>killing his brother and with a view to wreaking
<>vengeance on him performed penance to propitiate
<>Brahma1. When the emperor of the demons, Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu, thus went to the forests for performing penance
<>the Devas attacked the land of the demons. A great
<>fight ensued in which the devas were defeated. While
<>fleeing away thus Indra took away Kaya1dhu1 wife of
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu by force. Na1rada who heard the
<>moanings of the poor woman under the clutches of
<>Indra got her released from Indra's hold. For some
<>time she stayed in the a1s4rama of Na1rada worshipping
<>him. Kaya1dhu1 was pregnant then. Na1rada taught the
<>child in Kaya1dhu1's womb lessons in Vedas, moral
<>philosophy, duty and spiritual knowledge. When
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu returned after his penance Kaya1dhu1
<>joined him and very soon gave birth to a son. That boy
<>was Prahla1da.
<NI>Hiran2yakas4ipu begot of Kaya1dhu1 five sons, Prahla1da,
<>Sam3hla1da, Anuhla1da, S4ibi and Ba1s2kala. Prahla1da got
<>three sons named Virocana, Kumbha and Nikumbha.
<>The celebrated emperor Maha1bali was the son of
<>Virocana. Ba1n2a was the son of Maha1bali. Us2a1,
<>daughter of Ba1n2a, was married to Aniruddha, son of
<>Pradyumna and grandson of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Chapter 65,
<>A1di Parva; Chapter 19, Agni Pura1n2a; Chapter 15,
<>Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a and 7th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Boyhood and education.%} Hiran2yakas4ipu decided to
<>make Prahla1da an instrument to wreak vengeance on
<>Maha1vis2n2u. Entrusting the education of his son to [Page596-a+ 65]
<>able preceptors he instructed that the boy should never
<>mutter ‘Na1ra1yan2a1ya namah2’ but should on the other
<>hand mutter ‘Hiran2ya1ya namah2’ only. Not only that,
<>he wiped out the name of Na1ra1yan2a from the land
<>altogether. Prahla1da stayed in the house of the
<>preceptor and studied his lessons. One day Prahla1da
<>went to see his father along with his preceptor. Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu was drunk then. Prahla1da went and prostrated
<>before his father and Hiran2yakas4ipu lifting the boy up
<>from the ground asked him with affection to repeat to
<>him all the good things he had learned so far and
<>Prahla1da quickly repeated thus:--“I bow down to
<>Maha1vis2n2u, the root cause of all things seen and unseen,
<>the protector of this visible universe, who is without
<>beginning, centre and end and who is without origin,
<>growth and decay.”
<NI>The words of Prahla1da struck his father like a thunder-
<>bolt. With his lips trembling with anger Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>stared with his blood-red eyes at the preceptor. The
<>frightened Guru again and again submitted that he had
<>never taught him any of the kind the boy had repeated
<>before his father. Then who must have taught him those
<>things? the emperor enquired. Then Prahla1da said
<>that all those things were put into his mind by Maha1-
<>vis2n2u himself. A hot discussion then took place between
<>Prahla1da and his father and in the end Hiran2yakas4i1pu
<>ordered the preceptor to take away Prahla1da and make
<>another earnest attempt to correct him and bring him
<>round to the emperor's liking. Prahla1da stayed for ano-
<>ther period with the Guru serving him with devotion
<>and studying well. After a long time Prahla1da was
<>again taken before his father and the latter as before
<>asked him to repeat what he had studied so far. To the
<>shocking disappointment of Hiran2yakas4ipu Prahla1da
<>again repeated verses in praise of Maha1vis2n2u. The emp-
<>eror's rage knew no bounds and he ordered his men to
<>kill his son. (Chapter 17, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Torturing Prahla1da.%} On hearing the order of Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu many armed soldiers surrounded Prahla1da.
<>Prahla1da addressed them thus: “Oh daityas, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u resides in your weapons, in you all and in me also.
<>Since that is the real truth your weapons will not in-
<>jure me.” The daityas struck him hard with their wea-
<>pons but Prahla1da did not feel pain at all.
<NI>Hiran2yakas4ipu then sent thousands of poisonous ser-
<>pents led by great ones like Taks2aka. When they started
<>thrusting their venomous fangs into his body, Prahla1da
<>stood cheerfully meditating on Maha1vis2n2u and he did
<>not even feel the bitings. On the other hand the fangs
<>of the serpents dropped out from their mouths and the
<>gems on the heads of the big ones burst out and all the
<>snakes felt sorry for their action.
<NI>Hiran2yakas4ipu then sent the as2t2adiggajas (the eight
<>elephants who bear the burden of this earth) to kill
<>Prahla1da. The huge animals bigger than the biggest of
<>mountains threw the boy to the ground and struck him
<>with their long and pointed tusks. Prahla1da lay medi-
<>tating on Maha1vis2n2u and the tusks that hit the body of
<>Prahla1da were broken to bits. Prahla1da was then
<>thrown into a pit of fire. But the wind-blown ferocious
<>fire was not able to burn him and as he lay in the fire-
<>pit meditating on Maha1vis2n2u he felt he was lying on a
<>bed of lotuses.
<NI>When things progressed so far the astonished priests of
<>the palace advised the emperor to put a stop to tortur- [Page596-b+ 65]
<>ing Prahla1da. Their consoling words alleviated his rage
<>and he sent Prahla1da again to his Guru for another
<>term of study. He stayed with his Guru and continued
<>his studies. Whenever he got leisure he taught the other
<>inmates of the a1s4rama lessons in Vis2n2uma1rga. Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu was informed of this and obeying orders from him
<>the asuras gave poison to Prahla1da. That too was of no
<>avail. The royal priests got angry and they created a
<>devil as ferocious as the flames of fire. The devil with
<>mighty thumpings on earth dashed towards Prahla1da
<>and hit him on his breast with its spike. The spike
<>broke into pieces and the devil turning back cursed the
<>priests. Then the daityara1ja took him to the top of a
<>mountain twentyfour miles high and pushed him down
<>from there. The boy fell down meditating on Maha1-
<>vis2n2u and the goddess of earth received him with ex-
<>tended hands and prevented a painful impact with the
<>ground. The father became furious and sent S4ambara1-
<>sura to kill his son. S4ambara tried many magical attacks.
<>Prahla1da without any ill-feeling towards S4ambara
<>sat meditating on Maha1vis2n2u and then Vis2n2u sent his
<>Sudars4ana wheel against the demon and he was forced
<>to retreat. Then by orders from Hiran2yakas4ipu the wind
<>god entered the body of Prahla1da. Prahla1da knew it
<>and he sat meditating on Vis2n2u and the latter entering
<>the body of Prahla1da drank the wind inside him. When
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu was defeated in all his attempts to kill
<>Prahla1da he sent his son again to his Guru. Then the
<>preceptor taught him everything that was needed for a
<>king and also the science of justice written by S4ukra1-
<>ca1rya. When Prahla1da completed his education and the
<>Guru felt the boy had become humble he took him back
<>to Hiran2yakas4ipu.
<NI>Once again Hiran2yakas4ipu entered into a discussion on
<>god with his son and dissatisfied with his continued de-
<>votion to Vis2n2u decided again to kill his son. He was
<>thrown into the ocean bound hand and foot. With every
<>movement of Prahla1da the ocean became turbulent
<>and water rose on all sides. There was a deluge on
<>earth. Hiran2yakas4ipu called the daityas to his side and
<>said: “Oh daityas, bring all the mountains on earth
<>and create a barrier round the ocean so that my wicked
<>son cannot get outside the ocean. Fire does not kill
<>this boy; he is not wounded by any of the weapons;
<>wind, poison, devils, magic, falls from heights and even
<>the diggajas could not kill him. So let him remain in
<>water for thousands of years together and then he
<>will die.”
<NI>The daityas and da1navas brought mountains and drop-
<>ped them over Prahla1da lying inside the ocean. The
<>mountains lay spread over thousands of miles. Lying
<>thus in the ocean the pious boy prayed to Maha1vis2n2u
<>and the latter appeared before him and granted him
<>boons. Escaping from the ocean Prahla1da went to his
<>father and prostrated before him. Hiran2yakas4ipu was
<>astounded to see him alive and taking him in his arms
<>embraced him and with tears rolling down his cheeks
<>for having tortured him so far asked him “My son, you
<>are still alive, are you not?” After that he started treat-
<>ing him as his son. (Chapter 20, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%The incarnation of Narasim3ha.%} But as days went by
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu got wild again. He could not bear his
<>son's increasing devotion to Vis2n2u. He hated to hear
<>Prahla1da's chantings of Vis2n2u's name and so one dar [Page597-a+ 65]
<>while Prahla1da was repeating his chantings of Vis2n2u's
<>name Hiran2yakas4ipu {??}umped up from his seat with
<>sword in his hand and asked Prahla1da where his Vis2n2u
<>was. Prahla1da very calmly replied that Vis2n2u was pre-
<>sent everywhere even in stones, trees or the pillars of
<>the palace. Hiran2yakas4ipu in uncontrollable rage struck
<>the nearest pillar with his sword. Then to the shock-
<>ing surprise of Hiran2yakas4ipu Maha1vis2n2u in the form of
<>a fierce man-lion (Narasim3ha) jumped out from the
<>pillar. The figure was terrifying to look at. It had fiery
<>eyes, a dagger-like tongue with blood oozing from it,
<>shaggy neck with trembling eyebrows, two teeth one
<>on each side curved like the crescent moon, a black face
<>inside a cave-like heap of manes, hairs strong and point-
<>ed like diamond needles, nails white and cup-like and
<>a body as bright and brilliant as a thousand crores of
<>suns. Only Prahla1da could stand before the figure and
<>look at it.
<NI>The man-lion jumped on the body of Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>and tearing open the belly of Hiran2yakas4ipu took the
<>bloody intestines out and wearing it round its neck
<>performed a naked dance. Everything happened in no
<>time and the Narasim3ha changing into the form of
<>Maha1vis2n2u blessed Prahla1da and then disappeared.
<>(7th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>7) {%Prahla1da and Narana1ra1yan2as.%} When Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>was killed Prahla1da was crowned as emperor of the
<>demons in Pa1ta1la. At that time, once Cyavana the best of
<>the Bhr2gus, went to Na1gakules4varati1rtha to bathe in the
<>Narmada1. He saw Maha1deva there. When he entered
<>the waters of the river a serpent Kekaralohita by name
<>bit him and took him to Pa1ta1la. Cyavana meditated on
<>Vis2n2u when he was bitten by the serpent and so he was
<>not affected by the poison of the serpent. He therefore,
<>roamed about in Pa1ta1la accepting the hospitality of the
<>serpent maidens. Travelling thus he reached the land
<>of the da1navas. He was worshipped by the daityas there
<>and Prahla1da finding an ascetic of great saintliness hon-
<>oured and worshipped by his people received him with
<>respect and worshipped him and enquired about him.
<>Cyavana said: “I came today to see Na1gakules4vara
<>and bathe in the Narmada1 river. But as soon as I en-
<>tered the river I was caught by a serpent and was
<>brought to Pa1ta1la. I was thus able to see you.” Hearing
<>the words of Cyavana the lord of the daityas said: “Oh,
<>Bhagavan, which are all the sacred ti1rthas of the earth,
<>which are in the heavens and which all in Pa1ta1la?
<>Please do enlighten us.” Cyavana replied; “Mighty
<>king, Naimis2a is the best of all ti1rthas on earth, Pus2kara
<>in the heavens and Cakrati1rtha in Pa1ta1la.”
<NI>The daitya emperor turned to the da1navas and said
<>“Make all preparations immediately. We must go to
<>earth to bathe in the holy ti1rtha, Naimis2a. We can then
<>see Pun2d2ari1ka1ks2a (lotus-eyed) Vis2n2u sitting there as
<>Pi1ta1mbara (robed in yellow).” Hearing this da1navas
<>with heavy equipments started from Pa1ta1la with their
<>king to the earth.
<NI>All the mighty da1navas reached the forest of Naimis2a
<>and after bathing in the holy pond there went for hunt-
<>ing. During their wanderings they found the river Sar-
<>asvati1, flowing with crystal-like water. On the shore of
<>the same they saw a pine tree covered with arrows. The
<>arrows were sticking to it one above another. The arr-
<>ows looked like serpents and the gruesome sight roused
<>Prahla1da's anger. Near that tree sat two ascetics wear- [Page597-b+ 65]
<>ing the hide of Kr2s2n2a deer and matted hair on thei
<>heads. By their side were two divine bows, S4a1rn3ga and
<>Ajagava with two never-empty quivers. Prahla1da mis-
<>took them for two fake sannya1sins and therefore question-
<>ed them thus: “Why are you thus falsely trading on
<>virtuousness? What connection is there between matted
<>hair and penance and weapons of such supreme qual-
<>ity?” Then one of the r2s2is, Narars2i, said “King of dait-
<>yas, why do you think like that? If one is powerful
<>whatever one does will be right.” Prahla1da jeered and said
<>“When I, who have fixed limits for virtue and righte-
<>ousness, am here what power can you wield?” Nara
<>replied “Oh king, our ability is really supreme. There
<>is nobody in the three worlds to conquer us in a fight.”
<>Prahla1da got furious on hearing the boasting of the r2s2i
<>and took a vow thus immediately: “I will fight and
<>win against Narana1ra1yan2as.” Then the great Prah-
<>la1da keeping aside his army in the forest took his bow
<>and made a thundering noise with it.
<NI>At once Nara took his Ajagava bow and showered arr-
<>ows on Prahla1da with it. But Prahla1da broke them all
<>with his gold-plated matchless arrows. Nara got angry
<>when he found all his arrows broken to pieces so easily
<>by Prahla1da and he sent different kinds of arrows in
<>quick succession. But the daitya king replied with aston-
<>ishing rapidity. For one arrow of Nara the daitya sent
<>two and the fight became grim. Nara covered the whole
<>world above with arrows and the daitya emperor smash-
<>ed them all to pieces by his gold-plated ones.
<NI>The fight then turned to one with divine weapons. The
<>asura chief took the divine Brahma1stra and then Nara
<>took the fierce Na1ra1yan2a1stra. They met in the air and
<>fell down powerless. When his Brahma1stra got fused
<>Prahla1da got wild with anger and taking a mace jump-
<>ed out of his chariot and rushed at Nara. When Na1ra1-
<>yan2a saw the daitya chief rushing towards Nara with
<>his mace he asked Nara to step aside and faced the
<>demon himself. Prahla1da then attacked Na1ra1yan2a and
<>hit him with the mace. But the mace broke into a hun-
<>dred pieces and Prahla1da was forced to use other wea-
<>pons. The fight became ghastly and even devas assem-
<>bled above to witness the fight. When Prahla1da found
<>it was getting more and more difficult for him to defeat
<>the Narana1ra1yan2as he prayed to Maha1vis2n2u for help.
<>Vis2n2u appeared before him and when Prahla1da asked
<>him the reason why he could not defeat Narana1ra1yan2as,
<>Vis2n2u replied that they were the sons of Dharmadeva
<>who were invincible by weapons. They could be won
<>over only by devotion.
<NI>Hearing that Prahla1da returned to Pa1ta1la and entrust-

<>Andhaka, son of Hiran2ya1ks2a, Prahla1da returned to

<>penance to propitiate Narana1ra1yan2as. When Nara-
<>na1ra1yan2as appeared before him Prahla1da requested to
<>be pardoned for fighting against them. They pardoned
<>him and blessed him and Prahla1da returned to Pa1ta1la.
<>Even after his return Prahla1da did not take back the

<>land and took refuge under their preceptor S4ukra1ca1rya.
<>S4ukra then told them thus: “You remain here without

<>advantage. It is enough if you remain here with full con-

<>daityas awaited the return of their a1ca1rya. In the mean-
<>time they sent Prahla1da who was, though a daitya, a
<>friend of the devas to talk peace terms with the devas.
<>The mission was successful and the devas agreed to a
<>no-war treaty. Prahla1da returned triumphant.
<NI>S4ukra did severe penance to propitiate S4iva and S4iva
<>appeared before S4ukra1ca1rya and when he knew that
<>the purpose of S4ukra was to defeat the devas he was
<>a bit embarrassed. So he told him thus: “Oh sage
<>S4ukra, you take a vow and do penance with your head
<>downwards over smoky incense for a thousand years.
<>You will then attain power and happiness as you
<>desire.” In fact S4iva thought S4ukra might not be able
<>to complete the penance and so not succeed in his plan
<>of destroying the devas. But S4ukra started the penance
<>in right earnest.
<NI>The devas were frightened when they knew the deceit
<>of the daityas and the strategy of their preceptor. They
<>decided to go to war with the daityas immediately. The
<>daityas were in a fix. They knew that if they fought
<>without the help of their guru defeat to them was sure.
<>So they ran to the mother of S4ukra and sought her help.
<>The devas rebelled against S4ukra's mother and she in-
<>voked the goddess of sleep and put all the devas into
<>deep slumber. Maha1vis2n2u stealthily carried away Indra
<>lying asleep. Indra persuaded Maha1vis2n2u. to kill S4ukra's
<>mother and he cut off the head of S4ukra's mother by
<>the divine discus, Sudars4ana.
<NI>Bhr2gumahars2i, father of S4ukra, was angry at that
<>arrogant and cruel deed of Maha1vis2n2u and cursed him
<>saying that he would be born on earth several times as
<>man. After that he brought to life by sprinkling water
<>his wife lying dead with her head severed from her body.
<>Knowing well the havoc that would be created
<>when S4ukra came back after his penance Indra
<>sent his daughter Jayanti1 to destroy the penance of
<>S4ukra. She went in the guise of a demon girl to serve
<>S4ukra1ca1rya. In the meantime at the request of Indra
<>Br2haspati took the form of S4ukra1ca1rya and presented [Page598-b+ 64]
<>himself before the daityas. The daityas believed him to
<>be their real guru S4ukra and were pleased.
<NI>Ten years went by and one day S4ukra1ca1rya remember-
<>ing the old events left Jayanti1 and went to his court
<>in the demon land. Br2haspati had by that time returned
<>to devaloka fully satisfied with his mission. The devas
<>not knowing that S4ukra had returned started for a war
<>with the daityas. S4ukra when he came back went wild
<>when he knew that his people had been worshipping
<>Br2haspati for ten years. The angered preceptor was not
<>to be pacified by any amount of arguments and so they
<>sent Prahla1da to S4ukra1ca1rya and Prahla1da pleaded for
<>controlling his anger and S4ukra did so.
<NI>S4ukra then saw with his divine vision the maneuverings
<>in mind of the devas and was convinced that a war with
<>the devas at that juncture would be an utter failure. So
<>he advised the daityas to desist from war and assured
<>them that during the period of Sa1varn2i Manu to come,
<>emperor Bali would become all-powerful and he would
<>then fight and win the devas. Prahla1da returned and
<>told the asuras the message of S4ukra1ca1rya. But the
<>daityas were not satisfied and compelled Prahla1da to go
<>to war with the devas. At last Prahla1da was forced
<>to agree and a fierce deva1sura battle ensued. Prah-
<>la1da met Indra in a single combat and it prolonged for
<>a hundred years. In the end Prahla1da won. Indra
<>prayed to the goddess and fearing that she might des-
<>troy the demon world, Prahla1da also prayed to her.
<>The devi1 was pleased with both of them and she paci-
<>fied them both and each went back to his own place.

<HI>PRA1KR2TA. A Yaks2a. He became very rich within
<>twelve days. (S4loka 19, Chapter 134, Vana Parva).
<HI>PRAKR2TI; PURUS2A. Prakr2ti (matter) and Purus2a
<>(spirit) are two basic factors essential for production of
<>the Prapan5ca (the visible world which is the scene of
<>manifold action) as man and woman are for the product-
<>ion of progeny. From Purus2a (male), Prakr2ti (female)
<>originated and then they together created the Prapan5ca.
<>The Vedas and Pura1n2as make statements everywhere
<>regarding Prakr2ti and Purus2a and three of the most
<>important ones are given below:
<NI>1) ‘Pra’ means ‘principal’ and ‘Kr2ti’ means ‘creation’.
<>Therefore the word is meant to convey the meaning
<>‘one that is the principal factor for creation’, ‘Pra’ means [Page599-b+ 65]
<>‘sa1ttvic’, ‘Kr2’ means ‘ra1jasic’ and ‘ta’ means ‘ta1masic’
<>and the word ‘Prakr2ti’ thus conveys the power of the
<>three gun2as’. ‘Pra’ means ‘before’ and ‘Kr2ti’ means
<>creation and so Prakr2ti means that which existed be-
<>fore creation.
<NI>Before creation Prakr2ti lay merged with the Supreme
<>Spirit without separate existence. But when the desire
<>for creation was aroused, this Supreme Spirit divided
<>itself into Prakr2ti and Purus2a. Then the right half
<>becomes ‘Purus2a’ and the left half ‘Prakr2ti’ Even though
<>they are thus two yogi1ndras (kings among sages)
<>they see themselves as merged with the eternal One like
<>fire and heat and assert the truth Sarvam3 Brahma-
<>mayam (everything is Brahman, the Supreme Spirit).
<>It was this basic Prakr2ti that took forms as the five
<>goddesses, Durga1, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1, Sa1vitri1 and
<>Ra1dha1. (9th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) Purus2a is the vital sentient Truth that sets in action
<>the entire Prapan5ca. This Purus2a is Supreme among
<>the Supreme, beyond human comprehension, without
<>form, colour, name, without origin, growth, change or
<>end, residing in himself and that which can only be
<>imagined to exist. This purus2a has got two different
<>forms, the visible and the invisible and also a third
<>imaginary one, time. The sages call Purus2a the Su1ks2ma-
<>prakr2ti (The subtle all-pervading spirit, the supreme
<>soul). This Su1ks2maprakr2ti which cannot be measured
<>by any unit of measure, is not attached to anyhing, is
<>imperishable, is without decrepitude, is immovable and
<>is without the senses of sound, touch smell or form.
<>This Prakr2ti endowed with the three gun2as, without
<>beginning or end is eternal, is the root cause of this
<>Prapan5ca. This Prakr2ti pervaded over Prapan5ca from
<>the beginning of the great Deluge to the beginning of
<>creation. Brahmajn5a1nins who were great seers and who
<>knew the truth of the Vedas speak about Prakr2ti thus:
<>“There was no night or day then, neither the earth
<>nor the sky, neither light nor darkness. There was no-
<>thing but this. There was only one Brahman merged in
<>which were Prakr2ti and Purusa, a brahman which
<>could not be understood by any of the five senses nor by
<>intelligence. It was from the supreme being of Vis2n2u
<>that the two forms Prakr2ti and Purus2a originated.
<>These two were separated from Vis2n2u at the time of
<>the great deluge and again joined together at the
<>time of creation. The form of Vis2n2u from which these
<>occurred was termed Time. During the last great deluge
<>this visible Prapan5ca merged with it and so, this deluge
<>was called Pra1kr2tapralaya. Time is eternal, having no
<>end and so the process of Sr2s2t2i, Sthiti and Sam3ha1ra
<>(creation, existence and destruction) continued without
<>any interruption.
<NI>After that, during Pralaya (deluge), Prakr2ti and Purus2a
<>stand apart due to equality of the gun2as, Sattva, Rajas
<>and Tamas in Prakr2ti. Vis2n2u in the form of Time starts
<>the work to join them both together. Then when the
<>time of creation came Vis2n2u, the Supreme Being, the
<>supreme soul, the god of all living beings, omnipresent
<>and omnipotent by his will entered the emotionless
<>Purus2a and emotional Prakr2ti and created sensations in
<>them. Smell is the sense which creates sensation in one
<>by its nearness to it. Just like that Vis2n2u by his very
<>presence near them created disturbances in them. It is
<>Vis2n2u, the best of Purus2as, who acts as Prakr2ti which
<>can disturb and which can be disturbed, which exists [Page600-a+ 65]
<>in states of contraction and expansion. It is Vis2n2u, the
<>god of the gods, who exists in forms of Su1ks2ma and
<>Sthu1la, and as the great tattva and as the devas like
<>Brahma1.
<NI>The Mahattattva originated from Prakr2ti, which was
<>existing as emotionless due to the equalisation of the
<>three gun2as, when at the time of creation Vis2n2u, Truth
<>in the form of Ks2etrajn5a (knower), merged with Pra-
<>kr2ti. The Mahattattva in its three forms, Sattva, Rajas
<>and Tamas lay enveloped by Prakr2ti just as a seed
<>is covered by its husk. From this Mahattattva originat-
<>ed the three egos, Vaika1rika, Taijasa and Ta1masa, the
<>cause of the Pan5cabhu1tas. Because that ego contained
<>the three gun2as it became the cause of the origin of the
<>bhu1tas (elements) and indriyas (senses). Ego pervaded
<>the Mahattattva just as the Mahattattva pervaded
<>(Am3s4a 1, Chapter 2, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>3) In the beginning during the Deluge the world was
<>all water. Then S4iva tore open his thigh and dropped
<>a drop of blood in the waters. It became a huge egg. He
<>broke it and from it came out Purus2a and from Purus2a
<>he made Prakr2ti for the creation of the Prapan5ca. These
<>two, Prakr2ti and Purus2a, created the Praja1patis and
<>they in turn created the praja1s. Purus2a seeing the vast
<>creation going on due to him became arrogant and
<>S4iva chopped off his head. S4iva became repentant of his
<>hasty deed later. To atone for his sin he took the skull
<>in his hand and vowed that he would ever carry a skull in
<>his hand and that he would live in cremation grounds.
<>The two halves of the great egg became a1ka1s4a and
<>bhu1mi (earth and sky). (Taran3ga 2, Katha1pi1t2halambaka,
<>Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>RALAMBA I. A notorious da1nava born to Kas4yapa-
<>praja1pati of his wife Danu. (S4loka 29, Chapter 65,
<>A1di Parva).
<HI>PRALAMBA II. An asura (demon). He attacked S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma and was killed by Balara1ma. (10th
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>PRALAYA (Destruction). Pralaya is of four kinds. The
<>first is nityapralaya. This is the destruction going on daily
<>for all animate and inanimate objects born on earth.
<>The second is Bra1hmapralaya or naimittikapralaya. The
<>third is Pra1kr2tapralaya. This is the great deluge made by
<>prakr2ti (nature) at the end of a thousand Caturyugas
<>(four yugas). The fourth is a1tyantikapralaya. This is the
<>union of the soul with the Supreme Being due to Jn5a1na.
<>Of the above the Bra1hmapralaya, or naimittikapralaya
<>happens at the end of a Kalpa or a day of Brahma1 or
<>a thousand yugas. The nature of this pralaya is as
<>follows: At the end of a thousand yugas the world
<>will look famished. Then there will be excessive
<>drought for a hundred years together and everything
<>in this world would be destroyed then. Then Maha1-
<>vis2n2u, lord of everything in this universe, would pre-
<>sent himself in the seven big rays of the Sun and
<>drink to emptiness all the waters of all the three
<>worlds, earth, ocean and pa1ta1la. Then by the divine
<>power of Maha1vis2n2u the seven rays of the Sun which
<>had grown fat by drinking this water would become
<>seven separate Suns. These Suns would burn all the
<>three worlds including Pa1ta1la. Then the earth would
<>look like the back of a tortoise (Ku1rmapr2s2t2ha) At
<>that time Rudra, equal in brilliance to Ka1la1gni, would
<>from beneath burn the pa1ta1la sending breaths from
<>A1dis4esa. After pa1ta1la Ka1la1gnirudra would burn the [Page600-b+ 65]
<>earth and then the heavens. Because of this all the
<>worlds would look like globes of fire. Then the inhabit-
<>ants of these worlds would go to Maharloka unable to
<>bear the heat and from there to Janaloka. Thus Vis2n2u
<>in the form of Rudra would destroy everything.
<NI>Then from the face of Vis2n2u would originate clouds
<>and lightning in different forms. Those clouds would
<>rain incessantly for a hundred years and destroy the
<>fire prevailing everywhere. When the rains become
<>unbearable Va1yu would encroach upon the seats of the
<>Saptars2is in the ocean and by the breath of Vis2n2u
<>destroy all the clouds. At that time Vis2n2u, lord of all,
<>would lie on the back of A1dis4es2a in that one big
<>ocean drinking va1yu (air). Vis2n2u will lie thus for a
<>period of a Kalpa in yogic slumber meditating on
<>Va1sudeva taking the name Madhusu1dana and form
<>of Brahma1 praised by the siddhamunis inside the
<>ocean. After that he would take the form of Brahma1
<>and start creation.
<NI>In Pra1kr2tapralaya this whole universe would lie in
<>extinction for a period of two para1rddhas. One
<>para1rddha is 100000000000000000 years (one followed
<>by seventeen zeroes) and so the period of a pra1kr2ta-
<>pralaya is double the above number of years. The world
<>would then come into the grip of a great drought;
<>fire would break out and burn away everything in
<>this world from Mahattattva to Vis4es2a. Then prompted
<>by the desire of Vis2n2u, pratisan5caran2a (back into
<>nature) would occur. Then Jala (water) would
<>absorb the gun2as of bhu1mi like gandha (smell) and
<>when the qualities of the earth are thus absorbed the
<>earth would merge with pralaya. Jala is rasa1tmaka.
<>Agni will absorb the rasa of Jala and Jala would be
<>kindled. The gun2a of Agni is form and is in the form
<>of Sun. Va1yu would absorb it and Agni would be
<>destroyed. Va1yu would then become powerful and
<>shake the world. The quality of Va1yu is touch and the
<>ether would absorb that gun2a of Va1yu and Va1yu would
<>be destroyed. The quality of ether is sound and it
<>would be absorbed by the elements. If the elements
<>are absorbed one by one the earth would merge into
<>water (Jala) and Jala in Agni, and Agni in Va1yu and
<>Va1yu in ether and ether in Ahan3ka1ra (ego). Ahan3ka1ra
<>would merge in Mahattattva. This Mahattattva would
<>be absorbed by Prakr2ti. Prakr2ti has got two forms:--
<>Vyakta and Avyakta (Manifest and Un-manifest). The
<>Vyakta would merge with Avyakta. Purus2a is single,
<>pure and without decay. But he is also part of Para-
<>ma1tma1 (the Supreme Being). So Prakr2ti and Purus2a
<>would both merge into the Supreme Being. There are
<>no distinctions, fabrications in Parama1tma1, the lord of
<>all. It is only an existence. It is such a Parama1tma1
<>that should be known and which itself is knowledge.
<>The Parama1tma1 is beyond the A1tma1 (soul). It is in
<>such an indescribable Parama1tma1 that all are dissolv-
<>ed during a Pra1kr2tapralaya. (Chapter 368, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>PRAMADA. A son of Vasis2t2ha. He was one of the
<>Saptars2is of Uttama Manvantara. (6th Skandha,

<HI>PRAMADVARA1. Wife of Ruru.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Pramadvara1 was the daughter of the nymph
<>Menaka1 born of the Gandharva Vis4va1vasu. As soon
<>as the child was born, Menaka1 threw the child into
<>the forest and left for Devaloka. [Page601-a+ 65]
<>Sthu1lakes4a, a sage who was engaged in penance in that
<>forest in a hermitage heard the cry of a child and
<>came out of his a1s4rama. On seeing a new-born child
<>lying unclaimed and uncared for, he took the child to
<>his a1s4rama and named her Pramadvara1 and brought
<>her up. She grew into a charming maiden and
<>one day Prince Ruru coming that way while hunting
<>saw her and fell in love with her. The sage was pleased
<>to give her in marriage to the King and so fixed the
<>date of marriage.
<NI>The day previous to her marriage she trampled over
<>a poisonous snake while walking in the forest with her
<>companions and immediately she fell dead by the bite
<>of the serpent. Ruru's grief was uncontrollable.
<>He wept bitterly crying aloud “If I have from my very
<>birth with great devotion taken vows, let Pramadvara1
<>rise up alive.” Then a devadu1ta (messenger from god)
<>appeared before him and said that all his wails were of
<>no avail since it was only in the order of things that
<>one whose a1yus (period of life on earth) was over
<>should die. Ruru then enquired of him a way of escape
<>from this inevitable calamity and then the devadu1ta said
<>that if Ruru was prepared to surrender half of his a1yus
<>in favour of Pramadvara1 she would come back to life.
<>Ruru agreed and they went to Dharmara1ja (god of
<>Death) and told him of his wish. Dharmara1ja brought
<>back Pramadvara1 to life and she stood before Ruru
<>as if just woken up from sleep. Their marriage was duly
<>conducted. (Chapters 8 and 9, A1di Parva).

<HI>PRAMI1LA1. Chief of the Stri1ra1jya (country of women)
<>in the Hima1layas. The Pa1n2d2avas conducted an as4vame-

<>body daring to tie it the horse reached Stri1ra1jya and
<>Prami1la1 tied the horse. Arjuna challenged her and in
<>the fight that ensued Prami1la1 defeated Arjuna. At that
<>time there was a voice from heaven which said “Arjuna,
<>you will never be able to take back the horse after de-
<>feating Prami1la1. So if you want to save the sacrificial

<HI>PRAMODA III. One of the Ma1nasaputras (Spiritual

<HI>PRAMOHINI1. A Gandharva maiden. Pramohini1 and
<>four Gandharva maidens were absolved from their cur-
<>ses by a drop of water from the river Narmada1. The
<>story recounted to Yudhis2t2hira by Na1rada is as follows:
<>Five Gandharva maidens Pramohini1, Sus4i1la1, Susvara1,
<>Candrika1 and Suta1ra1 were friends. Pramohini1 was the
<>daughter of S4ukasan3gi1ti, Sus4i1la1 that of Sus4i1la, Susvara1
<>of Svaravedi1, Candrika1 that of Candraka and Suta1ra1
<>of Suprabha. On a day in spring all the five went about
<>collecting flowers in a forest. As they went on walking
<>they reached the pond named Acchoda. They bathed in
<>that pond and after that made an idol of Ambika1 with [Page602-a+ 65]
<>clay and adorned it with golden ornaments. Putting
<>marks on it with Kumkum (Saffron) and Candana (San-
<>dalwood-paste) they danced around the idol with devo-
<>tional songs. As they were doing so, the eldest son of
<>sage Vedanidhi came to bathe in the Acchoda pond.
<>He was very charming to look at with eyes like lotus,
<>broad chest and round and brawny hands. He looked
<>like another Ka1madeva (Cupid). He was wearing a
<>deer-hide and around his waist was a yellow waist-band
<>of Mun5ja grass. The five girls were attracted by the
<>ascetic youth and stopping their dancing they at first
<>thought of making him their guest. The more the girls
<>looked at him the more they saw a resemblance of Ka1ma-
<>deva in him and they decided to make him their hus-
<>band. The girls started to approach him with amorous
<>looks and perplexed by this move, the ascetic youth
<>fled away from the place. The girls searched for him
<>everywhere and he was not to be found. They found an
<>emptiness on all sides. They thought that perhaps he
<>might be a magician. They felt themselves in the plight
<>similar to that of the gopi1s who searched for the missing
<>Kr2s2n2a. Somehow taking courage they reached their homes
<>and fell down before their mothers. The mothers asked
<>them why they were so late and they replied they knew
<>not the passage of time speaking with the Kinnari1s who
<>arrived there. Their bodies were hot and the mothers
<>thought that it might be due to their brisk walking for
<>such a long distance.
<NI>Telling a lie like that to hide their secret, they lay on
<>the ground thinking about him and him alone. They
<>did not make the Keli1mayu1ra (peacock kept for pleas-
<>ure) dance, did not teach the parrot in the cage, did
<>not pet the mongoose nor did they converse with
<>their pet S4a1rika1. The night seemed to them like a yuga
<>and as soon as it was morning they ran up to the Acchoda
<>pond. The brahmin boy came there that morning also
<>for bathing. The five girls encircled him and requested
<>him to marry them. He made several excuses and tried
<>to get away from them. Then Pramohini1 breaking the
<>circle went and caught hold of him by his legs, Sus4i1la1
<>and Susvara1 caught hold of his hands, Suta1ra1 embraced
<>him and Candrika1 kissed him on his cheeks. At last in des-
<>pair the brahmin boy cursed them and turned them into
<>devils. The girls were not to be subdued like that. They
<>also cursed him in return and made him also a devil.
<>All the devils formed like that by curses and counter-
<>curses lived in the same place in the forest. After a
<>long time one day the sage Lomas4a came that way by
<>chance and the burning effulgence of Lomas4a due to his
<>severe penance made him unapproachable to the devils
<>and they stood at a great distance from him. But the
<>brahmin devil by the strength of his penance in his
<>previous life knew Lomas4a and falling before him in
<>prostration told him everything that had happened.
<>Lomas4a was greatly moved by his story and he took
<>them to the banks of the river Narmada1. At that time
<>a wind blew and drops of water from the river, changed
<>them into their original forms and they stood praising
<>Narmada1. Then following the advice of Lomas4a the
<>brahmin boy married the five girls and lived on the
<>shores of Narmada1 bathing in it, drinking its water and
<>worshipping it. They lived there for long happily and
<>then attained Vis2n2uloka. (Chapter 22, Padma Pura1n2a)

<>bha1rata. (S4loka 29, Chapter 208, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PRA1N2A I. Grandson of sage Bhr2gu. Bhr2gu got of his wife
<>Khya1ti a daughter named Laks2mi1 and two sons named
<>Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1. They married A1yati and Niyati

<NI>There were two celebrated carpenters in the country of
<>Ka1n5ci1 named Pra1n2adhara and Ra1jyadhara when King
<>Ba1hubala was ruling that country. They learnt many
<>mechanical arts in carpentry and architecture from the
<>great architect, Maya1sura. Pra1n2adhara, the elder
<>brother, became an addict to wine and women and
<>gambling and lost all his wealth. Ra1jyadhara gave a
<>portion of his wealth to his brother and before long
<>both became poor. Then Pra1n2adhara found out a plan
<>and they both together made a mechanical bird and tying
<>a rope to its legs sent it into the treasure-house of the
<>King through a window. The bird picked up diamonds
<>or ornaments which it could carry in its beak and came
<>back to them. This continued daily for some days and
<>then Ra1jyadhara advised his brother to stop it acquaint-
<>ing him with the dangers if it was ever found out.
<>But Pra1n2adhara did not heed the advice and continued
<>the theft. When the keeper of the treasury found things
<>missing he was worried. He mused: “Doors are not
<>open. Can it be rats? No, there has never been a single
<>rat here before. Then how did it happen?” Thinking
<>thus he went and reported the matter to the king. The [Page603-a+ 64]
<>King was confident of the keeper. Soon he put guards over
<>the treasure-house to keep watch over it at night. Little
<>knowing that he was being watched Pra1n2adhara put
<>his bird into action that night also. The watchmen
<>caught hold of the rope as soon as the bird came out with
<>the booty from the treasure-house. Pra1n2adhara knew
<>that the trick had been found out and he rushed to
<>his brother and told him what had happened. Immedi-
<>ately Pra1n2adhara made a Vima1na and escaped from the
<>place with his family. Ra1jyadhara also made a Vima1na
<>and escaped. When he had travelled in the Vima1na for
<>four hundred Ka1tas (Ka1ta=four miles) he reached a
<>sea-shore and then leaving the Vima1na there started
<>walking. On the way getting tired he slept inside a
<>garden. When he woke up, a man on a peacock came to
<>his side and said “You live here. When you are hungry
<>and feel like taking food go to the second floor of this
<>house and you will find there whatever you want.”
<>The visitor disappeared and he found a house in front
<>of him. When he had finished his daily ablutions he
<>went inside the house which was empty. But when he
<>went up he saw ample food in gold vessels arranged there.
<>He never heard about his brother again. (Taran3ga 9,
<>Ratnaprabha1lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).

<>cross-legged, controlling all actions of the sense-organs
<>and concentrating on one single object do pra1n2a1ya1ma
<>for the purification of the soul. There are three different
<>kinds of pra1n2a1ya1mas namely Recakapra1n2a1ya1ma, Pu1ra-
<>kapra1n2a1ya1ma and Kumbhakapra1n2a1ya1ma.
<NI>Holding the nostrils with the left hand and massaging
<>the belly with the other hand one sends out the air within
<>the belly. It is called Recakapra1n2a1ya1ma. Doing just the
<>reverse and getting air inside is called Pu1rakapra1n2a1-
<>ya1ma. Then the yogi1 sits, with his belly full of air.
<>Sitting thus without either letting the air out or letting
<>it in is called Kumbhakapra1n2a1ya1ma. Here the yogi1 sits
<>like a pu1rn2a-kumbha (full jar). The body of man is a
<>chariot, the sense organs its horses, mind the charioteer
<>and pra1n2a1ya1ma the whip. (Chapter 373, Agni Pura1n2a).

<>(Sun) were friends. Once Satra1jit requested Su1rya
<>to give him some gift as a token of their friendship.
<>Then Su1rya gave him the Syamantaka gem. If that
<>stone was worshipped daily with pu1ja1s by bra1hman2as
<>it would yield eight loads of gold daily. When once
<>Satra1jit travelled by air with that gem round his neck
<>the people of Dva1raka1 mistook him for Vis2n2u. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a was attracted by the beauty and power of that
<>stone and he asked Satra1jit that gem for a good price.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a offered as much money as he wanted and

<NI>When Prasena did not return from his hunting and
<>was found later lying dead without the gem the news
<>spread that the stone might have been stolen by
<>Kr2s2n2a after killing Prasena. The slander reached the
<>ears of Kr2s2n2a also and he went to the forest in search
<>of the Syamantaka. He found the cave of Ja1mbava1n
<>and on peeping in found the children of Ja1mbava1n
<>playing with the gem. Ja1mbava1n attacked Kr2s2n2a and
<>after a grim battle which lasted for several days
<>Ja1mbava1n was defeated. When he knew that it was
<>Kr2s2n2a who had defeated him he gave him along with

<>Bhava. (Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Chapter 14, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>PRASENAJIT IV. A King who lived in the city of
<>S4ra1vasti1. Once a very virtuous brahmin came to this
<>city. Finding him to be a man of great virtues a Vais4ya
<>took him to his house and kept him there worshipping
<>him. Many rich men coming to know of the brahmin
<>came and worshipped him with offerings of costly
<>clothes and ornaments. Within a short time the poor
<>brahmin got a huge heap of gold and silver. He collect-
<>ed his lot and at night without letting anybody know
<>went and buried it in a secret place in the forest.
<>After some days he went and looked for it and found
<>his buried wealth missing. When the brahmin returned
<>weeping, the host, the Vais4ya, gathered from him all
<>that had happened. The house-holder consoled him
<>but the miserly and greedy brahmin was not to be
<>pacified thus and he started to commit suicide. He
<>went to a pond nearby and was about to jump into it
<>when Prasenajit who heard about this came to the
<>spot and told him thus:--“Do not grieve over your
<>loss. I shall make enquiries about it and if the stolen
<>wealth is not recovered I shall give you compensation
<>from my treasury.”
<NI>After consoling the brahmin thus the King went to
<>his palace. He pretended to be ill and called the
<>physicians of the city to his side. He asked them about
<>their patients, their illness and the medicines prescribed
<>for them. One of the physicians during the enquiry
<>said thus: “Oh lord, Ma1tr2dattavan2ik is my patient.
<>Yesterday I prescribed to him the root of U1raka
<>plant.” The King soon dispersed the physicians and
<>sent for Ma1tr2dattavan2ik and asked him who had
<>brought for him the root. When Ma1tr2dattavan2ik
<>replied that it was his servant the King sent for the
<>servant and on questioning the servant the latter

<>behind the birth of the son S4antanu to Prati1pa.
<NI>One day this Ra1jars2i was worshipping the Sun-god in
<>the waters of the river Gan3ga1, when a beautiful
<>maiden rose from the waters and sat on the right thigh
<>of the royal ascetic. The King was embarrassed and
<>he told her thus:--“Oh sweet girl, who are you?
<>Do you realise what an unrighteous deed you have
<>done? Why did you thus climb on my thigh without
<>seeking my permission? The right thigh is for the
<>daughter and the wife of the son. Since you have thus
<>sat on my right thigh, you shall be the wife of my son
<>when one is born to me.”
<NI>Hearing this the maiden jumped out from the thigh of
<>the King and left the place and the King went to his
<>palace. After some time Prati1pa got a son named
<>S4antanu. S4antanu was none other than emperor
<>Maha1bhis2ak who was forced to be born on earth due
<>to a curse of Brahma1. When S4antanu came of age
<>Prati1pa decided to spend the rest of his life in forests
<>and calling his son to his side gave him all advice and
<>added “Son, perhaps a maiden may come to you and
<>if she comes accept her as your wife. Do not ask her
<>about her identity. By making her your truthful wife

<>(S4loka 35, Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<NI>It is believed that at Praya1ga there is the presence of
<>Brahma1, devata1s, dikpa1lakas (guardians of the quarters),
<>lokapa1lakas (guardians of the world), Sa1dhyas (realised
<>souls), Pitr2s (manes), Mahars2is like Sanatkuma1ra, An3giras,
<>Brahmars2is, Na1gas, Garud2a, Siddhas, Su1ryadeva and [Page606-b+ 65]
<>Maha1vis2n2u. There are three fire-pits there. The river
<>Gan3ga1 runs through the centre of these pits. The
<>Centre of the confluence of Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1 is be-
<>lieved to be the waist of the world. There is at Praya1ga
<>the world-famous Triven2i1 confluence. If one bathes at
<>that place one gets the benefit of As4vamedha and Ra1ja-
<>su1ya together.
<NI>The greatness of Praya1ga is described thus: Praya1ga-
<>ti1rtha, Pratis2t2ha1nati1rtha, Kambalati1rtha, As4vatarati1rtha,
<>and Bhogavati1ti1rtha are said to be the Ya1gavedi1s of
<>Praja1pati. At such a Praya1ga Vedas and Yajn5as live
<>personified. If one praises it or chants its name in
<>songs or smears the mud from it on one's body, one
<>would be absolved of all sins. If one gives away any-
<>thing in charity at this place or conducts S4ra1ddha
<>(ceremony of giving offerings to deceased relatives) or
<>does pious mutterings one would get benefits of an
<>imperishable nature. There are about seventy thousand
<>ti1rthas in this world, ten thousand of one kind and sixty
<>thousand of another kind. Praya1ga has the presence of
<>all these ti1rthas and so it is considered as the best of all
<>ti1rthas. Here is the Bhogavati1ti1rtha of Va1suki and the ti1rtha
<>called Ham3saprapatana. If one bathes in the ponds
<>there for three days together one would get the credit
<>of giving as charity a crore of cows. The three impor-
<>tant places are the Gan3ga1dva1ra, Praya1ga and Gan3ga1-
<>sa1garasan3gama. Chapter 211, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>PRA1YAS4CITTA. In ancient Bha1rata sacred injunctions
<>existed about religious rites to be performed for the
<>atonement of sins committed. The following are a few
<>of them.
<NI>Murder is that act which ends in loss of life. One who
<>kills a brahmin is a Brahmagha1taka. Even if murder is
<>actually committed by one man, all those involved in
<>a conspiracy for murder are murderers. If death occurs
<>while treating a patient it is no murder. If death
<>occurs when you punish your son, disciple or wife it is
<>no sin. If he who has killed a brahmin or a cow
<>commits suicide he will be absolved from his sin. Or he
<>should go about begging with a skull and the organ of
<>generation of any animal. If he spends twelve years
<>begging eating little and with repentance in his heart
<>the Brahmagha1taka will be absolved of his sin and
<>he will become pure. If the murder is done to serve a
<>purpose of his he should live as a beggar for twelve
<>years but if it is not done to gain any end of his, he
<>need live only for six years as a beggar. If a brahmin
<>attempts to murder another brahmin he should observe
<>the above vow for three years. If the attempt is made
<>by a Ks2atriya he should double the period; if by a
<>Vais4ya or S4u1dra, triple the period If a brahmin kills
<>a Ks2atriya he need observe only three fourths of the
<>pra1yas4citta. If a brahmin kills a Vais4ya or S4u1dra he
<>need observe only an eighth part of the pra1yas4citta. If he
<>kills a woman he should observe the punishment fixed
<>for killing a S4u1dra.
<NI>If a brahmin does ‘gohatya1’ (killing a cow) he should
<>practise penance drinking Pan5cagavya (five products of
<>the cow taken collectively). He should sleep in a cow-
<>shed and go about feeding the cow and should also give
<>away cows as gift. If a gohatya1 is committed by a per-
<>son of any other caste, he need observe only three
<>fourths of the pra1yas4citta. Hitting the cows by fists,
<>piercing their body with nails and cutting their horns
<>are to be classified under gohatya1. If one kills a cat [Page607-a+ 64]
<>mongoose, frog dog, or a bird, one should drink milk
<>for three days.
<NI>Though wine, date-palm-juice sugar-cane-juice,
<>black-palm-juice, tamarind-juice and toddy are intoxi-
<>cants they are not classified under alcoholic liquors.
<>Real liquor or sura1 is that made from rice flour.
<>Drinking liquor is prohibited to Brahmins, Ks2atriyas
<>and Vais4yas. If any one of these castes drinks he should
<>drink water after performing penance or live eating
<>pippali1 (long pepper) for a year or eat oil cake at night
<>for a year. If one drinks water in a pot used for taking
<>liquor one should observe the pra1yas4citta for seven days.
<>If he drinks water from a ca1n2d2a1la he should observe the
<>pra1yas4citta for six days. If one eats rice from a ca1n2d2a1la
<>one should observe Ca1ndra1yan2a. (an expiatory penance
<>of decreasing and then increasing food according to the
<>waxing and waning of the moon). If one eats food in
<>the house of a S4u1dra during times of distress, one
<>would be absolved of the sin by repentance alone.
<>Taking another man's property and appropriating it to
<>himself is called theft. He who steals gold should be
<>struck on the head by a wooden pestle by the king and
<>killed. Alternatively he should live for twelve years
<>with matted hair, eating one time a day only such
<>things as leaves, fruits and roots and lying on earth. He
<>who steals diamonds, pearls, corals, copper, silver, iron,
<>bronze and granite stones should fast for twelve years.
<>He who enjoys sexual intercourse with his father's wife,
<>own sister, daughter of his preceptor or wife of the
<>preceptor should burn himself in a hot iron pot. Alter-
<>natively he should embrace a red hot iron idol of a
<>woman and die. (Chapters 183 and 184, Agni Pura1n2a).

<>133, A1di Parva).
<HI>PRETAGRANTHA. A very ancient book of the Egypt-

<NI>Priyavrata once circled round Meru in his chariot. As
<>if competing with the Sun Priyavrata started his circling
<>along with sunrise and ended it at sunset. He did so
<>seven days making nights look like day and the sun
<>appear dim and faded. The Sun was dejected and it
<>was at the request of the Trimu1rtis that Priyavrata
<>stopped his circumambulation. It was the path of Priya-

<>oceans of Pura1n2ic fame. (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).

<NI>Even from boyhood Pr2s2adhra started practice of
<>penance. He got disgusted with life even from his
<>boyhood. A story is told how it happened so. Once
<>when Pr2s2adhra was studying under his Guru, a tiger
<>entered the shed of the cows at night. Hearing the piti-
<>able wails of the cow he went to the shed with his sword
<>and gave a strong and fatal cut to the tiger with it. Un-
<>fortunately the stroke fell on the cow instead of the tiger
<>and not knowing the truth in the darkness Pr2s2adhra
<>went and slept peacefully. In the morning when he
<>went to the shed he found the cow lying dead with

<>disciple and cursed Pr2s2adhra to death. to be born as

<NI>1) In the early part of the period of Sva1yambhuva
<>Manu the Praja1pati named Sutapas and his wife Pr2s4ni
<>did penance for twelve thousand divine years to get
<>Vis2n2u as their son. As a result of that Vis2n2u was born
<>in the womb of Pr2s4ni as Pr2s4nigarbha. The name was
<>suited for S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the incarnation of Vis2n2u also.
<>(Chapter 3, 10th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) Anna (rice), Veda, Jala (water) and amr2ta (nectar)
<>are called Pr2s4ni and so Maha1vis2n2u (Kr2s2n2a) who bears
<>these inside is called Pr2s4nigarbha. (S4loka 45, Chapter
<>342, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PR2TANA1. The name of a division of the army. (See
<>under Aks2auhin2i1).
<HI>PR2THA1. See under Kunti1.
<HI>PR2THA1S4VA. An ancient king who worships Yama. (S4loka
<>19, Chapter 9, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>PR2THU I. (VAINYA). A King of great virtue born in
<>the line of Dhruva.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u--
<>Brahma1--Sva1yambhuva Manu--Utta1napa1da--Dhruva
<>S4is2t2i--Ripu--Ca1ks2us2a Manu--Kuru--An3ga--Vena--
<>Pr2thu.
<NI>Manu, son of Ca1ks2us2a, got of his wife Nad2vala1 eleven
<>sons Puru, Kuru, Pu1ru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satya-
<>va1k, S4uci, Agnis2t2u, Atiratha, Sudyumna and
<>Abhimanyu. Of these the second son Kuru got of his
<>wife A1treyi1 seven sons named An3ga, Sumanas, Sva1ti
<>Kratu, An3giras, Gaya and S4ibi. An3ga married Suni1tha1.
<>She delivered a very wicked son named Vena. Pr2thu
<>was born to Vena. Pr2thu got six sons named Antar-
<>dha1na, Va1di1, Su1ta, Ma1gadha, Pa1lita and Vijita1s4va. [Page608-b+ 64]
<NI>2) {%Birth and Coronation.%} Suni1tha1, wife of An3ga, was
<>the eldest daughter of Yama. Vena was born of her.
<>Vena, the grandson of Yama, because of hereditary
<>traits from his grandfather, was very wicked even from
<>birth. When Vena was crowned king by the mahars2is
<>and he became the supreme lord of the world he an-
<>nounced to the world thus: “Ya1gas should not be per-
<>formed; gifts should not be given; no kind of homa
<>should be done. There is nobody but me to accept as
<>Yajn5apurus2a the share of yajn5as. I am the sole lord and
<>consumer of yajn5as.”
<NI>The sages were dumbfounded. They all approached
<>Vena and impressed upon him the necessity of perform-
<>ing a Ya1ga to propitiate Maha1vis2n2u. Vena who got
<>angry at this request of the sages told them thus:
<>“There is nobody greater than I and I have none to be
<>worshipped. Who is Hari, your Yajn5es4vara? (lord of
<>the ya1ga). All such great powers who can bless and
<>curse alike and such eminent deities and entities like
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva, Indra, Va1yu, Yama, Varun2a,
<>Su1rya, Agni, Dha1ta1, Pu1s2a1, Bhu1mi and Candra are
<>merged in me, the king. Do understand this fact and
<>obey my orders.”
<NI>Despite repeated requests Vena did not give permission
<>to conduct a Vais2n2ava yajn5a. The sages got angry and
<>cried aloud “Kill this wicked man”, “Kill this wicked
<>man”. Saying thus the sages killed Vena by Kus4a grass
<>made sacred and powerful by mantras--Vena, who was
<>spiritually dead because of his contempt of the gods
<>even before. Then the sages saw dust rising in columns
<>from all sides and asked the people the cause of the
<>same. The people said “When they knew that there was
<>no king poor people have turned themselves into rogues
<>and are plundering the wealth of the rich. The swift
<>movements of these running in haste are raising dust
<>from the ground below.”
<NI>The r2s2is conferred together and to get a son from
<>the dead Vena they churned the thigh of the wicked
<>king. Then from the thigh came out a short and black
<>(as black as a burnt pillar) man with a compressed face
<>who stood before the sages in distress and asked “What
<>am I to do?” The sages said ‘Nis2i1da’ meaning ‘sit
<>down’. He thus became Nis2a1da (an illiterate forest-
<>dweller). He went to the mountain of Vindhya and
<>along with him went all the sins of Vena. Nis2a1das there-
<>after are said to be those who have destroyed the sins
<>of Vena.
<NI>Then the sages churned the right hand of Vena and
<>from it came out a brilliant boy of great strength and
<>power and he was named Pr2thu. At the time of his
<>birth there dropped from heaven the divine bow Aja-
<>gava and many powerful arrows and a divine armour.
<>All animate objects of the world were happy at his birth.
<>Vena attained svarga for having delivered such a brilli-
<>ant son. For the coronation of Pr2thu the oceans brought
<>very many precious diamonds and the rivers holy water.
<>Brahma1 along with A1n3girases came and crowned Pr2thu
<>as the emperor. Brahma1 saw the line of Candra in his
<>right hand and was, therefore, pleased to know that he
<>was part of Maha1vis2n2u. Thus Pr2thu, valiant and brill-
<>iant, was crowned their emperor by the virtuous people
<>of Bha1rata.
<NI>He united his people by his love for them. When he
<>travelled through the ocean the water stood still and [Page609-a+ 64]
<>when he travelled on land the mountains gave way and
<>his flag-pole was never obstructed anywhere.
<NI>3) {%Su1ta-Ma1gadhas.%} Brahma1 performed a ya1ga as soon
<>as Pr2thu was born. From that ya1ga was born a very
<>wise and intelligent demon named Su1ta. A scholarly
<>Ma1gadha also was born from the ya1ga. The mahars2is
<>commanded the Su1ta-Ma1gadhas to praise Pr2thu and
<>they then said “Oh revered sages, we do not know
<>anything good or bad about this king just born. He
<>has not earned a name or fame. Then on what basis
<>are we to sing praises about him?” The mahars2is said
<>that they should praise him for the qualities he should
<>have in future. Pr2thu heard that and feeling elated
<>decided to become a very virtuous emperor. When
<>Pr2thu was thinking like that the Su1ta-Ma1gadhas sang
<>in melodious tones thus: “This king speaks the truth
<>always, is charitable, is one who keeps his promises,
<>is valiant and full of all good qualities.” Thus with the
<>blessings and good wishes of all, Pr2thu started his reign.
<NI>4) {%Pr2thu attacks the Earth.%} The people were hungry
<>for want of proper food crops. They approached Pr2thu
<>and told him that during the short interval between
<>Vena's death and Pr2thu's assuming charge the goddess
<>of earth drew inside all her vegetations and so the peo-
<>ple were put to great difficulties. They requested him
<>to generate vegetations again.
<NI>Pr2thu got angry on hearing this and taking his bow
<>Ajagava and several arrows went in search of the god-
<>dess of earth. The goddess got frightened and fled taking
<>the form of a cow. She went to all lokas but Pr2thu fol-
<>lowed her with his bow and arrows everywhere. At last
<>desiring to escape from the arrows of such a valiant
<>king Bhu1midevi1 went to him and trembling with fear said
<>“Oh king, why do you make such a persistent attempt,
<>to kill me which would be the great sin of Stri1vadha?
<>(killing a woman).” The Ra1ja1 replied that there was
<>no sin in killing wicked persons. The goddess asked
<>what refuge was there for the people if the earth was
<>destroyed. The king said that he would protect his
<>people by the power of his yoga. Bhu1midevi1 was fright-
<>ened and she said “Oh king, I shall give you back all
<>I have destroyed in the form of milk. Therefore, virt-
<>uous as you are, if you are really interested in the wel-
<>fare of the people I shall allow you to milk me and
<>take back everything you want. Do bring a calf.”
<NI>5) {%Pr2thu milks the Earth.%} Pr2thu by the end of his bow
<>put in arrangement at one place the thousands of
<>mountains which were lying scattered over the country.
<>The grounds were not even and so there were formerly
<>no divisions into villages and towns. There were no
<>grain-plants like paddy or wheat, no agriculture, no
<>cow-protection and no trade. It was since the time of
<>Pr2thu that all these came into being. People desired
<>to live in places where the grounds were even. Then
<>the people lived on fruits, leaves and roots. When they
<>were all destroyed people found it difficult to live.
<NI>Therefore Pr2thu making Sva1yambhuva Manu as calf
<>milked for the welfare of his people all plants from the
<>earth. People do live even today by what was milked
<>then. Pr2thu, because he gave life to Bhu1midevi1,
<>became her father and she got the name Pr2thvi1.
<NI>The brahmin sages milked the cow of earth again.
<>Then Agastya became the calf and Br2haspati milked.
<>When the planets milked, Candra became the calf and [Page609-b+ 65]
<>again Br2haspati milked. The devas even now feed on
<>the U1rjjaks2i1ra (milk rich in food value) they got then.
<>All the animals live because of their virtue and truth.
<>The r2s2is milked truth and virtue. The manes made
<>Yama the calf and Antaka the milker. They milked
<>Svadha1 in a silver pot. The cobras and serpents
<>making Taks2aka the calf milked poison making
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the milker. They live by their poison
<>which is their great defence also. The daityas and
<>da1navas using Virocana as calf and making the two-
<>headed R2tvik Madhu as the milker milked jointly
<>courage, valour and the sarvas4atruvina1s4ini1 ma1ya1
<>(ma1ya1, the destroyer of all enemies). They milked in
<>an iron pot. All their knowledge, bodily health,
<>strength, vigour, brilliance and valour are made from
<>this and that is why they are adepts in the art of
<>ma1ya1 even now.
<NI>Yaks2as milked in an iron pot milk that disappeared
<>from the earth. Rajatana1bha milked using Vais4ravan2a
<>as calf. That Yaks2ara1japutra was sarvajn5a (knowing
<>all) and Sarvadharmajn5a (conversant with all charitable
<>things) with two heads and eight hands. The ra1ks2asas,
<>pis4a1cas and wicked maruts using Rajatana1bha as milker
<>and Suma1li1 as the calf milked blood in a pot made of a
<>skull. They live on this.
<NI>The Gandharvas and nymphs using lotus as their pot,
<>Suruci as milker and Citraratha as calf milked music
<>from her. The mountains making Maha1meru as milker
<>and Hima1layas as the calf milked diamonds and
<>medicines. The sacred trees made Sa1la the milker and
<>plaks2a the calf and milked in a pot of pala1s4a Chinna-
<>dagdhaprarohan2a (the power of growing again even
<>if cut or burnt). The siddhaguhyakaca1ran2avidya1dharas
<>also milked her each using different pots, calves and
<>milkers and they all got what they wanted.
<NI>6). {%As4vamedha.%} Pr2thu's land became rich and
<>prosperous. Then he performed an As4vamedha. The
<>Ya1ga horse was led by Vijita1s4va, son of Pr2thu. Indra
<>did not like Pr2thu conducting the ya1ga. Indra hid at
<>a place on the path of the ya1ga horse. The sage Atri
<>helped Indra. Indra bound the horse and a fight
<>ensued between Indra and Vijita1s4va in which Indra
<>was deplorably defeated and confessing his guilt he
<>craved for pardon and Pr2thu granting him pardon
<>became his great friend. (4th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>7) {%Pr2thu's rule.%} In the history of Bha1rata the period
<>of Pr2thu's rule is considered a golden period. When
<>Pr2thu became the emperor, Brahma1 divided the uni-
<>verse into several kingdoms and made a separate ruler
<>for each of them. Soma was appointed King of the
<>stars, planets, brahmins, plants, ya1gas and austerities.
<>He appointed Kubera as the lord of Kings, Varun2a as
<>the lord of all waters, Vis2n2u, as the lord of all a1dityas
<>and Pa1vaka as the lord of all Vasus. Daks2a was given
<>lordship over praja1patis, Indra over maruts, and
<>Prahla1da over all daityas and da1navas. Yama, the
<>Dharmara1ja was made lord of the manes. Aira1vata
<>was made King of all elephants and Garud2a King of
<>all birds. Uccais4s4ravas was made King of all horses
<>and Vr2s2abha of all cattle. The lion was made King of
<>all beasts and Himava1n the lord of all immovable
<>things. Kapila became chief of all sages and the tiger
<>the leader of all beasts with nails and snouts. Plaks2a
<>was made the King of all trees.
<NI>After distributing kingdoms thus, Brahma1 appointed [Page610-a+ 64]
<>Dikpa1lakas (guardians of the zones). In the east he
<>posted Sudhanva1, son of Vaira1japraja1pati, in the
<>south he posted S4an3khapa1da son of Kardamapraja1pati,
<>in the west he put Ketuma1n, son of Rajas and in the
<>north Hiran2yaroma1. Thus Brahma1 organised a
<>universe with suitable emperors to control and super-
<>vise. (Chapter 22, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>8) {%The end of Pr2thu.%} After several years of benign
<>rule Pr2thu became old. He then entrusted the affairs
<>of the state to his son Vijita1s4va and left for penance
<>with his wife Arccis. After doing severe penance for
<>a long time he merged with Parabrahman. Arccis who
<>was all along serving her husband with devotion
<>ended her life by jumping into the funeral pyre of her
<>husband following her husband like Laks2mi1 following
<>Vis2n2u.
<NI>9) {%Pr2thu's sons.%} Pr2thu had five sons named Vijita1s4va,
<>Haryaks2a, Dhu1mrakes4a, Vr2ka and Dravin2a.
<>The eldest of these Vijita1s4va, with the help of his
<>brothers ruled the country. Haryaks2a ruled over the
<>east, Dhu1mrakes4a over the south, Vr2ka, west and
<>Dravin2a, north. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>PR2THU II. A virtuous brahmin of good conduct.
<>Once when Pr2thu was travelling he met five ugly
<>devils. They became devils for their sins of not doing
<>any charity and behaving rudely with beggars. Pr2thu
<>gave them advice on a1ha1ra (food), a1ca1ra (conduct)
<>and vrata (vow) so that they might get salvation from
<>their devil-lives. (Chapter 27, Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>PR2THU1DAKA. A sacred pond on the borders of
<>Kuruks2etra. This is one of the celebrated ti1rthas of
<>Bha1rata. He who bathes in this pond would get the
<>benefit of doing an as4vamedha. (Chapter 83, Vana
<>Parva; Chapter 39, S4alya Parva).
<HI>PR2THU1DARA. A celebrated Yaks2a. This Yaks2a got a
<>daughter named Sauda1mini1. Her father took her to
<>different mountains to entertain her. One day while
<>she was playing with her companion Kapis4abhru1 she
<>met a Yaksaputra named At2t2aha1sa. They fell in love
<>and Sauda1mini1's father agreed to their marriage and
<>fixed it. After fixing the marriage Pr2thu1dara took his
<>daughter to his house. Next day her companion Kapi-
<>s4abhru1 came to Sauda1mini1 in a sorrowful mood and
<>when she asked her the reason she said “Friend, how
<>am I to report to you this sad news. On my way to you
<>I passed through a garden named Citrasthala in the
<>valley of the Hima1layas. To have some sport with the
<>love-stricken At2t2aha1sa his friends staged a drama in
<>which At2t2aha1sa was made Vais4ravan2ara1ja and his brother
<>Di1ptas4ikha, Nalaku1bara, and the rest, his ministers.
<>They were thus acting and enjoying when Nalaku1bara
<>himself came that way and seeing his servant
<>At2t2aha1sa in the robes and form of his father was
<>angry and calling At2t2aha1sa to his side said: “A servant
<>like you is ambitious of becoming a king. Let this ambi-
<>tion be the cause of your downfall. You will be born
<>as man.” At2t2aha1sa was shocked and he craved pardon
<>“Oh Lord, I did this only for some entertainment. I did
<>not do it with any desire for a big position. Pardon
<>me for my mistake. Nalaku1bara then by his divine
<>power understood everything and taking pity on him
<>consoled him and said “She with whom you are in love
<>will be your wife in your life as man. Your brother [Page610-b+ 64]
<>Di1ptas4ikha will then be born as your son. Both of
<>you will then be released from the curse. Di1ptas4ikha
<>after ruling the country for some time will also be free
<>from this curse.” At2t2aha1sa and Di1ptas4ikha soon dis-
<>appeared by the power of the curse.
<NI>At2t2aha1sa was born as king of Trigartta in the name of
<>Pavitradhara and Sauda1mini1 became his wife. A son
<>was born to them named Di1ptas4ikha and as soon as he
<>was born the parents were released from the curse and
<>entered heaven. (S4as4a1n3kavati1lambaka, Katha1sarit-
<>sa1gara, Taran3ga 6).
<HI>PR2THUDARBHA. A king of the race of An3ga. (Chap-
<>ter 277, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>PR2THUGRI1VA. When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were
<>staying in Pan5cavat2i1 a demoness named S4u1rpan2akha1
<>made approaches to them and Laks2man2a cut off her
<>limbs and sent her away. Then a ra1ks2asa army came
<>under the leadership of Khara, Du1s2an2a and Tris4iras and
<>Pr2thugri1va was one of the twelve prominent soldiers of
<>that army.
<NI>(Sarga 26, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>PR2THUKA. A devagan2a of Raivata Manvantara.
<HI>PR2THULA1KS2A. A King born of the race of An3ga. This
<>king lived in the court of Yama and worshipped him.
<>(S4loka 22, Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>PR2THULA1S4VA. A king of the race of Iks2va1ku. He
<>was the son of Pr2thu and father of Adra. (Chapter 1,
<>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).
<HI>PR2THURAS4MI. One of those who are named ‘Yati’.
<>The Yatis were a people of anti-yajn5a feelings and
<>were all burnt to death in Indra's fire of wrath. But
<>three yatis, Br2hadgiri, Rayova1ja and Pr2thuras4mi were
<>taken care of by Indra and Indra taught them Brahma-
<>vidya1, Ks2atriyavidya1 and Vais4yavidya1.
<NI>Pr2thuras4mi compelled Indra to grant him Ks2a1tratejas
<>also along with Ks2a1travidya1. There is now a sa1ma even
<>in the name of Pr2thuras4mi. (Pan5ca-vim3s4a-Bra1hman2a).
<HI>PR2THUS2EN2A. A King of ancient Bha1rata. (5th
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>PR2THUS4RAVAS I. A King of R2gveda times. Indra
<>killed the enemies of this King. (Su1kta 116, Anuva1ka

<>Vana Parva).
<HI>PR2THUS4RAVAS IV. A soldier of Subrahman2ya
<>(Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>PR2TUS4RAVAS V. A serpent. This serpent was present

<HI>PR2THVI1RU1PA. A beautiful king of a country called
<>Pratis2t2ha1na. Once three wise yogins came to him and
<>said “Oh King, we have travelled round the world.
<>There is a princess in Muktidvi1pa called Ru1palata1. In
<>beauty she will be a good match for you.” On hearing
<>this Pr2thvi1ru1pa calling the court artist Kuma1radatta to
<>his side said “Paint a picture of mine and go along with [Page611-a+ 64]
<>these three sannya1sins to Muktidvi1pa and give the
<>painting in private to the princess there and also bring
<>me an exact painting of hers.”
<NI>The painter went to Muktidvi1pa and the King coming
<>to know of the talents of the artist Kuma1radatta com-
<>missioned him to paint a picture of his daughter
<>Ru1palata1. He did the work beautifully. The King was
<>immensely pleased and he enquired if Kuma1radatta
<>had seen a suitable prince for Ru1palata1. Kuma1radatta
<>immediately showed him the portrait of Pr2thvi1ru1pa.
<>The king found the prince extremely suitable and en-
<>trusted the artist himself with the task of negotiating the
<>marriage with Pr2thvi1ru1pa. Kuma1radatta returned to
<>his King with the portrait of Ru1palata1 and Pr2thvi1ru1pa
<>was infatuated with the dazzling beauty of Ru1palata1.
<>Before long the marriage of Pr2thvi1ru1pa with Ru1palata1
<>was conducted in all grandeur. (Alan3ka1ravati1lambaka,
<>Katha1saritsa1gara, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>PR2THVI1TI1RTHA. A sacred pond on the borders of
<>Kuruks2etra. He who bathes in this pond would get
<>the benefit of doing a sahasragoda1na (giving away as
<>gift a thousand cows). (S4loka 13, Chapter 83, Vana
<>Parva).
<HI>PUCCHA1N2D2AKA. A serpent of the family of Taks2aka.
<>This serpent was burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
<>Janamejaya. (S4loka 8, Chapter 57, A1di Parva).
<HI>PU1JANI1. A bird of superior intellect. The story of
<>Pu1jani1 was told by Bhi1s2ma to illustrate that Ks2atriyas
<>can never be believed.
<NI>There was once a king called Brahmadatta in the coun-
<>try of Ka1mpilya. The King had a bird named Pu1jani1.
<>Pu1jani1 was very intelligent and all-knowing and the king
<>treated her as his friend. Days went by and one day the
<>queen delivered a son. At the same time Pu1jani1 also
<>got a child. The prince and the little bird grew up as
<>great friends. The little bird used to bring to the prince
<>whatever eatable it could take in its little beak. They lived
<>as such thick chums.
<NI>One day while Pu1jani1 was away from the cage, the
<>prince caught hold of the little bird and strangled it
<>to death. When Pu1jani1 came back she found her child
<>missing and went about crying loudly. She then knew
<>what had happened and got very angry. She flew and
<>pricked blind the eyes of the prince and bade farewell
<>to the King. The parting scene was very pathetic.
<>Pu1jani1 declared that Ks2atriyas were not to be believed
<>and flew away. (Chapter 139, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PU1JA1VIDHI. Chapter 155 of Agni Pura1n2a states the
<>various acts of worship that should be done daily
<>and they are the acts of worship observed by all
<>brahmaca1rins during the time of Manusmr2ti.
<NI>You should rise up at Bra1hmamuhu1rta. Finish your ex-
<>cretory routine sitting facing north during daytime and
<>facing south during night time. If it is at dusk or dawn
<>it should be done as during day time. It should never
<>be done in public roads, water or grass. Wash with
<>sand after your excretions and then wash your teeth.
<>After that take your bath. Baths are of six kinds: Nitya-
<>sna1na, Naimittikasna1na, Ka1myasna1na, Kriya1n3gasna1na,
<>Malakars2an2asna1na and Kriya1sna1na. Any religious act
<>done without a bath is of no use. Therefore you should
<>bathe early. Well-water is good for bathing, water from
<>a fountain is better, water of a lake is much better,
<>river-water is still better and water of a ti1rtha [Page611-b+ 65]
<>is still better. The water of the river Gan3ga1 is the
<>best.
<NI>After washing after excretions you should enter into
<>the waters and wash again and then wash your body.
<>While washing you should recite the following mantras
<>“Hiran2yavarn2ah2, S4anno devi1h2, a1po hi s2t2ha1 and idam-
<>a1pah2.” You should submerge yourself in the waters and
<>recite the mantras there under the water. You should
<>also recite Aghamars2an2a su1kta or the R2k named
<>Drupada. Ga1yatri1 should be chanted specially. After
<>the Japa you should rub dry with a cloth your head
<>and body and then offer water to the devas and manes.
<>Then you should worship with water reciting Purus2a-
<>su1kta.
<NI>You should give way to anybody carrying a load, a
<>pregnant woman and preceptors. Never look at the
<>Sun at the time of rising or setting. Never look at the
<>reflection of the moon in waters. Never look at a nude
<>woman. Do not peep into a well. Never trample over
<>clothes and sacred ashes. Never enter the bedroom or
<>the treasure room of another man. Those who rub mud
<>blocks against mud block, cut their teeth or bite their
<>nails will perish. Never enter a house through any
<>other opening than its proper gate. Never interrupt
<>when others are talking. Never use the clothes of ano-
<>ther man. Tell everybody ‘Bhadram’ ‘Bhadram’ (well
<>well). Never speak to displease anybody. Never walk
<>on the shadow of an individual. Do not pass through
<>the space between two respectable persons sitting and
<>talking. Do not look at falling stars. Never mention
<>the name of another river while in a river. Do not
<>scratch your body with both your hands. Never cross a
<>river before offering water to the devas and manes. Do
<>not throw your excretions into the waters. Never
<>bathe naked. After bath you should pray to gods for
<>your welfare. Never take out a garland from your body
<>by yourself. Avoid dust from the hooves of donkeys
<>sticking to your body. Never laugh at low-caste people,
<>nor live with them nor live in their places. Never live
<>in a place where there are no rivers, doctors or a king.
<>Nor live in a place ruled by barbarous people or a
<>woman or by a number of people together. Never
<>talk with women during their period of menses. If you

<>a nearby hillock the sage Tr2n2abindu was also doing
<>penance. Celestial maidens, Na1ga maidens and their
<>lovers came to the a1s4rama and by their erotic sports
<>and dances vitiated the precincts of the a1s4rama. Pulastya
<>got angry and cursed all the maidens to become preg-
<>nant if they entered the a1s4rama area. Without know-

<>Tasma1t putra iti proktah2
<>Svayameva svayambhuva1 //</Poem>
<>(S4loka 138, Chapter 9, Manusmr2ti).
<NI>(Because a son of his own, by birth, saves a father from
<>the hell called ‘Put’ he is called Putra).
<NI>There are twelve different kinds of ‘Putras’ (sons).
<NI>1) {%Aurasaputra.%} A son born to a wife of his own caste
<>begot by the husband himself is called aurasaputra.
<NI>2) {%Ks2etrajaputra.%} If one dies without children or is
<>impotent or possessed of a disease, his wife is lawfully
<>allowed to lie with the brother of the husband to get a
<>child. The son born of such a union is called
<>Ks2etrajaputra.
<NI>3) {%Dattaputra.%} When one is worrying miserably for get-
<>ting a son and if at that time a husband and wife will-
<>ingly hand over a son born to them by mutual consent
<>with the following words: “This son becomes your own
<>from now” with a religious sprinkling of water, such a
<>son is called Dattaputra.
<NI>4) {%Kr2trimaputra.%} A son adopted from one's own caste
<>for the purpose of doing the obsequial ceremonies for
<>the manes is called Kr2trimaputra. [Page613-b+ 65]
<NI>5) {%Gu1d2hotpanna.%} A son born to one's wife by another
<>man is called Gu1d2hotpanna.
<NI>6) {%Apaviddhaputra.%} When a son is rejected by either a
<>father or mother or by both and that son is taken care
<>of and brought up by another man, that son becomes
<>an apaviddhaputra.
<NI>7) {%Ka1ni1naputra.%} If a son is born to a virgin before
<>marriage while living with her father, that son is called
<>a Ka1ni1naputra.
<NI>8) {%Sahod2haputra.%} When a girl is married while preg-
<>nant the son born to her after marriage is called a
<>Sahod2haputra.
<NI>9) {%Kri1takaputra.%} A son purchased and brought up by
<>a sonless man is called Kri1takaputra.
<NI>10) {%Paunarbhavaputra.%} A son born to a woman after
<>becoming a widow or after being divorced by her
<>husband by her willingly going with another man is
<>called a Paunarbhavaputra.
<NI>11) {%Svayam3dattaputra.%} When a son after becoming an
<>orphan or after being abandoned by his parents goes
<>willingly to another man and remains with him as
<>his son, that son is called Svayam3dattaputra.
<NI>12) {%S4audra (Pa1ras4ava) Putra.%} A son born to a brahmin
<>of a S4u1dra wife.
<HI>PUNARJANMA. It is the theory that the soul of a man
<>is born again after his death. The Pura1n2as and Vedas
<>contain many statements regarding this of which the
<>following are a few:
<NI>1) {%What is Death?%} When the Ji1va1tma1 (soul) of an
<>individual leaves his body with all its upa1dhis (attri-
<>butes and adjuncts) it is called Death. By upa1dhis are
<>meant the following four things. (i) Mind and the senses.
<NI>(ii) The five Pra1n2as namely Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Uda1na, Vya1na
<>and Sama1na. (iii) The Su1ks2mas4ari1ra, that is, the Pra1n2a-
<>manovijn5a1nakos4asan3gha1ta (the subtle body that is invi-
<>sible with the grosser elements). (iv) Karman (action).
<>All these four things follow the soul even after his death.
<>Only when the soul attains moks2a (salvation) do the
<>upa1dhis leave it. It is the life breath Uda1na that guides
<>the soul out of the body. It is the Su1ks2mas4ari1ra that
<>gives heat to the body while there is life and that is
<>why when the soul leaves the body with the upa1dhis the
<>body becomes cold.
<NI>2) {%After death.%} When the soul leaves the body with the
<>upa1dhis it becomes active again and its activities and
<>movements depend upon the actions of the soul while
<>living. The spiritual actions of the individual are
<>classified into three.
<NI>(i) {%Aparabrahmopa1sana.%} He who has done all his deeds
<>according to scriptural injunctions is said to be one who
<>has done upa1sana of aparabrahma. When such an
<>individual dies his soul with all the upa1dhis attains
<>Candra. He goes to Candra through dhu1ma (smoke),
<>ra1tri (night), Kr2s2n2apaks2a (the dark fortnight), daks2in2a1-
<>yanaka1la (the sun's passage south of the equator),
<>pitr2loka (world of the manes) and A1ka1s4a (ether). He
<>enjoys the rewards of the deeds done on earth there
<>and reserving some to be enjoyed or suffered in his
<>next birth the soul with the upa1dhis comes back to
<>earth to enter another body. The soul comes back to
<>earth through ether, va1yu, dhu1ma, megha, vars2a, vri1hi,
<>yava, aus2adhi, vr2ks2a, Tila, Purus2abi1ja and stri1garbha.
<>When the Ji1va1tma1 goes to Candra its pada1rthatva
<>(attribute) diminishes gradually and when it comes back
<>to earth it increases gradually. Thus the ji1va1tma1 takes [Page614-a+ 64]
<>thousands of births going to and from the moon. The
<>ji1va1tma1 coming back from the moon evolves from a
<>plant to man. Plants are the food of man and the soul
<>entering the plant enters the purus2abi1ja (semen virile)
<>through food. The souls coming out as rebirths do
<>accept wombs according to a definite principle. In
<>the order of the merit of their good deeds on earth
<>they are born in Brahmin, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya or S4u1dra
<>wombs. The souls with great sins are born as worms and
<>insects. This passage of the soul from earth to Candra
<>and vice versa is called Pitr2ya1na.
<NI>(ii) {%Aparavidyopa1sana.%} There are some people who do
<>not consider performance of religious rites as important
<>but worship Brahman. They do not treat Brahman and
<>ji1va1tma1 as one but view them as separate entities.
<>Such devotees are called Aparavidyopa1sakas. Their souls
<>as soon as they leave the body move towards apara-
<>brahman. The path to aparabrahma is through Agni,
<>Jyotis, daytime, S4uklapaks2a (the white fortnight),
<>Uttara1yan2a (the passage of the sun to the north), samvat-
<>sara (year), Su1rya (sun), Candra (moon) and Vidyut
<>(lightning). The dhanyas (blessed ones) who attain
<>Vidyut go to Varun2aloka, Indraloka and Praja1patiloka
<>and then merge with parabrahma (the supreme being).
<>This path is called Devaya1na. Since for both Pitr2ya1na
<>and Devaya1na the ji1va1tma1 has to depend upon Candra
<>it is to be surmised that there is some special connection
<>between ji1va1tma1 and Candra. Those who attain Apara-
<>brahma by the path of devaya1na do not come back to
<>earth. They have no rebirths. Those who have merged
<>with aparabrahma attain Brahman by the end of a life-
<>time of Brahma1. Thus those who attain Brahman and
<>do not believe that ji1va1tma1 and Brahman are one
<>and view them separately attain Parabrahma through
<>the merger with aparabrahma. This is called Krama-
<>mukti. Some sages are of opinion that those who attain
<>aparabrahma enjoy prosperity by mind. Those who
<>live attached to worldly pleasures but not do things
<>prohibited by the Vedas attain Pitr2loka by the path of
<>Daks2in2a1yana. After enjoying all the accrued ‘pun2ya’
<>there, they come back again to earth to be born
<>again.
<NI>(iii) {%Pa1popa1sana.%} The ji1va1tma1 of one who does not
<>follow the injunctions of s4a1stras correctly does not
<>attain Candraloka. It is born again as pests and insects
<>attaining a place called Tr2ti1ya. There is no evidence
<>in the Pura1n2as of their attaining moks2a. How
<>a soul subjected to rebirths attains moks2a is described
<>under ‘Moks2a’. (Cha1ndogya Upanis2ad, Gi1ta1, Bha1ga-
<>vata, S4veta1s4vatara Upanis2ad).
<HI>PUNARVASU A1TREYA. An ancient preceptor of
<>A1yurveda. He was the Guru of Agnideva author of
<>the book ‘Agnives4atantra’ which is the basis of Caraka-
<>sam3hita1 and also of his classmates like Bhela.
<NI>Punarvasu was the son of the sage Atri who was one
<>of the spiritual sons of Brahma1. In support of this
<>statement it can be found in many places in Caraku
<>sam3hita1 his name referred to as ‘Atrisuta’ or Atri-
<>nandana’.
<NI>Atri mahars2i was also a learned preceptor of A1yurveda
<>According to Kas4yapasam3hita1 Devendra taught A1yur
<>veda to Kas4yapa, Vas2is2t2ha, Atri and Bhr2gu. The in-
<>complete work ‘A1yurvedacikitsa1tantra’ by Atri was
<>completed by Punarvasu according to As4vaghos2a. [Page614-b+ 65]
<>Punurvasu's mother's name was Candrabha1ga1. Getting
<>knowledge in A1yurveda from his father and also from
<>Bharadva1ja, Punarvasu became an authority on A1yur-
<>veda. His important work is ‘A1treyasam3hita1’. There are
<>about thirty prescriptions in his name. The prescriptions
<>regarding ‘Bala1taila’ and ‘Amr2ta1ditaila’ are found in
<>Carakasam3hita1.
<HI>PUNAS4CANDRA. A sacred place. This is situated in
<>the Jamadagnivedi1 in S4u1rpa1rakaks2etra. (S4loka 12,
<>Chapter 88, Vana Parva).
<HI>PUN5CU. A King of Su1ryavam3s4a (solar race). He was
<>the son of Harita and father of Vijaya. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 1).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA I. A King born of the race of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>He was the son of Nis2adha and father of Ks2emadhanva1.
<>(9th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA II. One of the As2t2adiggajas (elephants
<>guarding the eight zones). (See under As2t2adiggajas).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA III. A brahmin who lived during the
<>period of Na1rada. Na1rada once held a scholarly con-
<>versation with him on virtue. He saw Maha1vis2n2u in
<>person and attained sa1yujya (intimate union with a
<>deity). (Chapter 124, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA IV. A great yajn5a. (S4loka 100, Chapter 5,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA V. A holy place situated on the border
<>of Kuruks2etra. One who bathes in a sacred pond
<>there would get the benefit of doing a Pun2d2ari1kayajn5a.
<>(S4loka 83, Chapter 83, Vana Parva).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KA1. VI. A nymph. This maiden was present
<>for the Janmotsava of Arjuna and performed a dance
<>then. (S4loka 13, Chapter 122, A1di Parva).
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1KAMUKHA. An eminent serpent King. His
<>subjects, Pun2d2ari1kamukhas, lived with him in the
<>beautiful serpent-city surrounded on all sides by gold
<>castles. Gandharvas and Kinnaras of both sexes lived
<>inside the city. A Gandharva of name Lalita fell in
<>love with a Gandharva lady named Lalita1 and they
<>lived there happily enjoying amorous sports. One day
<>Pun2d2ari1kamukha held a music concert in which Lalita
<>was asked to sing as the leading musician. His love
<>Lalita1 was absent at the assembly and Lalita could
<>not sing or dance in proper form that day. Karkat2aka,
<>a serpent chief, privately informed his King the reason
<>for the poor display of Lalita that day. The King got
<>angry and cursed Lalita thus: “Wicked one, you will
<>be born as a man-eating ra1ks2asa. This is the penalty
<>for thinking about your wife while singing for me.”
<NI>Lalita immediately became an ugly, fierce-looking
<>demon. Lalita1 deeply mourned over this pitiable plight
<>of her husband and followed him in the forests where
<>he roamed about making loud roaring sounds. While
<>they were thus wandering in the forests, they found a
<>pretty a1s4rama in which there was an ascetic engaged
<>in penance. Lalita1 stood before him with tears rolling
<>down her cheeks. When the sage opened his eyes
<>Lalita1 told him that she was the daughter of the
<>Gandharva named Vi1radhanva1 and that her husband
<>had become a demon by the curse of the serpent King
<>Pun2d2ari1kamukha. The sage advised her to observe
<>Eka1das4i1 Vrata. She observed the Vrata with devotion
<>and her husband Lalita, was freed from the curse. He
<>became the former handsome Gandharva once again.
<>They then went back to Gandharvaloka. (Chapter 49,
<>Bha1ga 4, Padma Pura1n2a). [Page615-a+ 65]
<HI>PUN2D2ARI1YAKA. A Vis4vadeva. (Chapter 91, Anus4a1-

<HI>PUN2D2RA I. An ancient King in Bha1rata. (S4loka 224,
<>Chapter 1, A1di Parva).
<HI>PUN2D2RA II. An ancient region of Bha1rata. The
<>region comprised then the present district of Ma1lada,
<>certain portions on the east coast of river Kosi1 and
<>certain portions of Dina1jpur. King Pa1n2d2u conquered
<>Pun2d2ra. (Chapter 112, A1di Parva). The people of
<>Pun2d2ra came to the Ra1jasu1ya of Yudhis2t2hira with
<>presents. The Paun2d2rakava1sudeva mentioned in the
<>Bha1gavata was the King of Pun2d2ra. Karn2a and
<>Arjuna conquered this country at different times.
<>(Chapter 52, Sabha1 Parva; Chapter 8, Karn2a Parva;
<>Chapter 82, A1s4vamedhika Parva).
<HI>PUN5JIKASTHALA1. A nymph. She was the servant-
<>maid of Br2haspati. One day she was collecting flowers
<>for her Guru in a garden when a set of young men
<>and women came to the garden for amorous sports.
<>They were roaming about in the garden in pairs doing
<>all sorts of erotic acts and Pun5jikasthala1 stood watching
<>them for some time with passion aroused in her. She
<>returned to the a1s4rama thinking all the way about her
<>miserable lot of having no husband to enjoy a similar
<>life. She was full of lust when she returned to the
<>a1s4rama and on seeing Br2haspati she caught hold of him
<>by the hand and pleaded to satisfy her passion.
<>Br2haspati was angry at this improper request and
<>cursed her “You have become rotten. You have be-
<>come lustful by seeing the amorous sports of others.
<>May you be born as a monkey. Get out of this a1s4rama.”
<>Pun5jikasthala1 came to her senses and regretting her
<>hasty act begged her Guru to grant her release from

<>enjoy to your full sexual life with a lover whom you
<>like best. Then you will get a son from the vitality of
<>S4iva. When that son is born you will be released from
<>the curse and you will go to heaven.”
<NI>She became immediately a monkey girl named An5jana1
<>and started living in a forest of that name itself. She
<>fell in love with a monkey boy named Kesari1 there and
<>lived for many years enjoying an amorous life. She did
<>not get a child even after several years and then she
<>prayed to S4iva for a child.
<NI>It was at that time that Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara
<>played amorous sports in the form of monkeys and
<>Pa1rvati1 became pregnant. Pa1rvati1 expressed reluctance
<>to be the mother of a monkey child and then S4iva by
<>his divine powers deposited his semen virile through
<>Va1yubhagava1n (god of wind) into the womb of
<>An5jana1 who was then praying to him for a child.

<HI>PU1NTA1NAM NAMBU1TIRI.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The illam (house) of this
<>Nambu1tiri who was a contemporary of Meppattu1r
<>Na1ra1yan2a Bhat2t2atiri was in Nenmeni am3s4a of the taluk
<>of Valluvana1d2u in south Malabar. Though some say
<>that his original name was Brahmadatta there are no
<>sufficient records to support the statement. His Guru
<>according to the work ‘S4ri1 Kr2s2n2akarn2a1mr2ta’ was a
<>nambu1tiri named Ni1lakan2t2ha. Pu1nta1nam had only
<>ordinary education. He worshipped Kr2s2n2a at the temple
<>of Guruva1yu1r for a very long time and became a great
<>devotee of Kr2s2n2a. He lived for ninety years. When he
<>became very old he found it difficult to come to
<>Guruva1yu1r for worship and so one day he bade farewell
<>to the deity. Then a voice from heaven said “Do not
<>worry. I will be near you on your left side.” He went
<>and sat on a hill named Tiruma1ndha and to his astonish-
<>ing ecstasy he found Kr2s2n2a sitting on his left side. He
<>then constructed a temple there and installed his deity
<>Kr2s2n2a there and continued his worship. That was the
<>Va1mapura (left place) of Pu1nta1nam.

<NI>3) {%Jn5a1nappa1na.%} Pu1nta1nam got a son after a long time
<>of prayer and for the ceremony of Annapra1s4ana (feed-
<>ing rice for the first time) all the people of his commu-
<>nity were invited. The women who came for the
<>function threw their upper garments on to the cradle
<>where the little child was suffocated to death. Pu1nta1nam
<>thereafter became disgusted with life and Jn5a1nappa1na
<>was written at that time.
<NI>4) {%Santa1nagopa1lam.%} Pu1nta1nam spent most of his time
<>in the temple of Guruva1yu1r after the death of his child.
<>It was at this same time that the great scholar Na1ra1-
<>yan2abhat2t2atiri, author of the famous Na1ra1yan2i1ya, was
<>in the temple worshipping the deity there. Pu1nta1nam
<>had written a poem ‘Santa1nagopa1lam’ in the pa1na style
<>and he took it to the great pandit Na1ra1yan2a Bhat2t2atiri
<>for correction. With the haughtiness that was his trait he
<>said “What is there for correction in a Malaya1lam
<>poem? Nothing but blunders will there be in it. Espe-
<>cialy when Pu1nta1nam is not well-versed in Sanskrit
<>grammar. It will therefore be full of mistakes.” Pu1nta1-
<>nam could not contain the rebuff and he wept bitterly.
<>Then from the inside of the temple came a voice which
<>said “Though Pu1nta1nam is not a grammarian like you
<>Bhat2t2atiri, he is a greater devotee of mine than you.
<>His Bhakti is more appealing to me than your vibhakti.”
<>The divine voice made Bhat2t2atiri feel sorry and ashamed
<>of his behaviour and he begged Pu1nta1nam to grant him [Page616-a+ 65]
<>pardon and immediately went through his work giving
<>suggestions for improvement.
<HI>PUN2YA I Son of the sage Di1rghatamas. The story of
<>Pun2ya as found in Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha is the following:--
<>There is a mountain called Mahendra in Jambu1dvi1pa.
<>Di1rghatamas who was doing penance there had two
<>sons named Pun2ya and Pa1vana. Pun2yakuma1ra grew
<>up into a boy abounding in virtues. Pa1vana was not
<>so broad-minded. When after some time Di1rghatamas,
<>their father died, Pun2yakuma1ra controlling his sorrow
<>did all the funeral rites; but Pa1vana unable to control
<>his sorrow left the place and wandered in the forests weep-
<>ing bitterly. After some days Pun2yakuma1ra went in
<>search of his brother and on finding him consoled him
<>and told him that there was nothing to be worried ab-
<>out their father's death. On hearing the learned
<>and moral teachings of Pun2ya, Pa1vana also got en-
<>lightened and after living in that forest for a number of
<>years both of them abandoned their lives.
<HI>PUN2YA II The name of the a1s4rama of the sage
<>Vibha1n2d2aka. (S4loka 23, Chapter 110, Vana Parva).
<HI>PUN2YAJANA. A ra1ks2asa. Raivata, king of Kus4asthali1,
<>born of the race of S4arya1ti, went to see Brahma1. Taking
<>advantage of his absence from the place Pun2yajana
<>took control over Kus4asthali1. Afraid of the demon all
<>the hundred brothers of Raivata left the country. After
<>some time the S4arya1ti dynasty merged with that of
<>Hehaya. (Chapter 2, Am3s4a 4, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>PUN2YAJANI1. Wife of Man2ibhadra, one of the S4ivapa1rs2a-

<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>PUN2YANA1MA1. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (Chapter
<>45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>PUN2YANIDHI. A king of the lunar race. The King
<>was a great devotee of Vis2n2u and he went to Ra1mes4vara
<>to do worship of Vis2n2u there. Pleased with the pure
<>devotion of the king Maha1vis2n2u started living at Ra1me-
<>s4vara under the name of Setuma1dhava. (Chapter 3,
<>Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>PUN2YAS4I1LA. A brahmin who was residing on the banks
<>of the river Goda1vari1. Once Pun2yas4i1la engaged a
<>brahmin widower for officiating in a S4ra1ddha ceremony.
<>As a result of that sin Pun2yas4i1la's face became that of
<>a donkey. To be freed from the sin he went and

<>janya. Indra once became the son of this Purandara.
<>(S4loka 3, Chapter 221, Vana Parva). [Page616-b+ 65]
<HI>PURANDARA III. The name of Indra in Vaivasvata
<>Manvantara. (See under Manvantara). In Matsya
<>Pura1n2a Purandara has been considered to be one among

<NI>According to Maha1bha1rata Lord S4iva wrote a book
<>“Vais4a1la1ks2a” containing ten thousand chapters dealing
<>with Dharma1rthaka1mas. Purandara condensed it into
<>a book of five thousand chapters called ‘Ba1hudantaka.’
<>Purandara gave that book that name in honour of his
<>mother who was called Ba1hudanti1. (Chapters 59, 89
<>and 90, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PURAN5JANA. A king. The story of this king was told to
<>king Pra1ci1nabarhis by Na1rada to illustrate the truth
<>that those who kill yajn5a cows on earth would surely
<>suffer its consequences at one time or another.
<NI>Puran5jana once started on a tour after killing a few
<>yajn5a cows. His aim was to build a new palace. After
<>walking alone for a long time he reached the neigh-
<>bourhood of Hima1layas. While wandering in the forests
<>he saw a beautiful garden and by its side a big castle
<>with nine tower-gates. It was the residence of the
<>Gandharva lady Puran5jani1. She had innumerable girl
<>companions and her castle was guarded by a five-hooded
<>cobra called Praja1giri.
<NI>Puran5jani1 fell in love with Puran5jana at first sight
<>and their greetings and subsquent talks ended in their
<>marriage. Thus Puran5jana became the husband of
<>Puran5jani1 and they lived happily an erotic life for a
<>hundred years. Then one day the king went for hunting
<>alone. Even that separation for a little while from
<>Puran5jani1 was unbearable to Puran5jana and he returned
<>to his palace soon. Puran5jani1 did not come to receive
<>him. On enquiry her companions informed the king
<>that Puran5jani1 was lying on the floor with grief unable
<>to bear the separation from the king. Puran5jana con-
<>soled her and they lived again for many years in per-
<>fect happiness. Then one thing happened.
<NI>Ka1la had a daughter named Ka1lakanyaka1 who lived
<>a very wicked and vicious life. She wanted to get marri-
<>ed but nobody wanted to be her husband. S4he went
<>about in search of a husband. Pu1ru became her husband
<>for some time but she was soon divorced by him. She
<>approached a Yavana king named Bhaya who had a
<>brother called Prajvara. Bhaya did not want to take
<>that woman as his wife and so sent her back with a
<>boon that she could stand in hiding and enjoy all
<>men she liked. He sent his brother Prajvara for her
<>help. She roamed about like that for some time and
<>came back again to Bhaya. Ka1lakanyaka1, Bhaya and
<>Prajvara joined together and gathering a strong army
<>attacked Puran5jana. A grim battle followed which
<>lasted for several years in the end of which Puran5jana
<>was defeated and taken captive. While he was being
<>taken as a prisoner a herd of wild cows attacked Pura-
<>n5jana and he was killed. After that he was born as a
<>princess named Vaidarbhi1. Malayadhvaja, king of
<>Pa1n2d2ya, married her and got seven celebrated sons.
<>Agastya married the daughter of Malayadhvaja.

<HI>PURA1N2A.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The Amarakos4a describes a
<>Pura1n2a thus:
<Poem>Sargas4ca pratisargas4ca
<>Vam3s4o manvantara1n2i ca /
<>Vam3s4a1nucaritam3 ca1pi
<>Pura1n2am pan5calaks2an2am //</Poem>
<NI>According to this definition, Pura1n2a is one which des-
<>cribes Sarga, Pratisarga, Vam3s4a, Manvantara and
<>Vam3s4a1nucarita. Among these Sarga and Pratisarga
<>are natural creation and renovation (Cosmogony).
<>Vam3s4a means history of sages and patriarchs. By Man-
<>vantara is meant the period of different Manus. Vam3s4a1-
<>nucarita means Genealogy of kings. In the Pura1n2as
<>which are current now some of these five divisions are
<>wanting.
<NI>Statements about Pura1n2as are found even in the
<>Bra1hman2as. Therefore it is to be surmised that Pura1n2as
<>existed even before historic times. Maha1bha1rata has
<>used the term Pura1n2a to mean stories about devas and
<>siddhas. The Upanis2ads say that Pura1n2as are itiha1sas
<>and as such constitute the fifth Veda. Smr2ti says
<>that Pura1n2as are commentaries on Vedas. From all
<>these statements it can be gathered that Pura1n2as have
<>a hoary past. The great Sanskrit scholar Ran3ga1ca1rya
<>has defined Pura1n2a as Pura1 nava (Pura1=old; nava
<>=new) meaning things which are as good as new
<>though existing from olden times. Though there are
<>large portions of wide imagination dealing with the
<>human side in the Pura1n2as many truths about the
<>universe can be grasped from them. All the Pura1n2as
<>contain praises of Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara. In
<>most of the Pura1n2as of old, new additions and interpo-
<>lations are seen. The Pura1n2as in original were in exis-
<>tence before Christ.

<>(S4loka 70, Chapter 53, Matsya Pura1n2a)
<NI>From the above it can be gathered that it was Vya1sa
<>who composed all the Pura1n2as. Ba1n2a who lived in the
<>seventh century A.D. speaks about Va1yu Pura1n2a. Kuma1-
<>rila Bhat2t2a who lived in the eighth century and S4an3kara1-
<>ca1rya who lived in the ninth century speak about the
<>Pura1n2as. Pura1n2as must have therefore taken their pre-
<>sent forms before the sixth or seventh century A.D.
<NI>There are eighteen major Pura1n2as and another eighteen
<>minor ones. The major Pura1n2as contain over four lakhs
<>of S4lokas. All the Pura1n2as are in verses like Maha1-
<>bha1rata. But none of them is as good as Maha1bha1rata
<>as a piece of literature. Still the Pura1n2as splendidly
<>reflect the culture of Bha1rata. The Pura1n2as are the
<>basis of the bulk of Indian thinking on matters
<>social, cultural, religious and political. Even the Indian
<>art has taken form from the Pura1n2as. The Pura1n2as are
<>classified into three, those pertaining to Brahma1, those
<>pertaining to Vis2n2u and those to S4iva.
<NI>2) {%A. Vis2n2u-based Pura1nas.%} [Page617-b+ 65]
<NI>(i) {%Vis2n2u Pura1n2a.%} This is one of the most important of
<>all the Pura1n2as. This contains the five technical
<>divisions of the Pura1n2as. This is divided into six am3s4as.
<>This deals with the events of Va1ra1hakalpa and contains
<>twentythree thousand s4lokas. The theme is the ten
<>incarnations of Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u Pura1n2a is the most
<>ancient of all the Pura1n2as and has got the name
<>Pura1n2aratna (gem of Pura1n2as).
<NI>The method of narration is in the form of teaching
<>his disciple Maitreya by sage Para1s4ara. Since
<>there is a reference in it to the Maurya dynasty it is to
<>be surmised that this was composed in the first or second
<>century A.D. The narrator himself states thus:--
<>“Vya1sa an adept in the compositon of Pura1n2as composed
<>this Pura1n2asam3hita1 with a1khya1nas, Upa1khya1nas, ga1tha1s
<>and Kalpanirn2ayas. A Su1ta named Romahars2an2a was
<>Vya1sa's chief disciple. The broad-minded Vya1sa gave
<>that sam3hita1 to that su1ta. Romahars2an2a had six dis-
<>ciples named Sumati, Agnivarcas, Mitra1yus. S4a1m3s4apa1-
<>yana, Akr2tavran2a, and Sa1varn2i. Of these Akr2tavran2a,
<>Sa1varn2i and S4a1m3s4apa1yana born in the Kas4yapagotra
<>have composed Pura1n2asam3hita1s. There is yet another
<>sam3hita1 composed by Romahars2an2a which was the basis
<>of the sam3hita1s of his three disciples. I have composed
<>Vis2n2upura1n2a basing on the above four sam3hita1s.”
<NI>If a man gives as gift a book of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a on

<NI>(ii) {%Bha1gavata Pura1n2a.%} This is the most popular and
<>widely circulated of all the Pura1n2as. It is dear to
<>Vis2n2u-devotees. Divided into twelve Skandhas this con-
<>tains eighteen thousand s4lokas. All the incarnations of
<>Vis2n2u are described in this. The most interesting
<>Skandha is the tenth Skandha in which the author has
<>described the life and activities of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. There
<>was once a belief that it was Baladeva who lived in the
<>thirteenth century A.D. that had composed this Pura1n2a.
<>But this belief was smashed when it was found that Valla1-
<>lasena of Bengal who lived in the eleventh century A.D.
<>had made references to this Pura1n2a in some of his works.
<>Bha1gavata accepts Kapila and Buddha as incarnations
<>of Vis2n2u. This has been translated into all Indian
<>languages. This book has to be given as gift on the full-
<>moon day in the month of Pros2t2hapada (September).
<>Agni Pura1n2a instructs that this book is to be given
<>along with a golden image of a lion.
<NI>(iii) {%Na1radi1ya Pura1n2a.%} This is in the form of a

<>day in the month of A1s4vina there will be great pros-
<>perity.
<NI>(iv) {%Garud2a Pura1n2a.%} This is in the form of instructions
<>to Garud2a by Vis2n2u. This deals with astronomy,
<>medicine, grammar, and with the structure and qualities
<>of diamonds. This Pura1n2a is dear to Vais2n2avites. The
<>latter half of this Pura1n2a deals with life after death.
<>The Hindus of north-India generally read this Pura1n2a
<>while cremating the bodies of the dead. This has given
<>great importance to the origin of Garud2a. There are
<>eight thousand verses in this book. This book should be

<>khan2d2a, Svargakhan2d2a, Pa1ta1lakhan2d2a, Uttarakhan2d2a
<>and Kriya1yogasa1ra. The Uttarakhan2d2a describes
<>the importance of all months and also the lotus, the
<>seat of Brahma1. This contains the stories of S4akuntala1
<>and S4ri1 Ra1ma as described by Ka1lida1sa in his works
<>S4a1kuntala and Raghuvam3s4a which has made some
<>believe that this Pura1n2a was written after Ka1lida1sa.

<NI>(vi) {%Vara1ha Pura1n2a.%} The mode of narration is in the
<>form of narrating the story by Vara1ha, the third incar-

<>Maha1vis2n2u and that prayer took the form of a goddess.
<>This book contains fourteen thousand verses. If one
<>copies down this Pura1n2a and gives it as gift along with

<NI>(i) {%Brahma Pura1n2a.%} This is in the form of teachings by
<>Brahma1 to Daks2a. This contains twentyfive thousand
<>verses. This is called A1di Pura1n2a also. There is a special
<>treatise in this book on Orissa, an ancient holy region
<>of Bha1rata. There is in this a special annexure explain-
<>ing the intimacy between S4iva and Su1rya which is a
<>deviation from other Pura1n2as. Brahma Pura1n2a states
<>about a su1ryaks2etra (sun-temple) situated at a place
<>called Kon2a1rka near the holy place of Puri1, installed
<>there in the year 1241 A.D. If this Pura1n2a along with
<>Jaladhenu is given as a gift on the full-moon day in the
<>month of Vais4a1kha (May) the donor will attain heaven.
<NI>(ii) {%Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a.%} This deals with the origin of
<>the universe as told by Brahma1. In the beginning
<>there was a golden egg and the prapan5ca (universe with
<>its activities) was formed out of it. Portions of Adh-
<>ya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a, references to Ra1dha1 and Kr2s2n2a and
<>the incarnation of Paras4ura1ma are included in this.
<>This book contains twelve thousand verses and it is
<>believed to be uttama (best) to give this book as a gift
<>to a brahmin.
<NI>(iii) {%Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a.%} This was instructed to
<>Sa1varn2ika by Na1rada. The theme is the story of
<>Rathantara. There are four ka1n2d2as in this Pura1n2a called
<>Brahmaka1n2d2a, Prakr2tika1n2d2a, Gan2es4aka1n2d2a and Kr2s2n2a-
<>janmaka1n2d2a. This deals with Prapan5casr2s2t2i (creation
<>of the universe). It says that Prapan5ca is nothing
<>but the Vaivartta (transformation) of Brahman. It is
<>considered to be holy to give this book containing eighteen
<>thousand verses as a gift on the full-moon day in the
<>month of Ma1gha (February).
<NI>(iv) {%Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a.%} This is one of the ancient

<HI>PURU1RAVAS. I. A prominent king of Candravam3s4a
<>(lunar race).
<NI>1) {%Origin of Candravam3s4a and birth of Puru1ravas.%} Descend-
<>ing in order from Brahma1 came Atri--Candra--Budha
<>Puru1ravas. The dynasty which came from Candra was
<>called the Candravam3s4a. Though Budha was the first
<>king of Candravam3s4a it was Puru1ravas who became
<>celebrated. The story of the birth of Puru1ravas is given
<>below:
<NI>Brahma1 in the beginning deputed the sage Atri for the
<>work of creation. Atrimahars2i started the penance
<>called anuttara to acquire sufficient power for creation.
<>After some years Saccida1nanda brahma with an aura of
<>lustre reflected in the heart of that pure and serene
<>soul. In sheer ecstasy tears rolled down his cheeks and
<>the glittering flow of water was lustfully drunk by the
<>zones taking the form of women with a view to produc-
<>ing progenies. They became pregnant but were un-
<>able to bear the embryo of Atri and so they threw them
<>away. Brahma1 took them all and made them into one
<>armoured youth and took him in his chariot to his land.
<>Then the brahmars2is requested Brahma1 to make him
<>their lord. When the rs2is, devas, gandharvas and
<>nymphs praised him reciting sa1maveda the majestic
<>lustre of the youth increased. It was from this that
<>aus2adhas (medicines) originated and that is why
<>Candra is considered to be the lord of medicines, dvija
<>and Vedasvaru1pa. The Candraman2d2ala is full of
<>chemicals. It increases and decreases according to the
<>white half and black half of the moon-based month.
<NI>Daks2a gave in marriage to Candra twentyseven beauti-
<>ful maidens. Then Candra did penance meditating
<>on Vis2n2u for ten thousand Kalpas. Vis2n2u pleased by
<>his penance asked him to name a boon and Candra said
<>“When I perform a ya1ga in svarga all the devas like
<>Brahma1 should come in person to my ya1gas4a1la1 and
<>take the ya1gabha1ga. S4u1lapa1n2i should remain as a
<>watchman at my Ra1jasu1ya.” Accordingly with the
<>blessing of Vis2n2u, Candra conducted the ya1ga in which
<>Atri, Bhr2gu, Brahma1, Vis2n2u, Devas, Vasus, Maruts
<>and Vis4vadevas took part. Candra gave as ya1ga-fees
<>to R2tviks all the three worlds. The ya1ga was complete
<>and when Candra rose up after a bath nine devi1s fell in
<>love with the amorous beauty of Candra. Laks2mi1, wife
<>of Vis2n2u, Sini1va1li1, wife of Kardama, Dyuti, wife of
<>Vibha1vasu, Pus2t2i, wife of Dha1ta1, Prabha1, wife of
<>Su1rya, Kuhu1, wife of Havis2ma1n, Ki1rti, wife of Jayanta,
<>Am3s4uma1li1 wife of Kas4yapa and Dhr2ti wife of Nanda,
<>abandoned their husbands and went with Candra.
<>Candra treated them all as his own wives and gave
<>them erotic pleasure to their hearts' content. Those
<>who saw this non-virtuous act stood dumbfounded un-
<>able to curse Candra.
<NI>Attracted by the dazzling brilliance of Candra Ta1ra1,
<>wife of Br2haspati, went with him. Enraged at this, Br2has-
<>pati joining with other devas prepared for a fight
<>against Candra. Devas took sides and by the media-
<>tion of Indra a conference of both the parties was
<>held and Ta1ra1 was sent back to Br2haspati. Ta1ra1 was
<>pregnant then and Ta1ra1 confessed that the child in her
<>womb was that of Candra. So when that child was [Page620-b+ 63]
<>born Candra took it away and named it Budha. Brahma1
<>and other r2s2is gave Budha a seat among the planets.
<NI>Budha married Ila1 and they got a son named Puru1ravas.
<>(See under Ila1). After that Budha performed a hundred
<>As4vamedhaya1gas. He then enjoyed world prosperity
<>as lord of Saptadvi1pa living in the beautiful Hima1dri-
<>s4r2n3ga. worshipping Brahma1. (Chapter 12, Bha1ga 3,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%Testing Puru1ravas and the curse.%} Puru1ravas by his bril-
<>liance performed a hundred As4vamedhaya1gas and lived
<>in glory at Hima1dris4r2n3ga. Great demons like Kes4i1
<>became his servants. Urvas4i1 attracted by his beauty
<>became his wife. While he was living like that Dharma,
<>Artha and Ka1ma went in disguise to his palace to test
<>him. Hereceived them all well but paid more attention to
<>Dharma. Artha and Ka1ma got angry and cursed him.
<>Artha cursed him saying that he would be ruined by
<>his greed and Ka1ma cursed him saying he would go
<>mad by being separated from Urvas4i1. Hearing that
<>Dharma blessed him thus: “You will live long lead-
<>ing a virtuous life. Your race will increase and
<>remain in glory till the end of the moon and the stars.
<>The insanity caused by your passion for Urvas4i1 would
<>end by the end of sixty years. That celestial maiden
<>would remain then with you for one Manvantara.”
<>(Chapter 12, Bha1ga 3, Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>Puru1ravas used to visit Indra daily. One day while he
<>was going through air wellarmed with a bow and
<>arrows he saw a demon named Kes4i1 carrying away
<>by force Urvas4i1 and Citralekha1 and after defeating
<>Kes4i1 in a fight recovered the nymphs and gave them
<>back to Indra. Indra praised Puru1ravas and in his
<>honour a drama, Laks2mi1svayam3vara, was enacted by
<>Urvas4i1, Menaka1 and others. Urvas4i1 taking the part of
<>Laks2mi1 started to dance but seeing Puru1ravas before
<>her she became lustful and made wrong steps. Na1rada
<>who was present at the function got angry and cursed her
<>“You will forget all you have learnt. Not only that,
<>you will live as a creeper separated from Puru1ravas for
<>a period of sixty years.” (For details see under Urvas4i1).
<>Padma Pura1n2a says that it was Bharata who cursed
<>Urvas4i1. This story is slightly different from that found
<>in the other Pura1n2as.
<NI>3) {%Sons of Puru1ravas.%} Urvas4i1 got eight sons of Puru1ravas
<>named A1yus, Dr2d2ha1yus, Vas4ya1yus, Dana1yus, Vr2ttima1n,
<>Vasu, Divija1ta and Suba1hu. Of these A1yus became the
<>propagator of the dynasty. Of the sons born to A1yus
<>five sons, Nahus2a, Vr2ddhas4arma1, Raji, Dambha and
<>Vipa1pma1 became celebrities. A hundred sons were
<>born to Raji. They were called Ra1jeyas. (Chapter 12,
<>Bha1ga 3, Padma Pura1n2a).

<NI>(i) Once Puru1ravas stole the wealth of some brahmins.
<>The brahmins took Sanatkuma1ra along with them and
<>made representations to the king. Puru1ravas did not
<>give back their wealth. The brahmins cursed him and as
<>a result the prosperity of the King waned. Then Puru1-
<>ravas brought down from svarga three Agnis and per-
<>formed a ya1ga and thus regained his lost splendour
<>and prosperity. (Chapter 75, A1di Parva). [Page621-a+ 65]

<NI>1) {%General information.%} This is a holy place situated
<>36 Kilometres to the north of Ajmer. Brahma1 once did
<>penance there. There is a temple of Brahma1 there.
<>Padma Pura1n2a gives a story about the origin of this
<>ti1rtha:--
<NI>Once Brahma1 came to a place holding a lotus. Then
<>Brahma1 saw Vajrana1bha who was engaged in penance
<>for the destruction of the devas. Suddenly the lotus in
<>the hands of Brahma1 fell down making a thundering
<>noise. The sound was so loud that its vibrations killed
<>Vajrana1bha. From that day onwards the place was
<>known as Pus2kara.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Arjuna spent the period after his pilgrimage in this
<>ti1rtha. (S4loka 14, Chapter 220, A1di Parva).
<NI>(ii) Once sage Pulastya praised the greatness of
<>Pus2kara. (S4loka 20, Chapter 82, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iii) Sage Dhaumya praised the greatness of Pus2kara-
<>ti1rtha. (S4loka 16, Chapter 89, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iv) Once the god of death came and did penance at
<>this place. (S4loka 26, Chapter 54, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(v) Once Brahma1 performed a Ya1ga at this place and
<>then Sarasvati1 rose up from the place in the name of
<>Suprabha1. (S4loka 5, Chapter 38, S4alya Parva).
<NI>(vi) If one performs penance at this place peacefully
<>one can attain moks2a. (Chapter 297, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PUS2KARA V. A mountain in the island of Pus2kara.
<>This mountain is full of precious stones. (S4loka 24,
<>Chapter 12, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>PUS2KARA VI. One of the seven islands. The other six
<>are Jambu1dvi1pa, Plaks2advi1pa, S4a1lmali1dvi1pa, Kus4a-
<>dvi1pa, Kraun5cadvi1pa, and S4a1kadvi1pa. (8th Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>PUS2KARADHA1RIN2I1. The wife of a sage. There was
<>once a sage named Satya in the country of Vidarbha.
<>Pus2karadha1rin2i1 was the wife of Satya. Satya who be-
<>lieved in Ahim3sa1 performed a Ya1ga with fruits and
<>roots. It is believed that no ya1ga is perfect if performed
<>without a sacrificial goat. But even his wife for fear of
<>a curse did not object to a Ya1ga of the kind.
<NI>There was another sage living in that forest in the form
<>of a deer due to a curse and he was a great friend of
<>Satya. The deer came to the place of the Yajn5a and
<>requested Satya to kill him as the sacrificial animal to
<>make the Ya1ga a success. Satya did not agree to that
<>but then Sa1vitri1devi1 appeared in person and compelled
<>him to kill the deer and conduct the Ya1ga. With great
<>reluctance Satya killed the deer and conducted the
<>Ya1ga; but the power of penance of Satya faded away
<>by that deed of his. Then Pus2karadha1rin2i1 performed
<>penance to regain the power of her husband and
<>Dharma appeared in person and blessed Satya.
<>(Chapter 272, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PUS2KARA1KS2A I. A King of Pura1n2ic fame.
<NI>There was once a King called Bhadra1ks2a in Taks2a-
<>s4ila1nagara. He worshipped Bhagavati1 with 108 lotus
<>flowers daily in order to obtain a son. One day he
<>found one flower missing and the brave king tore open
<>his heart and made the number complete. The goddess
<>was pleased and she blessed him saying that he would [Page622-b+ 65]
<>have a son worthy of becoming an emperor. Pus2kara1ks2a
<>was the son thus born.
<NI>The boy grew up and after crowing him as King
<>Bhadra1ks2a left for the forests. Pus2kara1ks2a worshipped
<>S4iva daily to get a suitable wife. After some time S4iva
<>blessed him saying that he would get a very good wife.
<NI>One day he went for hunting. He saw a camel trying
<>to eat two cobras engaged in the act of mating. Instant-
<>ly the King sent an arrow against the camel and the
<>camel falling down turned into a Vidya1dhara and that
<>Vidya1dhara told the King thus:-- “Oh King, there was
<>once a Vidya1dhara named Ran3gama1li1. A Vidya1dhara
<>maiden named Ta1ra1vali1 was attracted by the hand-
<>some form of Ran3gama1li1. She married him without the
<>consent of her parents. The angered father separated
<>them by a curse. The curse took effect and they soon
<>got separated losing their way in the forest. Pining to
<>see her husband Ta1ra1vali1 roamed about in the forests
<>and reached the other shore of the western sea. It was
<>a colony of r2s2is and there was a fig tree there standing
<>in full blossom. Ta1ra1vali1 took the form of a beetle and
<>sat on the tree sucking honey. After some days Ran3ga-
<>ma1li1 also came to the place. On seeing her husband
<>she had emission and from the virile fluid was born a
<>fig fruit. After that both of them flew to the Gan-
<>dharva loka. I am Ran3gama1li1. One day a sage
<>named Jita1su came that way and this fruit fell before
<>him. From the fruit came out a beautiful maiden and
<>Jita1su with his divine power understood the whole
<>story behind it and so took the girl to his a1s4rama and
<>named her Vinayavati1. Vinayavati1 grew into a beauti-
<>ful maiden and stayed in the a1s4rama. One day by
<>accident I happened to see her and attracted by her
<>beauty tried to rape her. She cried aloud and hearing
<>the noise the sage came out and cursed me and turned
<>me into a camel. I pleaded for mercy and the sage
<>said I would be released from the curse when I was
<>killed by the future husband of Vinayavati1, Pus2kara1ks2a
<>by name. Oh King, I am now released from the curse
<>and you should go to the forest named Surabhima1ruta
<>on the other side of the western sea and marry that
<>maiden.”
<NI>Pus2kara1ks2a was pleased to hear this and the king going
<>back to the palace and entrusting the administration of
<>the state to his ministers left for the forest of Surabhi-
<>ma1ruta. Reaching the shore of the western sea he was
<>thinking of ways to cross the sea when he saw a
<>Bhadraka1li1 temple nearby. When he went to the
<>temple he saw a violin in front of it and taking it he
<>played on it a few songs in praise of Ka1li1 and went to
<>sleep in the temple. The goddess was pleased with his
<>songs and took the sleeping king to the other side of the
<>sea. When he woke up next morning he saw himself
<>on the other shore and was pleasantly surprised. He
<>walked about on the shore and saw an a1s4rama and
<>peeping in saw a sage sitting inside. On seeing the
<>king the sage told him thus “Oh Pus2karara1ja, Vinaya-
<>vati1 in search of whom you have come here has just
<>gone to pluck flowers for her worship. She will come
<>just now and you can then accept your wife of your
<>previous birth as your wife of this life.”
<NI>The king wanted to know more about Vinayavati1
<>when the sage said she was his wife in his previous
<>birth also. Then the sage said: “Once there was a
<>Vais4ya called Dharmasena in Ta1mralipti. He married [Page623-a+ 64]
<>a girl named Vidyullekha1. All their wealth was stolen
<>by thieves and grief-stricken they attempted to commit
<>suicide by jumping into the fire. They saw two swans
<>flying towards them and without waiting for them to
<>reach them they committed suicide. In their next birth
<>they became a swan couple. They lived on a date tree
<>during rainy seasons. Once in a storm the tree
<>fell down and in the darkness each went its own way.
<>In the morning the male swan started searching for his
<>mate. In the end he found her in the lake of Ma1nasa
<>in Svarga. They lived there happily till the rainy
<>season was over and then they went and stayed on a
<>mountain. One day a forester killed the she-swan and
<>while coming with the dead swan in his hands he saw
<>a set of armed men coming that way and the frightened
<>forester threw the dead swan into a lake nearby.
<>The dead swan came in touch with the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1
<>herb in the pond and coming to life flew away.
<NI>The husband swan went into another group of swans
<>and lived there in sorrow. One day a fisherman came
<>and caught all the swans in a net. At that time the she-
<>swan came there and finding her husband in the net
<>felt very sad. She was thinking of some way to get her
<>husband released from the net when a man came to
<>bathe in the pond. He wrapped the diamond necklace
<>of his in a cloth and placed it on the shore. The she-
<>swan took the necklace and flew making the fisherman
<>see everything before him. Seeing the swan going
<>with the necklace the fisherman went after it. The swan
<>flew to a mountain nearby and placed it on its top.
<>The fisherman started climbing up and the she-swan
<>then flew back and released her husband from the net.
<>One day while they were flying making a lotus as an
<>umbrella a hunter shot them down with arrows. Fortu-
<>nately the lotus fell on an idol of S4iva and by the power
<>of S4iva they were born in their next birth as a king
<>and a woman. The king is yourself and the woman is
<>Vinayavati1.”
<NI>Pus2kara1ks2a married her there and returning to his
<>land lived happily for a long period (Taran3ga1 2,
<>S4as4a1n3kavati1lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).

<HI>PUS2KARAMA1LINI1. A very virtuous woman. She was
<>the wife of a sage named Satya who lived on alms in
<>the country of Vidarbha. Because she was very strict and
<>perfect in the observance of vratas she became lean

<>she made her own dress out of peacock feathers gather-
<>ed from forests. Pus2karama1lini1 was against sacrificing
<>cows in yajn5as. (Chapter 246, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PUS2KARIN2I1 I. Wife of Ca1ks2us2a Manu. Ca1ks2us2a got

<>got themselves released from the curse. (Chapter 43,
<>Uttara Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>PUS2PAKA I. A divine Aerial Chariot.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Vis4vakarma1 had a daughter named Sam3jn5a1.
<>She was married to Su1rya. But Sam3jn5a1 could not live
<>with Su1rya for long because of the terrible heat and so
<>she came back and told her father about it. At once
<>Vis4vakarma1 ordered Su1rya to come to him and the
<>former then tried to reduce his brightness by rubbing
<>him on a grindstone. However much he tried he was
<>not able to reduce even an eighth of his brightness.
<>The brightness of the Sun which was rubbed out spread
<>in the atmosphere as suspended lustrous particles.
<>Vis4vakarma1 collected that lustrous dust and from it
<>created four brilliant things. The Cakra1yudha of
<>Maha1vis2n2u is one, the Tris4u1la of S4iva is another, and
<>the third is Pus2pakavima1na (Pus2paka Aerial chariot).
<>The fourth is S4akti, a weapon of Subrahman2ya. Vis4va-

<NI>2) {%How Kubera got the Pus2paka.%} Vais4ravan2a alias
<>Kubera was the son born to Vis4ravas of his wife
<>Devavarn2ini1, daughter of sage Bharadva1ja. Vis4ravas
<>did penance to please Brahma1 to get a son and Vais4-
<>ravan2a was born by the blessing of Brahma1. Kubera
<>also, even while he was a boy, went to the valley of
<>Himava1n and did penance there. Kubera did penance
<>for ten thousand years with his head downwards in
<>cold water and another ten thousand years in Pan5ca1gni
<>standing on one leg. At that time Brahma1 appeared
<>in person and asked what boon he wanted. He said he
<>wanted to be one of the lokapa1lakas (guardians of the
<>universe). Granting Kubera that, Brahma1 gave him
<>two treasures named S4an3khanidhi and Padmanidhi
<>and also the Pus2pakavima1na. After that Kubera built
<>a city named Lan3ka1 on the mountain of Triku1t2a in the
<>southern ocean and started living there.
<NI>3) {%How Ra1van2a got the Pus2paka.%} Vis4ravas had three
<>more sons named Ra1van2a, Kumbhakarn2a and Vibhi1-
<>san2a. They did penance and acquired divine powers.
<>Ra1van2a then went to Lan3ka1 and after defeating Kubera
<>and sending him north captured Lan3ka1 and made it
<>his capital. He also took by force the Pus2paka from
<>Kubera.
<NI>All the victory marches of Ra1van2a were in this Pus2paka.
<>Once Ra1van2a was going in his Pus2paka with a Yaks2a [Page624-a+ 65]
<>beauty kidnapped from Alaka1puri1 when the girl cried
<>loudly attracting the attention of Sampa1ti, a vulture
<>King. Sampa1ti attacked Ra1van2a with his fierce beak
<>and powerful claws. Ra1van2a's weapons proved futile
<>against Sampa1ti and the bird broke the Pus2paka into
<>pieces. But the Vima1na was a divine one and it
<>regained the original shape and utility soon. All the
<>weapons of Ra1van2a were destroyed, the great weapon
<>Candraha1sa was thrown away. The crown of Ra1van2a
<>was struck down and trampled upon. With his sharp
<>beak and piercing claws Sampa1ti made bruises on the
<>face of Ra1van2a. Unable to bear the attack of the
<>mighty bird Ra1van2a begged for peace. Sampa1ti asked
<>Ra1van2a to release the Yaks2a girl which Ra1van2a did at
<>once. Ra1van2a then returned to Lan3ka1 in the Pus2paka
<>(Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a). It was in
<>this Pus2paka plane that Ra1van2a kidnapped Si1ta1. In
<>the battle that followed, Ra1van2a was killed and the
<>Pus2paka Vima1na came into the possession of Vibhi1s2an2a
<>who gave it as a gift to S4ri1 Ra1ma. S4ri1 Ra1ma sent it
<>back to its original owner, Kubera. But S4ri1 Ra1ma used
<>it again for once.
<NI>A s4u1dra named S4ambu1ka started performing penance
<>in Ra1mara1jya as a consequence of which there started a
<>series of infant deaths in the country. S4ri1 Ra1ma knew
<>the cause and he got down by meditation the Pus2paka
<>Vima1na from Kubera. When the plane came from
<>Kubera S4ri1 Ra1ma got into it and flew to the place
<>where S4ambu1ka was doing penance and on reaching
<>there killed the S4u1dra and saved the country from a
<>calamity. The Vima1na was then sent back to Kubera.

<>yojanas high. All things inside it, the ground, the trees,
<>the birds, the animals, plants, creepers and gardens are
<>pus2para1ga-studded and look red like saffron. Therefore
<>the fort is called Ratnas4a1la1 also. All the dikpa1lakas of

<>consort. (Devi1 Bha1gavata 9, 1; Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a,
<>2, 49 and 56-57 and A1di Parva Chapter 11).

<>found Viraja1 in the company of Kr2s2n2a and Suda1ma1
<>she, in great anger, insulted Kr2s2n2a whereupon Suda1ma1
<>cursed her to be born in human womb and experience the
<>pangs of separation from Kr2s2n2a. (Na1rada Pura1n2a 2. 8;
<>Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a. 2. 49) and Ra1dha1 cursed him
<>in turn to be born in the da1nava dynasty. It was on
<>account of this curse of Ra1dha1 that Suda1ma1 was born
<>as the asura called S4an3khacu1d2a. (Brahma Vaivarta
<>Pura1n2a, 2. 4. 9. 34).

<>sharp knife was thrown off at a distance in the forest and
<>it fell on the neck of Rahodara, who happened to be
<>walking at the time in the forest. It (the head) cut
<>deep into the bones of the Sage and that made it
<>difficult for him to move about. Yet, he visited all the
<>holy places on the earth with the skull of the Ra1ks2asa
<>around his neck. At last he told the noble R2s2is about
<>his misfortune and they directed him to visit ‘Aus4anasa-
<>ti1rtha,’ and the moment he touched the water in the

<>immediately started to Gaya1 to do penance. There
<>he met with the Sanatkuma1ras. (Vara1ha Pura1n2a).
<NI>Urvas4i1 made an earnest effort to hinder the severe vow
<>and penance of Raibhya. But it was of no use, and by

<>his Commander-in-chief. The Commander-in-chief
<>should be of noble birth and well-versed in law. Only
<>a strong man who can speak boldly and openly should
<>be appointed emissary or ambassador. Either a male
<>or a female may be appointed to carry chewing mate-
<>rials. But, that person should be loyal, friendly and
<>capable of putting up with hardships. The body-guard
<>of the King should be a good swords-man. Ministers
<>should be conversant with dharmas4a1stras (moral and

<>forts, the architect, preceptor in archery and the chief
<>of the internal administration of the palace.
<NI>When it is yet three hours for the dawn, the King
<>should wake up from sleep. Music, praises by courtiers
<>etc. should herald his waking up. As soon as he has
<>woken up, the King should hold talks with his spies.
<>Then he should examine accounts and only after this
<>should he begin the ablutions. After his pu1ja1 (worship)
<>is over, cows with gold should be gifted to brahmins.
<>With their blessings he must look first into the mirror
<>and then in ghee along with gold. Then he must look
<>up the almanac for the day's star etc. And after having
<>taken the medicine prescribed by the physician and [Page627-b+ 65]
<>also the blessings of the preceptor the King should
<>attend court. (Agni Pura1n2a. Chapter 235).
<NI>According to Chapter 8 of the Manusmr2ti (a great

<>shoulders of Indra, Va1yu, Yama, Su1rya, Agni, Varun2a,
<>Candra and Kubera.

<>Another King, Ambuvi1ca, had for a time ruled over the
<>city. (A1di Parva, Chapter 203, Verse 17). Afterwards
<>Jara1sandha became its King. Girivraja is a holy place
<>as well. He who bathes here will become as pleasant-
<>looking as King Kaks2i1va1n. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84,
<>Verse 104).
<HI>RA1JAMUKHI1. A celestial woman. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>RA1JANI1. A holy river in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,

<HI>RA1JANI1TI. (Politics and administration).
<NI>Politics and administration or administrative politics in
<>ancient India is dealt with in Manusmr2ti and Agni
<>Pura1n2a. A very brief summary of it is given below:
<NI>The King should organise six kinds of army formations,
<>worship the Devas duly and then set out for war.
<>Mu1labala, Bhu1tabala, S4ren2i1bala, Suhr2dbala, S4atrubala
<>and A1t2avikabala are the six kinds of army formations.
<>The list is given in order of the comparative importance
<>of the bala. The army has six parts i.e. Mantra (advi-
<>sers), Kos2a (treasury), Pada1ti (infantry), Turaga
<>(Cavalry), Gaja (elephant) and Ratha (chariot).
<NI>If an attack is feared either against the forts or across
<>rivers or trenches, the army should be marched for their
<>protection. The Army Chieftains surrounded by mighty
<>warriors should lead the divisions. The King and his
<>wife should be at the centre of the army-division along
<>with the treasury and first class soldiers. On both sides
<>of the King should march the cavalry and the chariots
<>should form the farther wings. Elephants should proceed
<>on the two sides of the chariot and soldiers recruited
<>from forests must march on the sides of the elephants.
<>The supreme commander will march behind all the
<>others guiding the army.
<NI>If there is cause for fear in front of the army during
<>the march, three Vyu1has (Phalanxes) Makara, S4yena
<>or Su1ci1 should be put in the Vanguard. The S4akat2a
<>Vyu1ha is more suited to meet an attack from behind. If
<>attack is feared from the flanks then also the S4akat2a-
<>vyu1ha is advisable. When attack from all the sides is
<>feared sarvatobhadravyu1ha is indicated. It is the duty
<>of the Supreme Commander to safe-guard his army
<>and suppress reactionary forces whenever the army gets
<>weakened, when it marches through caves, mountains or [Page628-a+ 64]
<>rocks or other difficult terrain or weakened by the
<>persistent attacks of the enemy.
<NI>When the time, place and the people's attitude are
<>favourable, the King should engage himself in open war
<>with the enemy, and if they are unfavourable he shall
<>not go in for war. If confrontation with the enemy
<>occurs under circumstances in which the King is visible
<>to the enemy, powerful divisions of the army consisting
<>of warriors of great calibre should be stationed either at
<>the front or in the rear.
<NI>In the formation of vyu1has (phalanx) there are seven
<>factors called Uras (breast), Kaks2as (arm-pits), two
<>Paks2as (sides), two Madhyas (centre) and Pr2s2t2ha
<>(rear). The commanders should be surrounded by
<>bold soldiers. The leader is the very life of the war.
<>At the Uras of the vyu1ha powerful elephants, at the
<>Kaks2as chariots and at the Paks2as cavalry should be
<>stationed. This is called paks2abhedivyu1ha. If at the
<>centre cavalry and at Kaks2as and Paks2as elephants are
<>stationed, it is called antarbhedivyu1ha. If there are no
<>chariots, cavalry or infantry may be put in their place.
<>Certain authorities maintain that in every vyu1ha
<>elephants may be stationed in the place of chariots, if
<>chariots are not available. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 242).
<HI>RA1JAPURA I. An ancient and famous city in Ka1mboja.

<>Karpu1raman5jari1 refers to him as the preceptor of a
<>king of Kanauj. Ra1jas4ekhara was known by the name
<>Kavira1ja also.
<NI>Ba1lara1ma1yan2a, called also Maha1na1t2aka, is a drama in

<NI>The king consoled and made them return. Then he

<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 22, Verse 22).
<NI>Uttarara1ma1yan2a, contains the following story about the
<>origin of Ra1ks2asas. When Brahma1 was reciting the
<>Vedas at the beginning of Kr2tayuga he felt very hungry
<>and certain forms emanated from his face. Those who
<>were born from his anger assumed the form of Ra1-
<>ks2asas and those from his hunger that of Yaks2as. The
<>Ra1ks2asas turned out to be evil folk killing and eating
<>cows and brahmins. Praheti and Heti were the
<>first born Ra1ks2asas, the latter of whom wedded Bhaya1,
<>daughter of Ka1la, and to them was born a son called
<>Vidyutkes4a. He married Sa1lakat2an3ka1, daughter of
<>Sandhya1. Though a child was born to them they
<>forsook it in the Hima1layan slopes and went their own
<>way.
<NI>At that time S4iva and Pa1rvati1 came that way and after
<>blessing the child returned to Kaila1sa. The child was
<>named S4ukes4a. He married Devavati1, daughter of the
<>Gandharva called Man2imaya and three children were
<>born to the couple, viz. Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1 and Ma1li1.
<>They did tapas to propitiate Brahma1 and when he
<>appeared requested him thus: “We must defeat Yaks2as
<>Kinnaras, Gandharvas, Siddhas, Vidya1dharas, Yama,
<>Kubera, Va1sava, Na1ga kings and daityas and da1navas
<>and we must not be defeated by any one. We must
<>kill all enemies and they shall not kill us. We three
<>shall never quarrel among ourselves.”
<NI>Brahma1 granted all their prayers. The three, proud and
<>haughty due to these boons, began roaming about con-
<>suming cows and brahmins. They asked Vis4vakarma1
<>to build a city for them and he built for them Lan3ka1
<>on Mount Triku1t2a in the south sea. The three brothers
<>took their abode in Lan3ka1 Ma1lyava1n, Suma1li1 and
<>Ma1li1 married respectively Sundari1. Ketumati1, and
<>Vasudha1, daughters of the Gandharva woman Narmada1
<>Ma1lyava1n begot of Sundari1 seven sons called Vajramus2t2i
<>Viru1pa1ks2a, Durm2ukha, Suptaghna, Yajn5akos4a, Matta,
<>and Unmatta, and also a daughter called Nala1.
<NI>To Suma1li1 were born of Ketumati1 ten sons and also four
<>daughters.
<NI>Four sons were born to Ma1li1 of his wife Vasudha1, and
<>they became the ministers of Vibhi1s2an2a.
<NI>Then thousands of Raks2asas were born as sons, grand-
<>sons, brothers, nephews, etc. to the above and they lived
<>in Lan3ka1, a terror to the whole world.
<NI>While the daughters of Suma1li1, Veka1, Pus2potkat2a1,
<>Kaikasi1 and Kumbhi1nasi1 were once walking in the
<>forest they saw Kubera on a visit to Brahma1 in all
<>pomp and glory. They understood that Kubera owed
<>his pomp and glory to his being the son of Vis4ravas and
<>therefore, the next day one of the four, Kaikas4i1, went
<>to Vis4ravas's a1s4rama and prayed for children by him.
<>Three sons called Ra1van2a, Vibhi1s2an2a and Kumbha-
<>karn2a and a daughter called S4u1rpan2akha1 were born to

<>Muni once conducted a yajn5a to annihilate the Ra1ks2asas
<>altogether. (A1di Parva, Chapter 180). The provocation
<>for Para1s4ara to conduct the yajn5a was that a Ra1ks2asa
<>called Kalma1s2apa1da ate S4akti, the father of the muni
<>and the son of Vasis2t2ha. When the yajn5a had reached
<>its climax Pulastya, Pulaha and Kratu went to Para1s4ara
<>and held conciliatory talks with him, and Para1s4ara,
<>ended the yajn5a. The Agni that he had made to devour
<>the Ra1ks2asas was discarded on the slopes of the Hima1-

<HI>RAKTABI1JA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Rebirth of Rambha1sura, father of Mahi-
<>s2a1sura. Stories of Raktabi1ja and Rambha1sura are
<>inextricably intertwined.
<NI>2) {%Origin of Raktabi1ja.%} Once upon a time there lived an
<>asura king called Danu. His two sons, Rambha and
<>Karambha who had no children, did tapas at Pan5canada
<>for the blessing of having issues. Rambha and Karambha
<>meditated upon Ma1lavat2a Yaks2a, the former seated at
<>the centre of the five fires and the latter standing in the
<>water. Indra in the guise of a crocodile dragged
<>Karambha away by the feet and killed him. Angry at
<>the death of his brother, Rambha decided to cut off his
<>head and offer it in fire. When he was about to do so,
<>Agni appeared and told him that suicide was worse
<>than killing others, and promised to grant him what-
<>ever he desired. Accordingly Rambha requested Agni
<>for a son more effulgent than the latter, who would
<>conquer the three worlds and would not be defeated
<>even by the Devas and the Asuras. Rambha further
<>wanted that son to be as powerful as Va1yu, exceptionally
<>handsome and skilled in archery.
<NI>Agni blessed Rambha that he would have, as desired, a
<>son by the woman whom he coveted. On his way
<>back home he saw a beautiful she-buffalo, which he
<>married. He took the buffalo which got pregnant by
<>him, to Pa1ta1la to protect it from the attack by
<>other buffaloes. One day another buffalo felt a passion
<>for Rambha's wife and in the fight that ensued Rambha
<>was killed by it. Rambha's wife died in his funeral
<>pyre. It was from the centre of the fire that the very
<>powerful Mahis2a1sura was born. Rambha1sura also rose
<>from the fire under the name Raktabi1ja. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 17; Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Boon to Raktabi1ja.%} Raktabi1ja secured from S4iva a
<>boon according to which if one drop of blood from
<>his body fell on the battlefield, many Raktabi1jas would
<>arise from the blood and fight the enemies. Each of
<>these Raktabi1jas would also be like the others in the
<>matter of strength, form and weapons. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, 5th Skandha). [Page630-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%His death.%} War between Devas and Asuras broke out
<>and in the fight between Devi1 and Raktabi1ja blood from
<>his body flowed. When Devi1 found it impossible to
<>kill the lakhs of Rakta1suras who arose from the blood,
<>she resorted to a trick. She asked Ca1mun2d2i1 to lick off
<>the blood flowing from Raktabi1ja before it fell on the
<>ground. Accordingly Devi1 began killing the asuras and
<>Ca1mun2d2i1 consuming their blood and flesh. When the
<>artificial Raktabi1jas were all killed thus, the original
<>Raktabi1ja alone remained and in the fight between
<>them, Devi1 cut off his head with her sword. Ca1mun2d2i1
<>did not permit even a drop of blood to fall on the
<>ground. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha).
<HI>RAKTAJA. A form assumed by Arjuna in his previous
<>birth. The following story is told in Padma Pura1n2a
<>(Chapter 14) about Arjuna being reborn as such at the
<>meeting of Kali and Dva1para yugas and Svedaja being
<>born as Karn2a during the same period.
<NI>Once during a quarrel between S4iva and Brahma1 the
<>former nipped off Brahma1's head. (For details see under
<>Brahma1). Some drops of sweat appeared on the fore-
<>head of the angry Brahma1, and from the sweat which
<>Brahma1 wiped with his hand arose a person wearing a
<>thousand shields, bow and quiver. That person was
<>Svedaja. He asked Brahma1 what he should do and
<>the former granted him permission to destroy S4iva. He
<>then approached S4iva with bow drawn and the frighten-
<>ed S4iva ran to Vis2n2u and sought refuge. Svedaja
<>followed S4iva and when Vis2n2u, seeing him, raised a
<>loud noise ‘Hum’. S4iva prostrated at Vis2n2u's feet. S4iva
<>extended the skull in his hand towards Vis2n2u request-
<>ing something to be given to him. Maha1vis2n2u, who had
<>nothing else to give S4iva, put his right hand into the
<>skull as alms, S4iva wounded the hand with his S4u1la
<>(three-pronged weapon) and pure red blood began
<>flowing from the hand into the skull. The blood con-
<>tinued flowing for a thousand years in a length of fifty
<>yojanas and thickness of ten yojanas. At the end of
<>the period Vis2n2u asked whether the skull was not filled
<>yet, and looking into the skull with his three eyes S4iva
<>answered that it was full. Then Vis2n2u stopped the
<>flow of blood, and S4iva, in the presence of Vis2n2u, looked
<>into the blood for a thousand years and stirred it with his
<>hand. The blood gradually turned into a bubble, and
<>a person possessing thousand hands and as glowing as
<>fire appeared in the skull. He had a crown on his head
<>and he held in his hands a bow and quiver. He wore
<>gloves on his hands. And, that was Raktaja, an in-
<>carnation of Narars2i.
<NI>Looking at Raktaja, S4iva told Vis2n2u thus: “This master
<>in archery is Nara. You spoke Nara, and let his name,
<>therefore be Nara. Oh Na1ra1yan2a, you both will be
<>called Narana1ra1yan2as. This Nara will be of help to
<>you on behalf of the Devas and also in the sustenance
<>and protection of the world. He will further help you
<>to kill the asuras. Nara, the great intellectual that he
<>is, will become a muni, of surpassing wisdom. Brahma1's
<>divine fifth head possesses so much of effulgence. Nara
<>is created from that effulgence and also from the blood
<>from your hands and my look at it. He will annihilate
<>all enemies in war. He will be a terror to those persons
<>who cannot be conquered by you, Indra and the other
<>Devas.
<NI>While Vis2n2u stood there amazed Raktaja praised him
<>and S4iva with folded hands and asked from the skull [Page630-b+ 65]
<>what he should do. Then S4iva ordered him thus:
<>You kill this asura (Svedaja) created by Brahma1 with
<>his own effulgence.” And S4iva led Raktaja out of the
<>skull by his hands and told him again:--“Look, here
<>lies the terrible person I spoke about made unconscious
<>by the cry of ‘Hum’ by Vis2n2u. Awake him immedia-
<>tely.” After having said this S4iva disappeared. Nara,
<>in the presence of Na1ra1yan2a, kicked the unconscious
<>Svedaja with his left foot, and he came out of his un-
<>conscious state.
<NI>The fierce fight that ensued between Raktaja and
<>Svedaja continued for two years. By then Svedaja had
<>lost everything but one of his shields and Raktaja had
<>only his two arms to fight with. At this stage Va1sudeva
<>(Vis2n2u) in great alarm went and asked Brahma1
<>whether Raktaja might not kill Svedaja. Brahma1
<>answered, ‘In the next birth Nara may defeat Svedaja’.
<>Saying ‘Right, let that be so’, Vis2n2u returned to the
<>battlefield and withdrew them from fighting with the
<>assurance that they would be given an opportunity to
<>fight again during the period of the Kali and the
<>Dva1para yugas.
<NI>Afterwards Vis2n2u directed A1ditya (Sun) and A1khan2-
<>d2ala (Indra) to look after Raktaja and Svedaja. He
<>told A1ditya further:--“At the end of the Dva1para
<>yuga you should see that Svedaja is reborn, in the
<>interests of the Devas, as your son. In the Yadu
<>dynasty will be born a very powerful fellow called
<>S4u1ra and he will have a very beautiful daughter named
<>Pr2tha1. Durva1sas will advise her some mantras as a
<>boon and she will have some sons from the Devas
<>whom she will invoke with the mantras. With that
<>object in view, while in her periods, she would, at the
<>time of dawn gaze at you with love. Then he (Svedaja)
<>will be born as the son called Vasus2en2a of Kunti1, the
<>virgin.”
<NI>The Sun-God agreed to obey the above instructions of
<>Vis2n2u and told him further:--“I shall procreate in the
<>virgin a very powerful and valiant son, who will become
<>well-known in the world as Karn2a. He will gift away
<>all wealth to brahmins.” After saying this Su1rya dis-
<>appeared.
<NI>After this Vis2n2u told Indra as follows:--“You
<>should, at the end of the Dva1para yuga see that this
<>Nara, born from blood, is reborn as an aspect of
<>yours on earth. King Pa1n2d2u will one day go into the
<>forest with his wives, Kunti1 and Ma1dri1, and he will
<>then become the object of an animal's curse. He will
<>therefore, in a spirit of renunciation, go to mount
<>S4atas4r2n3ga where he would ask Kunti1 to become a
<>mother by another man. Unwilling to do so Kunti1
<>will desire to have sons by Devas, and when she prays
<>to you, you should favour her with this Nara as son.
<NI>Devendra raised a legal objection to the above injunc-
<>tion of Vis2n2u as follows:--“You, who incarnated your-
<>self as Ra1ma in the twentyseventh yuga of the last
<>Manvantara for the purpose of killing Ra1van2a, killed
<>my son Ba1li. Therefore I do not wish to procreate
<>Nara as my son.” To this objection of Indra Vis2n2u
<>assured him that as a penalty for the mistake of killing
<>Ba1li, he would be a companion of Nara (Arjuna) who
<>would be born as Indra's son.
<NI>According to the above terms and conditions fighting
<>between Raktaja and Svedaja ended. In the next
<>birth Raktaja was born as Arjuna and Svedaja as [Page631-a+ 65]
<>Karn2a. Maha1vis2n2u incarnated himself as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>The meeting of the three in the battle-field is well-
<>known.
<HI>RAKTA1N3GA. A na1ga born in Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's dynasty. It
<>was burnt to death at the yajn5a of Janamejaya. (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 18).
<HI>RAMA1. A synonym for Maha1laks2mi1. There is a story
<>in the eighth Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata as to how the
<>name Rama1 came to be attached to Laks2mi1.
<NI>Revanta, the very handsome son of Su1rya one day came
<>to Vaikun2t2ha mounted on his horse Uccais4s4ravas
<>to pay his respects to Maha1vis2n2u. Even Laks2mi1devi1
<>stood aghast speechless for a very short time at the
<>charm of Revanta changing her looks between him and
<>his horse. Maha1vis2n2u did not at all like this and cursed
<>that since Laks2mi1's eyes enjoyed the sight of some one
<>she would come to be called Rama1 also and that she
<>would be born as a mare on earth.
<HI>RA1MA (S4RI1 RA1MA). The seventh incarnation of

<NI>2) {%Reason for his birth.%} When Ra1van2a was ruling over
<>Lan3ka1 as a terror to the world, evils and cruelties like
<>matricide, patricide, fratricide, killing of cows, hatred
<>for good people, children's death, abduction of women,
<>killing of munis, thefts etc. became rampant. When the
<>world became grief-stricken Bhu1midevi1 (Goddess of
<>earth) assumed the form of a cow and took refuge with
<>Indra in Svarga. She told him about the atrocities
<>committed by Ra1van2a and the other Ra1ks2asas. Then
<>Indra took Bhu1midevi1 (cow) to Brahma1, who took
<>them to S4iva at Kaila1sa as killing Ra1van2a was beyond
<>his (Brahma1's) power. S4iva thought it improper on
<>his part to kill Ra1van2a and so he took Brahma1 and
<>others to Vis2n2u and submitted their grievance to him.
<>Vis2n2u consoled them by saying as follows:--“I have
<>decided to incarnate myself as the son of Das4aratha, king
<>of Ayodhya1. You Devas also should take birth on earth
<>to help me to kill Ra1van2a and other evil Ra1ks2asas and
<>to protect Bhu1midevi1 and the good people on the
<>earth.” (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rva Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Birth%} King Das4aratha of the solar dynasty ruled
<>Kosala with Ayodhya1 as his capital. Mahars2i Vasis2t2ha
<>was his family preceptor. With the cooperation of
<>eight ministers such as Sumantra and others he ruled
<>the country in the path of supreme welfare and pros-
<>perity. A daughter, S4a1nta1, was born to him of his wife
<>Kausalya1. Years passed by, yet he had no son. One
<>of those days King Lomapa1da, close friend of Das4aratha
<>visited Ayodhya1. Lomapa1da, who was childless
<>requested Dasaratha for S4a1nta1 and she was given
<>as his adopted daughter by Das4aratha. Lomapa1da gave
<>her in marriage to R2s2yas4r2n3ga, who had once caused
<>rain-fall in An3ga. (For details see under R2s2yas4r2n3ga). [Page631-b+ 65]
<NI>To have a son, Das4aratha took as his second wife
<>Kaikeyi1, daughter of the King of Kekaya and younger
<>sister of Yudha1jit. But she turned out to be barren.
<>Then he married Sumitra1, daughter of the King of
<>Ka1s4i1. Even after many years none of the three wives
<>of Das4aratha presented him with a son.
<NI>One of those days Da aratha went deep into the forest,
<>hunting. While resting on the banks of river Sarayu1
<>he heard a sound like that of an elephant drinking
<>water in the river. Without realising the fact that the
<>voice was that of the son of a muni filling water in a
<>pot for his aged parents, the King released an arrow
<>against him. When Da aratha walked to the spot, he
<>realised his mistake. He had hit unknowingly a brahmin-
<>boy, a muni's son. The boy lay wounded about to
<>die. The boy explained to Das4aratha who he was and
<>how he had come to the river to carry water to his
<>aged parents. After telling the King details about him
<>he breathed his last. Sobbing at his misadventure,
<>Das4aratha went to the aged parents of the dead boy
<>with the pot filled with water. The parents, who were
<>blind thought that it was their son who was
<>approaching them when Das4aratha revealed the sad
<>story to them. After cursing Das4aratha that he too
<>would die of separation from his son, the aged muni
<>expired; his wife also died in his funeral pyre. The
<>grief-stricken King returned to Ayodhya1.
<NI>Only Vasis2t2ha and Sumantra were told about the
<>curse, which, though a cause for great sorrow, implied
<>that Das4aratha would have sons. Vasis2t2ha, therefore,
<>advised Da aratha to get the yajn5a, called putraka1mes2t2i
<>performed by R2s2ya r2n3ga. Accordingly the King invited
<>his daughter S4a1nta1 and his son-in-law, R2s2yas4r2n3ga
<>to Ayodhya1, and the yajn5a began. R2s2yas4r2n3ga made
<>offerings in the sacred fire chanting the putraka1ma
<>hymn. Then a divine person arose from the fire with a
<>golden vessel full of pudding (nectar of the Devas) and
<>disappeared again in the fire after giving the vessel to
<>R2s2yas4r2n3ga. R2s2yas4r2n3ga handed it over to Das4ara-
<>tha, who as advised by the mahars2i divided the pudd-
<>ing between Kausalya1 and Kaikeyi1. They gave a part
<>of their shares of the pudding to Sumitra1 also. The
<>three queens conceived, and in due course of time
<>Kausalya1 and Kaikeyi1 delivered a son each and
<>Sumitra1 two sons. The son of Kausalya1 was named
<>Ra1ma, the son of Kaikeyi1, Bharata, and sons of Sumitra1
<>were named Laks2man2a and S4atrughna. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Boons granted to Kaikeyi.%} Before the sons were born to
<>Das4aratha, the mighty asura called S4ambara once
<>attacked Devaloka. Das4aratha was at that time known
<>as Nemi, and he was a great friend of Indra, and on
<>his invitation Nemi, along with Kaikeyi1, went to
<>Devaloka in a chariot. Nemi killed the asura army
<>within half an hour. Then S4ambara assumed the
<>form of ten S4ambaras and attacked Nemi from ten
<>points. In this context Nemi turned and twisted his
<>chariot in all the ten directions at the same time and
<>killed all the ten S4ambaras and recaptured Svarga. It
<>was from that day onwards that Nemi came to be known
<>as Das4aratha.
<NI>In the fight with the Sambaras on all points Das4aratha's
<>chariot was so violently shaken that the key of its axle
<>was about to slip off and fall down. Noticing the
<>threatened danger Kaikeyi1 applied her finger to the [Page632-a+ 65]
<>proper place of the axle and thus averted the mishap.
<>When Das4aratha knew about this timely action of
<>Kaikeyi1 he was so very pleased that he asked her to
<>choose any two boons she desired, and she asked him
<>to keep the boons with him to be granted whenever
<>she requested for them. Das4aratha and Kaikeyi1 took
<>leave of Indra and returned to Ayodhya1. (Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a).
<NI>5) {%In the company of Vis4va1mitra.%} The four sons of
<>Das4aratha grew up in Ayodhya1. Though they were
<>equally friendly to one another, intimacy between Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a and also between Bharata and S4atrughna
<>came to be thicker. Once Vis4va1mitra decided to con-
<>duct a yajn5a for the happiness and contentment of all
<>people. At the very commencement of the yajn5a, Ra1ks2asas,
<>in batches, tried to spoil it, and Ma1ri1ca and Suba1hu,
<>sons of Ta1t2aka1 were the leaders of the obstructionists.
<>Vis4va1mitra knew that Ra1ma was the most effective
<>weapon against the Ra1ks2asas and requested Das4aratha
<>to lend him Ra1ma's help. Das4aratha felt sad about it
<>and Vis4va1mitra was getting excited over the former's
<>attitude when Vasis2t2ha advised Das4aratha to send Ra1ma
<>along with Vis4va1mitra. Accordingly Das4aratha sent
<>Ra1ma to the forest in the company of Vis4va1mitra.
<>Laks2man2a too followed his brother.
<NI>While walking in the forest Vis4va1mitra related many
<>old stories to Ra1ma and Laks2man2a. They crossed
<>river Sarayu1, passed by many a1s4ramas of munis and
<>reached the Pa1la forest. Here Vis4va1mitra imparted to
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, who felt too weak on account
<>of hunger and thirst the two mantras Bala1 and Atibala1,
<>which would ward off hunger and thirst. He also
<>taught them the use of certain rare arrows. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>was specially taught the use of a divine arrow called
<>Jr2mbhaka1stra.
<NI>6) {%Ta1t2aka1 killed.%} While Vis4va1mitra was relating to
<>them the story of Ta1t2aka1, who dwelt in the forest, they
<>saw the fierce Ra1ks2asi1 coming fast with a long spear in
<>her hand. She threw a big rock at Vis4va1mitra. Ra1ma
<>shattered the rock with an arrow. Next, Ta1t2aka1 dashed
<>forward against Ra1ma roaring furiously, and Ra1ma,
<>with another arrow killed her. The soul of the dead
<>Ta1t2aka1 assumed the form of a Gandharva woman and
<>ascended to heaven.
<NI>7) {%Salvation to Ahalya1.%} Ra1ks2asas like Suba1hu lined up
<>to obstruct the yajn5a, which Vis4va1mitra began after
<>the killing of Ta1t2aka1. Ra1ma killed Suba1hu; Ma1ri1ca ran
<>away in fright and hid himself in the sea. Ra1ma drove
<>away the other Ra1ks2asas.
<NI>Next, Vis4va1mitra, hearing about the Svayam3vara of
<>Si1ta1, daughter of King Janaka started for his palace with
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a, and on the way he told the boys
<>many Pura1n2ic stories. They bathed in the river Gan3ga1
<>and a short walk took them to the vacant a1s4rama of
<>Gautama. The great muni called Gautama had once
<>lived in this a1s4rama with his dutiful wife Ahalya1 and
<>their son S4ata1nanda, an erudite scholar in all sciences.
<>Indra, who lost his head over the great beauty of Ahalya1
<>went to the a1s4rama one midnight in the form of a
<>cock and crew. Thinking it was already dawn Gautama
<>went to the river for bath when Indra assumed the
<>form of the muni, entered his bed room and slept with
<>Ahalya1. When Gautama understood the fraud thus
<>played upon him, he cursed her into a stone. She was
<>to resume her old form when, during Treta1yuga, S4ri1 [Page632-b+ 65]
<>Ra1ma trod upon the stone. Accordingly, as soon as
<>Ra1ma trod on the stone Ahalya1 cast off her form as stone
<>and resumed her old form as Ahalya1. Immediately
<>Gautama and S4ata1nanda also appeared on the scene.
<>Ahalya1 ascended to the sky as a devi1.
<NI>8) {%Marriage.%} Vls4va1mitra came to king Janaka's palace
<>with Ra1ma and Laks2man2a. Janaka's daughter Si1ta1 and
<>his younger brothers' daughters Ma1n2d2avi1, U1rmila1 and
<>S4rutaki1rti were living in the palace as sisters and very
<>good friends. One day the princesses who were playing
<>in the garden could not pluck jasmine flowers from a
<>height. Si1ta1 then brought the S4aivaca1pa (S4iva's bow)
<>from the weapon-room and shot down Jasmine flowers
<>with it. As Janaka watched Si1ta1's action of shooting
<>with the S4aivaca1pa an idea came into his head. He
<>announced that the hero, who succeeded in shoot-
<>ing with S4aivaca1pa, would be given Si1ta1 in marriage.
<NI>Just as Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were inseparable compan-
<>ions Si1ta1 and U1rmila1 were always to be found together
<>and Ma1n2d2avi1 and S4rutaki1rti were particular friends.
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma shot an arrow from S4iva's bow and he was
<>selected as Si1ta1's husband. Janaka informed Das4aratha
<>of the marriage and he came with his attendants.
<>Bharata married Ma1n2d2avi1, Laks2man2a, U1rmila1 and
<>S4atrughna, S4rutaki1rti. After living in Mithila1 for some-
<>time Das4aratha and others returned to Ayodhya1. Vis4va1-
<>mitra went to the Hima1layas for rest.
<NI>9) {%Paras4ura1ma's threat.%} Das4aratha and others on their
<>way back to Ayodhya1 passed the Videha kingdom and
<>reached the suburbs of Bha1rgava1s4rama. All of a sudden
<>a shining form of a brahmin with Ks2atriya effulgence
<>appeared in front of the procession. Vasis2t2ha under-
<>stood that it was Paras4ura1ma and Das4aratha and
<>others were alarmed. Paras4ura1ma approached S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>who was viewing the former with quiet serenity. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma was very angry that Ra1ma broke the bow of S4iva
<>who was his (Paras4ura1ma's) preceptor. All Ra1ma's con-
<>ciliatory talk failed to pacify Paras4ura1ma, who spoke
<>thus to Ra1ma: “You, impudent fellow! you insulted
<>me and my preceptor. All right, let me see your power.
<>Take this my bow, and shoot with it.”
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma took hold of the bow and bent it easily and
<>fixing an arrow on it asked Paras4ura1ma to point out the
<>target for it. As Paras4ura1ma feared that if the arrow
<>was sent, it might crush the whole univese, he asked
<>Ra1ma so choose the result of his (Paras4ura1ma's) tapas
<>as target for the arrow. Both the bow and the arrow
<>were of Vis2n2u's power. That power as well as his own
<>Vais2n2ava power, Paras4ura1ma transferred to S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and having thus fulfilled the object of his incarnation
<>Paras4ura1ma went to Pun2ya1s4rama for permanent tapas.
<NI>10) {%Ruin of the country.%} Das4aratha decided to install S4ri1
<>Ra1ma as crown prince. The people whole-heartedly
<>welcomed it. During the night previous to the corona-
<>tion, while the wives of Das4aratha were gladly discussing
<>the happy incident, Manthara1, the tale-bearing maid of
<>Kaikeyi1 advised her mistress to prevail upon Das4aratha
<>to exile Ra1ma into the forest and install Bharata as
<>crown prince. Manthara1 also reminded Kaikeyi1 about
<>the boons, which had been promised to her by Das4aratha
<>during the deva1sura war. Kaikeyi1 fell into the trap
<>thus set by Manthara1. Kaikeyi1 put on a wrathful face and
<>shut herself up in a room. When Das4aratha enquired
<>of her the reason for her anger she asked him to make
<>her son Bharata, the crown prince and exile Ra1ma for [Page633-a+ 65]
<>fourteen years' life in forest. The king fainted when
<>he heard the demand But, S4ri1 Ra1ma, on hearing about
<>it, put on an anchorite's apparel and got ready to start
<>for the forest. Si1ta1 and Laks2man2a also got ready to
<>follow Ra1ma into the forest. While the entire popula-
<>tion of Ayodhya1 stood there weeping, Ra1ma, Laks2man2a
<>and Si1ta1 wearing the forest-dwellers' garb started for the
<>forest.
<NI>11) {%Death of Das4aratha and Bharata's decision.%} As soon
<>as Sumantra, who had accompanied Ra1ma and others
<>returned to Ayodhya1, Das4aratha expired on account
<>of unbearable grief caused by Ra1ma's exile. Messengers
<>brought to Ayodhya1 Bharata and S4atrughna from Kekaya
<>where they were put up with their uncle Yudha1jit at
<>the time of their father's death. But, they were kept in
<>the dark of all that had happened in their absence till
<>their arrival at the palace. Bharata, who heard of every-
<>thing from his mother was greatly upset and got ready
<>to go to Ra1ma in the forest. S4atrughna too got ready
<>to accompany him. Arundhati1 and Vasis2t2ha in a chariot
<>in the fore-front, Kausalya1 and Sumitra1 in another
<>chariot just behind the first one, Bharata and S4atrughna
<>behind them--in this manner the great journey into the
<>forest started. Leaving all others behind him, Bharata
<>went forward and prostrated before Ra1ma and Laks2-
<>man2a at Citraku1t2a. S4ri1 Ra1ma broke into tears on hear-
<>ing about the death of their father. But in spite of
<>Bharata's pressing request Ra1ma refused to return to
<>Ayodhya1. At last Bharata yielded to Ra1ma's injunction
<>and returned to Ayodhya1 with the latter's sandals. But
<>he did not enter the palace; instead he built an a1s4rama
<>at Nandigra1ma and worshipping Ra1ma's sandals lived
<>there.
<NI>12) {%Trip to Pan5cavat2i1.%} From Mount Citraku1t2a S4ri1
<>Ra1ma and others started towards the forest. When they
<>continued their journey after visiting the Sage Atri's
<>a1s4rama a Ra1ks2asa called Vira1dha ran away carrying
<>off Si1ta1. Ra1ma killed Vira1dha and regained Si1ta1. Then
<>they visited the a1s4rama of sage S4arabhan3ga in the
<>Kumuda forest. Therefrom they went to the Mr2kan2d2u
<>forest where they visited mahars2i Agastya, and there
<>Ra1ma took the vow to kill Ra1van2a and other evil Ra1-
<>ks2asas and thus render the land safe for sages to perform
<>tapas. Agastya presented to Ra1ma a Vais2n2ava bow, a
<>Bra1hma arrow and a S4aiva quiver. Ra1ma kept them
<>with Agastya himself to be given to him when required.
<>Then Agastya gave Ra1ma a divine ornament such as
<>was not available in all the three worlds. Ra1ma tied it
<>round Si1ta1's neck. Taking leave of Agastya, Ra1ma and
<>others went to the Dan2d2aka forest. It was on a high peak
<>of Mount Maha1kraun5ca in the forest that Jat2a1yu,
<>brother of Sampa1ti and a very close friend of Ra1ma
<>lived. Ra1ma and Jat2a1yu renewed their old frindship and
<>decided to be of mutual service in future. After that
<>Ra1ma and others rested themselves on the banks of
<>the near-by Goda1vari1.
<NI>13) {%Stay at Pan5cavat2i1.%} Pan5cavat2i1 was on the southern
<>bank of the Goda1vari1. Five vat2as (peepal trees) of the
<>same size stood there in a circle, and so the place was
<>called Pan5cavat2i1. (See under Pan5cavat2i1). S4ri1 Ra1ma de-
<>cided to build his a1s4rama at the centre of those trees.
<>Laks2man2a cut down an ebony tree there to put up a
<>parn2as4a1la1 (hut) At once the log disappeared and the
<>dead body of a Ra1ks2asa youth was found there. It was
<>the corpse of S4ambhukuma1ra, son of S4u1rpan2akha1. He [Page633-b+ 65]
<>was performing tapas there to propitiate S4iva when he
<>was overcome by the beauty of Si1ta1 and to look at her
<>from a hidden spot he had assumed the form of the
<>ebony tree. It was him that Laks2man2a had cut down.
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma understood the situation and explained to his
<>wife and brother about the trickeries of the Ra1ks2asas.
<>Then the parn2as4a1la1 was constructed and they lived
<>there. Hearing about the coming of Ra1ma all the sages
<>of the Dan2d2aka forest visited them. They lived in
<>Pan5cavat2i1 for thirteen years.
<NI>14) {%Test by Parames4vara (S4iva) and Pa1rvati1.%} Parames4-
<>vara and Pa1rvati1, who knew that many tricky changes
<>would occur in the thirteenth year of the life of Ra1ma
<>and Si1ta1 there, decided to submit them to a test. The
<>object of the test was to see whether Ra1ma and Si1ta1
<>would recognise each other under all circumstances.
<>When Si1ta1 one day entered the river Goda1vari1 to
<>fetch water, she saw two swans enjoying themselves in
<>a lotus pool in the middle of a sand-shoal in the river.
<>When Si1ta1 went near the pool she saw Ra1ma bathing
<>in it. But on a closer look she recognised that it was
<>not Ra1ma, but S4iva, in the guise of Ra1ma, who was
<>bathing there. To befool Si1ta1 S4iva, who was disguised
<>as Ra1ma, told her:--Dear one! Please come to me
<>quickly. Why were you so late?
<NI>Si1ta1:--Oh, Deva! salutations. Why did you alone
<>come to the bath?
<NI>Ra1ma:--I had to come alone as Devi1 did not come
<>with me at once and was late in coming.
<NI>Si1ta1:--Why did not the Devi1 come? You two are
<>unique. Devi1 might be alone at Kaila1sa just now. It
<>was not good that you did not bring her also with you.
<NI>S4iva: Oh great Devi1! salutations to your divine
<>greatness. Let me return to Kaila1sa after saluting S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. Hail unto thee.
<NI>Meanwhile S4ri1 Ra1ma was waiting impatiently for Si1ta1 to
<>return. Then Si1ta1 approached him looking into a lotus
<>flower she held in her hand and also throwing, off and
<>on, amorous glances at him. (She was in fact Pa1rvati1
<>in the guise of Si1ta1). And she told Ra1ma:--My Lord!
<>you would excuse my delay in returning. The delay was
<>due to my tarrying there to look at the play of two swans.
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma looked closely and recognised that it was not
<>Si1ta1 and replied as follows:--Oh Devi1! my salutations.
<>Did you come alone? Where is Deva? How is it that
<>you are separated from him? Maha1deva and Maha1devi1
<>are one and inseparable. Then how this separation?
<>Si1ta1 (Pa1rvati1):--Salutations. Thou art omniscient and
<>omnipotent. I return to the presence of S4iva.
<NI>15) {%The incident of S4u1rpan2akha1.%} S4u1rpan2akha1 was the
<>wife of a Ra1ks2asa called Vidyujjihva. Once in a war
<>which Ra1van2a, Vidyujjihva and other Ra1ks2asas fought
<>at Devaloka Vidyujjihva was killed by mistake. Ra1van2a,
<>therefore, permitted S4u1rpan2akha1 to choose whomsoever
<>she liked as her husband, and she went about the
<>world in search of a suitable husband. She liked some
<>persons, but they did not like her, and vice versa. Thus
<>she was roaming about discontented. She was also on
<>the look-out for an opportunity to take vengeance on
<>Laks2man2a for killing her son, S4ambhukuma1ra.
<NI>S4u1rpan2akha1, who heard about the beauty of Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a came to Pan5cavat2i1 disguised as Lalita1. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma alone was there in the a1s4rama at the time and
<>she told him that she was love-sick. S4ri1 Ra1ma rejected
<>her prayer on the plea that he was already married. [Page634-a+ 65]
<>Then she approached Laks2man2a with the same request.
<>He too refused to oblige her. Then she saw Si1ta1 there
<>and decided to shatter her married life and also to make
<>a present of her to Ra1van2a. She also thought that if
<>Si1ta1 were got rid of she would have Ra1ma for husband.
<>Maddened by such thoughts she rushed into the a1s4rama.
<>But, Laks2man2a drove her out. Then, carrying
<>Laks2man2a with her she rose into the sky and he cut away
<>both her ears, breasts and nose. Thus disfigured she
<>resumed her form of Ra1ks2asi1. She flew away in the sky
<>roaring loudly.
<NI>16) {%Khara killed.%} Having heard about the disfigure-
<>ment of S4u1rpan2akha1 Khara sent fourteen Ra1ks2asas to
<>Ra1ma's a1s4rama. Laks2man2a killed them very easily.
<>Next, Khara, his brothers Du1s2an2a and Tris4iras with
<>fourteen thousand Ra1ks2asa soldiers came to fight Ra1ma.
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a killed them also. This saddened
<>S4u1rpan2akha1 very much and she reported the entire
<>affair to Ra1van2a at Lan3ka1. She told him that Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a were very courageous warriors and he was
<>not to enter into direct fighting with them, but was to
<>abduct Si1ta1 whose loss would cause Ra1ma's death. She
<>also assured Ra1van2a that if Ra1ma died, Laks2man2a
<>would himself end his life.
<NI>17) {%Si1ta1 abducted.%} Next day a spotted deer was found
<>playing near the a1s4rama. Si1ta1 desired to have the deer
<>and S4ri1 Ra1ma, after asking his brother to take care of
<>Si1ta1, followed the deer, which enticed him to a great
<>distance in the forest. At last, finding it difficult to
<>catch the deer alive, Ra1ma shot an arrow at it. Hit by
<>the arrow the deer transformed itself into a gigantic
<>Ra1ks2asa and fell down dead crying. “Oh! Si1ta1 O!
<>Laks2man2a, a Ra1ks2asa is killing me. Come and save
<>me.”
<NI>The Ra1ks2asa, who thus fell a prey to Ra1ma's arrow was
<>really Ma1ri1ca, uncle of Ra1van2a. Ma1ri1ca had
<>gone in the form of a deer to Ra1ma's a1s4rama at the
<>instance of his nephew to cheat Ra1ma. Si1ta1 heard the
<>false cry of Ma1ri1ca and asked Laks2man2a to hurry up
<>to the spot for Ra1ma's protection. Laks2man2a at first
<>did not want to leave Si1ta1 there alone and go after
<>Ra1ma. But, when she used hard and cruel words
<>against him Laks2man2a quitted the a1s4rama and went
<>into the forest. When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were thus
<>absent at the a1s4rama an old Sannya1sin came for alms
<>at the courtyard. Si1ta1, who came out to offer alms
<>was forcibly carried away by Ra1van2a (the sannya1sin
<>was Ra1van2a in disguise) in his pus2paka aerial chariot
<>to Lan3ka1. On the way Jat2a1yu saw Ra1van2a and put
<>up a fight with him to get Si1ta1 released. But, Jat2a1yu
<>had to fall down wounded by the sword of Ra1van2a and
<>he lay there awaiting Ra1ma's arrival.
<NI>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a returned to the a1s4rama only to
<>find Si1ta1 missing. While they advanced some distance
<>lamenting over the loss of Si1ta1 they saw Jat2a1yu lying
<>in the forest, his wings cut, but happy in expectation
<>of salvation and repeating the name of Ra1ma. Jat2a1yu
<>gave Ra1ma all details about Si1ta1 and then gave up his
<>body and ascended to Vaikun2t2ha.
<NI>18) {%Salvation to Kabandha.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a moved
<>towards the south in quest of Si1ta1. An asura woman
<>called Ayomukhi1, sister of S4u1rapadma tried to entice
<>Laks2man2a, who went alone to a pool to fetch water.
<>When Laks2man2a resisted and kept away from her
<>allurements, she tried to carry him away into the sky. [Page634-b+ 65]
<>But, he drove her away disfigured. When the brothers
<>continued their search for Si1ta1 they were caught in the
<>arms stretched out in semi-circular form. It was a
<>Ra1ks2asa called Kabandha, and they cut away one arm
<>each. At once the fierce Kabandha (headless body)
<>form disappeared and a Gandharva youth appeared in
<>his place. After offering moks2a to Kabandha Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a continued their search for Si1ta1. (See
<>under Kabandha).
<NI>19) {%Salvation to S4abari1.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a reached
<>S4abarya1s4rama and were duly received by the female
<>hermit S4abari1. She presented them with fruits. Not
<>only that, she personally tasted each fruit for its quality
<>and then gave the best to the guests. Ra1ma was so very
<>pleased with her pure devotion that he offered her
<>salvation. (For details see under S4abari1).
<NI>20) {%Ra1ma-Sugriva alliance.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>bathed in the Pampa1 river and thus refreshed they
<>travelled upto the height of Mount R2s2yamu1ka where
<>Sugri1va lived with Hanu1ma1n as his Prime Minister.
<>Sugri1va, who saw Ra1ma and Laks2man2a coming, deputed
<>Hanu1ma1n to find out whether they were friends or
<>foes. Hanu1ma1n, in the guise of a brahmin boy talked
<>with them, who related their story from the abduction
<>of Si1ta1. Having understood the matters Hanu1ma1n re-
<>sumed his actual form and carried Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>on his shoulders into the presence of Sugri1va.
<NI>Sugri1va related to Ra1ma the story of his expulsion
<>from Kis2kindha1 by Ba1li, his elder brother. Sugri1va
<>wanted a powerful ally to recapture the country. Simi-
<>larly S4ri1 Ra1ma too wanted a powerful ally to regain
<>Si1ta1. So both the parties entered into an alliance,
<>Ra1ma undertaking to kill Ba1li and restore his kingdom
<>and his wife to Sugri1va and Sugri1va undertaking to
<>search for and find out Si1ta1 for Ra1ma.
<NI>Though the above pact was made, Sugri1va was doubt-
<>ful about Ra1ma's capacity to honour his part of the
<>contract, and Ra1ma, knowing this suspicion of Sugri1va,
<>wanted to dispel it. The mountain-like body of Dun-
<>dubhi, the Ra1ks2asa killed by Ba1li, lay there in a big
<>heap of bones and at the instance of Ra1ma, Laks2man2a
<>threw it into the distant southern sea with the big toe
<>of his left foot. Sugri1va was wonder-struck at this feat
<>of Laks2man2a and praised him. Yet Sugri1va was not
<>quite cured of his doubt and Ra1ma wanted to further
<>convince him of their prowess.
<NI>There were seven big trees there known as Saptasa1las.
<>Ba1li used to wrestle with the trees due to his overflowing
<>vitality and power. (See under Saptasa1la). S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>went near the trees and suddenly fixed an arrow on his
<>bow-string and shot it by drawing the bow, with the
<>big toe of his right foot pressed against a rock. The
<>arrow cut down the seven trees at one and the same
<>time and then automatically returned to its quiver.
<>Sugri1va was taken aback by this marvellous show of
<>power.
<NI>21) {%Exhibition of ornaments.%} They came again to
<>R2s2yamu1ka1cala and Sugri1va placed before Ra1ma a
<>bundle of ornaments and said that it was dropped down
<>by a weeping woman from an aerial chariot, which had,
<>a few days back, passed above the mountain. Ra1ma
<>recognised them as Si1ta1's ornaments, shed tears and sat
<>there motionless for some time. At last Sugri1va and
<>Laks2man2a consoled him and he handed over the bundle
<>of ornaments to Laks2man2a. [Page635-a+ 65]
<NI>22) {%Kingdom restored to Sugri1va.%} The very next day
<>Sugri1va took Ra1ma to Kis2kindha1, and the former
<>challenged Ba1li for a combat. Ra1ma, from a distance,
<>viewed the fierce fight between the brothers, but he
<>could not do anything as it was impossible to distinguish
<>between Ba1li and Sugri1va on account of their very
<>close resemblance. Sugri1va, who was defeated in the
<>first round and retired from fight felt angry towards
<>Ra1ma, but was soon satisfied with Ra1ma's explanation
<>for his inaction. To distinguish Sugri1va from Ba1li S4ri1
<>Rama, the next day, put a garland on the former's neck
<>and wearing the garland Sugriva challenged Ba1li a
<>second time to a duel. Though Ba1li's wife, Ta1ra1,
<>this time prevented him from accepting the challenge
<>Ba1li paid no heed to her protests and rushed forth for
<>the duel.
<NI>Ba1li and Sugri1va fought again, and this time Ra1ma
<>from his concealment behind a tree shot an arrow at
<>the chest of Ba1li. The arrow felled him. Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a then came into the open and Ba1li spoke
<>disparagingly to Ra1ma about shooting the arrow from
<>concealment. Ra1ma answered him saying that if he
<>had seen him (Ra1ma) face to face he would have
<>become his devotee and he had to shoot Ba1li from his
<>hiding place as it was not proper to kill one's devotees.
<>At last, after handing over charge of his wife and son
<>An3gada, to Sugri1va, Ba1li breathed his last. S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>decided to crown Sugri1va as King and install An3gada
<>as crown prince and returned to R2s2yamu1ka1cala for
<>rest after entrusting, under the supervision of Laks2man2a,
<>Hanu1ma1n and Ja1mbava1n with the duty of making
<>preparations for the coronation. Though Sugri1va
<>invited S4ri1 Ra1ma to Kis2kindha1 when preparations for
<>coronation were over, the latter declined the invitation
<>gracefully and deputed Laks2man2a to represent him at
<>the ceremony. Laks2man2a installed Sugri1va as the
<>Maha1ra1ja, An3gada as crown prince, Ruma1 as queen
<>and Ta1ra1 as queen-mother. Also, Hanu1ma1n was
<>appointed as Sugri1va's minister. Those things over,
<>Laks2man2a returned to Ra1ma at R2s2yamu1ka1cala.
<NI>23) {%Laks2man2a's wrath.%} The next four months were
<>rainy period. Even after that Sugri1va did not make
<>necessary arrangements to search for Si1ta1. At Ra1ma's
<>instance Laks2man2a went to Kis2kindha1 to enquire about
<>the reason for the delay. The monkeys were alarmed
<>by the grave appearance of Laks2man2a and Ta1ra1 came
<>out and apologised to him. Arrangements were soon
<>finalised for the quest of Si1ta1. Armies of many lakhs
<>of monkeys were deputed to the eight regions to search
<>for Si1ta1. Sus2en2a was appointed chief of the army for
<>the west, S4atabali for the north, Vinata for the east and
<>An3gada for the south. As the south was the chief
<>place for the search, monkeys like Hanu1ma1n, Ja1mbava1n,
<>Vivida, Nala, Nila, Kumuda, each of them an expert
<>in various ways, were appointed chiefs of different
<>matters. Every chief and his assistant was given
<>suitable instructions by Laks2man2a and Sugri1va, and
<>accordingly the army of monkeys began its march
<>under the leadership of Hanu1ma1n.
<NI>24) {%Words of recognition.%} To convince Si1ta1 that it was
<>really the emissary of Ra1ma who went to her the latter
<>imparted to Hanu1ma1n the following three sentences for
<>timely use.
<NI>(i) “When I took leave of you for life in exile in the
<>forest you (Si1ta1) who were then in the inner apartment [Page635-b+ 65]
<>dressed in ordinary fashion came out in the same dress
<>prepared to follow me saying ‘I too...’ feigning anger’.
<NI>(ii) When, for out life in the forest, we had left the
<>city and approached a shrubbery, S4i1ta1 in her childish
<>ignorance and goodness of heart told me “This place
<>will do for our forest life.”
<NI>(iii) While she was one day massaging my leg in our
<>bedroom she threw away from her finger the ring
<>studded with stones. When I asked her the reason for
<>it she answered me as follows:--This ring studded with
<>stones may prove to be of danger to me. When your
<>feet touched the hard granite rock it turned out into a
<>world beauty (Ahalya1). Under the circumstances how
<>much more beautiful would be the woman, who would
<>be created by the touch of your foot on the beautiful
<>stone of the ring? And, because of that beauty you
<>may...me...and then...”. We two--I and Si1ta1--alone
<>knew about the above incident.
<NI>Carrying thus S4ri1 Ra1ma's signet ring and words of re-
<>cognition Hanu1ma1n went along with the army, which
<>started for the south. Sugri1va gave one month's time
<>to the searching parties to find out Si1ta1 and warned
<>them that their throats would be cut if they failed in
<>their mission.
<NI>25) {%Saw Svayamprabha1.%} An3gada, Hanu1ma1n, Ja1mbava1n
<>and others during their search came to an extensive
<>forest. They were dead tired with hunger and thirst.
<>The leader of the party looked about for something to
<>eat and drink when he saw small birds flying up from
<>a distant pit. From drops of water falling from the
<>wings of the birds it was inferred that the pit contained
<>water. When Hanu1ma1n and others entered the pit
<>(cave) and walked a great distance they came to a
<>spacious garden. They were astonished to find a solitary
<>beauty there, and she related to them her autobiography
<>as follows:--
<NI>I am the faithful maid of Rambha1. The powerful asura
<>called Catura1sya wanted me to procure Rambha1 for
<>him and he got this garden city built by Maya1ca1rya,
<>the architect of the Daityas, for me as reward for my
<>service to him in the matter of Rambha1. Various kinds
<>of gems light this place and creepers and trees supply
<>food materials. Catua1rsya, I and Rambha1 alone were
<>living here. But, Indra came to know of it, came here,
<>killed Catura1sya and took away Rambha1 with him.
<>He cursed me to lead a solitary life here as punish-
<>ment for having helped Catura1sya. I prayed for redemp-
<>tion from the curse and Indra told me, that after
<>thousands of years a company of monkeys would come
<>here in search of Si1ta1 and that after entertaining them
<>with food I must see Ra1ma and then return to Svarga.
<>I have thus been awaiting your arrival and now I am
<>leaving the place, which will vanish as soon as I quit
<>it. All of you, please stand there with eyes closed and
<>I shall send you back to the place where you were
<>before coming here.
<NI>Accordingly the monkeys stood there with eyes closed
<>and when they opened their eyes there was neither the
<>garden city nor Svayamprabha1 there but they were
<>standing in the old plain. Svayamprabha1 appeared
<>before Ra1ma, praised him and then went to Svarga.
<NI>26) {%Met Sampa1ti.%} The monkeys again went southward,
<>reached Mahendragiri and descending on its southern
<>side came to the shores of the southern sea. They could
<>advance no further to the south. They were suffering [Page636-a+ 65]
<>from great hunger and thirst and if they returned with
<>no tangible information about Si1ta1, Sugri1va would kill
<>them. They preferred death by fasting on the seashore
<>to death by the sword of Sugri1va.
<NI>Having decided thus the monkeys spread darbha grass
<>on the extensive plain of Mahendra mountain and lay
<>on the grass to die. In a large cave in the mountain
<>was living Sampa1ti. The huge bird Sampa1ti was star-
<>ving without food and was not able to fly as it had lost
<>its wings. But it dragged itself to the mouth of the cave
<>and saw the monkeys lying there awaiting death, and
<>it thought of eating the monkeys one by one. The
<>monkeys, who understood this idea of Sampa1ti cursed
<>their fate and sang the praise of Jat2a1yu.
<NI>Hearing the word ‘Jat2a1yu’ Sampa1ti approached the
<>monkeys, who related to him the object of their journey.
<>Being told about the death of Jat2a1yu. Sampa1ti
<>shed tears and told the monkeys as follows:-
<NI>Jat2a1yu was my younger brother. Our mother was Maha1-
<>s4veta1 and father Su1ryadeva. On account of the boon of
<>our parents I was King of all the birds and Jat2a1yu the
<>crown Prince. As our brotherliness grew thicker our
<>haughtiness due to our power and speed also increased.
<>Once we flew up towards the orbit of the Sun to see him,
<>our father. In his youthful enthusiasm my younger
<>brother, Jat2a1yu, climbed higher up in the sky leaving
<>me behind. Due to the heat of the Sun his wings lost
<>their power and energy. Then, to save him, I flew up
<>above him and shaded him. Therefore he could descend
<>to the earth without his wings being burned and thus
<>killed. But, my wings got burned and I fell down on
<>the Mahendra mountain and got my legs broken. Thus
<>I lost the power either to fly or to walk.
<NI>I stayed here as the attendant of Nis4a1kara Mahars2i,
<>who could divine the future also. He told me the story
<>about Ra1ma's incarnation. He told me further that
<>monkeys in search of Si1ta1 would come here when I
<>should tell them where Si1ta1 was and that then I would
<>regain my health.”
<NI>After telling the monkeys the above facts Sampa1ti, with
<>their cooperation, performed the obsequies of Jat2a1yu.
<>Then the King of birds (Sampa1ti) raised its head and
<>surveyed the ocean and he saw the following: Mountain
<>Subela in the heart of the southern sea; the plain at
<>the heights of the mountain constituting the base of
<>Lan3ka1; in the centre of Lan3ka1 there was Ra1van2a's
<>capital; nearby the ladies' quarters; near the quarters
<>the as4oka garden; at the centre of the garden the
<>s4im3s4apa1 tree and under the tree Si1ta1devi1.
<NI>As soon as Sampa1ti had finished telling the monkeys
<>the above details he regained his health.
<NI>Sampa1ti told the monkeys another story also as follows:-
<>Ra1van2a once abducted a Yaks2a beauty from Alaka1puri1
<>and carried her away in his Pus2paka Vima1na.
<>Sampa1ti clashed with Ra1van2a on his way and destroyed
<>his plane. But the plane, which was self-generating
<>came again into existence. Sampa1ti threw away by
<>its beak the Candraha1sa (Ra1van2a's sword) and kicked
<>his crown down. At last, at the request of Ra1van2a, he
<>and Sampa1ti signed a non-aggression pact. That was
<>the reason why Sampa1ti could not fight Ra1van2a in
<>person.
<NI>27) {%Hanu1ma1n saw Si1ta1.%} An3gada said that for the search
<>for Si1ta1 in Lan3ka1 as told by Sampa1ti, some one should
<>jump across the ocean. Though many a monkey tried to [Page636-b+ 65]
<>do so it was Hanu1ma1n, who succeeded in crossing the sea.
<>At one jump he reached the heights of Mahendragiri
<>whence he took another jump forward. But, midway
<>Surasa1, mother of the na1gas, swallowed him, and he
<>came out through her ear and continued his journey
<>towards Lan3ka1. When he had advanced some more
<>distance an evil spirit called Cha1ya1gra1hin2i1 obstructed
<>his way by a mysterious attack on his shadow.
<>Hanu1ma1n quickly understood what had happened and
<>killed the evil spirit with one kick of his left foot. He
<>again continued his flight. But, he very soon became
<>weak and exhausted. Then Mount Maina1ka emerged
<>from the ocean and fed Hanu1ma1n with fruits and roots.
<>He reached Lan3ka1 at dusk. He defeated Lan3ka1laks2mi1,
<>who tried to prevent his entry into the city. In fact
<>Lan3ka1laks2mi1 was Vijayalaks2mi1, who had been cursed
<>by Brahma1. (For details see under Vijayalaks2mi1).
<>After defeating her, who was thus absolved from the
<>curse, Hanu1ma1n saw Si1ta1 seated under the as4oka tree.
<>But, none saw him as he was perched on a tree.
<NI>28) {%Hanu1ma1n's return.%} That night Ra1van2a dressed in
<>all splendour visited Si1ta1 and tried to secure her favour
<>by soft words and cajolery, all to no purpose. Then he
<>threatened her with punishments, which too proved
<>to be of no avail. After instructing the Ra1ks2asa
<>women that Si1ta1 should be somehow brought round
<>within a month's time, Ra1van2a returned to his palace.
<NI>Ra1ks2asi1s surrounded Si1ta1 and described to her the
<>greatness and various merits of Ra1van2a. Si1ta1 continued
<>to sob. Then came there Trijat2a1, daughter of
<>Vibhi1s2an2a, the great devotee of Vis2n2u, and Sarama1,
<>to console Si1ta1. Trijat2a1 had boundless devotion to-
<>wards Ra1ma and great love for Si1ta1. She repeated
<>to Si1ta1 certain dreams she had had.
<NI>Left to herself Si1ta1 began saying to herself various
<>things regarding her past. She roferred to her infancy,
<>beginning of youth, wedding, stay at Ayodhya1, forest-
<>life and life in Pan5cavat2i1 and wept over her recurring
<>thoughts about them. Hanu1ma1n, who heard Si1ta1's
<>soliloquy completed Si1ta1's story by relating, from his
<>place on the tree, about Jat2a1yu's salvation, salvation
<>given to Kabandha and S4abari1, alliance with Sugri1va,
<>killing of Ba1li, expedition of the monkeys in search of
<>Si1ta1, meeting with Sampa1ti, himself (Hanu1ma1n) cross-
<>ing the sea and his finding out Si1ta1. Hearing the words
<>of Hanu1ma1n, Si1ta1 looked up in astonishment. Immedia-
<>tely Hanu1ma1n came down the tree and presented the
<>signet ring at Si1ta1's feet. When she examined the ring
<>her hands shook and tears dimmed her eyes. Hanu1ma1n
<>talked to her in detail and told her that he would, if
<>only Si1ta1 permitted him, carry her on his shoulders to
<>Ra1ma. He told her further that if she did not welcome
<>the idea of thus returning to Ra1ma, he would return
<>with S4ri1 Ra1ma and others, defeat Ra1van2a in war and
<>take her back. Si1ta1 was not convinced about the power
<>and prowess of Hanu1ma1n. He then increased his body
<>in size so that his limbs grew into the size of a mountain,
<>hands into that of trees, head into that of a mountain
<>peak, tail into that of a river etc. His breathing became
<>akin to a storm. Then he roared in such a manner that
<>even the very ends of the world shook and the people
<>of Lan3ka1 were awakened by it.
<NI>Si1ta1 was now absolutely convinced of Hanu1ma1n's bona
<>fides and faithfulness. She handed over to him
<>her Cu1d2a1man2i (ornament worn on the head) to be [Page637-a+ 65]
<>given to Ra1ma and also told him the following three
<>words of recognition so that Ra1ma might be all the
<>more convinced.
<NI>(1) When Ra1ma first came to the garden near the
<>palace in Mithila1 I (Si1ta1) saw his reflection in the
<>blue mirror in the veranda of my palace and the
<>beauty of the reflection attracted me. I looked towards
<>the garden to see the original of the reflection. Then he
<>(Ra1ma) was looking down into the waters of the glass
<>pond. He also saw my face reflected in the water and
<>suddenly he looked at me. Our eyes met and in all
<>shyness I hurried to and hid myself in the ladies'
<>quarters.
<NI>(2) Before our wedding I sent him through a faithful
<>maid, a love letter to which he gave me a suitable
<>reply.
<NI>(3) After our wedding while we were living in Ayodhya1
<>when one day I returned to our bedroom after a long
<>chitchat with my younger sisters, my lord (Ra1ma) was
<>lying on the cot in feigned sleep. Quietly I went up
<>to him and kissed him on the lips. Because of the
<>pressure on his lips and as my breast then touched his
<>chest he pretended to have suddenly woken up and
<>embraced me.
<NI>Having received thus from Si1ta1 the Cu1d2a1man2i and
<>these words of recognition Hanu1ma1n took leave of Si1ta1
<>and with her implied sanction went about to have a
<>look at Lan3ka1. At one place he heard Vibhi1s2an2a
<>reciting Vis2n2u's names. After wishing that this house
<>of the devotee should turn into a royal abode he passed
<>Vibhi1s2an2a's house. Then he came to Ra1van2a's palace
<>and gathered information about the Ra1ks2asa power.
<>“Now I must see Ra1van2a in person, let him know
<>personally the fact of my visit and I would give him
<>righteous advice”--with this object in view Hanu1ma1n
<>began destroying the garden. He drove away the
<>Ra1ks2asas, who came to punish him and some of them
<>were killed. At last Meghana1da (Indrajit) attacked
<>Hanu1ma1n. Hiding in the sky he shot the Brahma1stra
<>against Hanu1ma1n, who yielded to it. The Ra1ks2asas
<>took Hanu1ma1n captive to Ra1van2a. He freed himself of
<>the cords that bound him, extended his tail which he
<>shaped into circles, one over the other so that the last
<>one rose more in height than Ra1van2a's throne and
<>seated himself on its top. Ra1van2a and Hanu1ma1n then
<>began a conversation. Ra1van2a, who got angry at the
<>disrespect shown to him by Hanu1ma1n, ordered the
<>latter to be killed, but Vibhi1s2an2a opposed it saying that
<>to kill emissaries and messengers was worse than killing
<>one's own mother. Finally Ra1van2a ordered that
<>Hanu1ma1n's tail be set fire to and he be insulted and
<>humiliated.
<NI>Immediately Ra1ks2asas began to cover Hanu1ma1n's tail
<>with clothes. But, ths tail began growing longer and
<>longer with the result that no quantity of clothings
<>sufficed to completely cover the ever-extending tail.
<>At last the Ra1ks2asas poured oil over the tail and set
<>fire to it. Then Hanu1ma1n broke loose from captivity
<>and jumped up into the air causing universal disaster by
<>fire in Lan3ka1. The fire did not affect the palace of
<>Vibhi1s2an2a and also the platform around the S4im3s4apa1
<>tree where Si1ta1 sat. After thus burning down Lan3ka1
<>Hanu1ma1n extinguished the fire on his tail by dipping it
<>in the ocean. Taking leave once again of Si1ta1,
<>Hanu1ma1n crossed the sea and reached Mahendragiri. [Page637-b+ 65]
<NI>29) {%Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va, who
<>received Hanu1ma1n's report about his visit to Lan3ka1
<>started for it with an army of monkeys. They camped
<>on the shores of the south sea. Ra1van2a held a meeting
<>of his war council attended by his brothers and others.
<>He expelled Vibhi1s2an2a, who opposed war and advised
<>his brother to return Si1ta1 to Ra1ma and to apologise to
<>him. Vibhi1s2an2a quitted Lan3ka1 and took refuge with
<>Ra1ma.
<NI>Ra1ma and others, who had assembled on the sea-shore
<>decided to build a bund to Lan3ka1. The first thing Ra1ma
<>did, for the successful conclusion of the expedition, was
<>to install a S4ivalin3ga at Ra1mes4vara. (See under Ra1mes4-
<>vara). Then he prayed to Varun2adeva for a passage
<>across the sea. But, Varun2a did not present himself
<>and S4ri1 Ra1ma, angry with him, shot the a1gneya
<>(fiery) arrow into the heart of the sea when Varun2a
<>appeared, saluted him and advised him to build a
<>bund across the sea. As a reward for Varun2a S4ri1 Ra1ma,
<>as requested by the former, killed with one arrow all
<>the Ra1ks2asas, who lived in Ga1ndha1ra island on the
<>north-western shore of the ocean. Varun2a returned to
<>his abode. The construction of the bund was begun
<>under the leadership of Sugri1va with Nala as chief
<>planner and Ni1la as his co-planner. Ja1mbava1n and
<>Hanu1ma1n functioned as supervisors and other monkeys
<>as workers. Mountains, hills, rocks etc. were brought from
<>various quarters and the construction of the bund was
<>begun.
<NI>Meanwhile, Ra1van2a sent a great magician called
<>Marutta disguised as King Janaka to Si1ta1 to convert
<>her to the side of Ra1van2a. But, the attempt failed.
<>Ra1van2a then sent his two expert spies, S4uka and
<>Sa1ran2a disguised as monkeys to Ra1ma's camp. Ja1mba-
<>va1n and Hanu1ma1n captured and brought them before
<>Sugri1va. Weepingly they both sought refuge in Ra1ma,
<>who set them free. They returned to Lan3ka1 and
<>reported matters to Ra1van2a, who felt a desire to have
<>a look at Ra1ma for which purpose he, with his attend-
<>ants, climbed to the top of the northern tower. Ra1ma,
<>who knew about it by his spies climbed the heights of
<>Subela mountain whence he stared at Ra1van2a. Their
<>eyes met in anger seeing which Sugri1va by one leap
<>reached Ra1van2a and kicked off to Ra1ma the crown
<>from the central head of Ra1van2a. After performing
<>something like a destructive dance on Ra1van2a's head
<>Sugri1va by another leap returned to Ra1ma.
<NI>Full of disappointment Ra1van2a returned to his palace.
<>His father-in-law, Ma1lyava1n, tried his best to dissuade
<>Ra1van2a from war, all to no purpose. Ra1ma sent an
<>emissary to him to ask him to send Si1ta1 back. Ra1van2a
<>declined to oblige, and immediately war began. During
<>the first day of the war, the majority of the Ra1ks2asas
<>including their great leaders like Maha1ba1hu, Maha1-
<>pa1rs4va, Mahodara, Maha1ka1ya etc were killed. On the
<>second day the Ra1ks2asa army under the command of
<>Atika1ya, son of Ra1van2a, set out from the northern
<>tower to fight. Laks2man2a killed Atika1ya with Brahma1-
<>stra. The other two Ra1ks2asa-commanders were
<>Tris4iras and Meghana1da. Laks2man2a encountered them.
<>When the latter failed to win by righteous fighting he
<>resorted to cunningness. That too did not bring victory
<>to him, and then he hid himself in the sky and shot
<>the na1ga1stra given to him by S4iva against the enemy.
<>That arrow rendered Laks2man2a, Sugri1va and all the [Page638-a+ 65]
<>monkeys unconscious. At that time Vibhi1s2an2a was away
<>to arrange for food.
<NI>When Vibhi1s2an2a returned with food he was taken
<>aback to find Laks2man2a and others lying in an uncons-
<>cious condition. Ra1ma was informed about the matter
<>and when he came to the battle-ground and saw
<>Laks2man2a, Sugri1va, Hanu1ma1n and all the others lying
<>there unconscious he lost self-confidence for a short
<>while and remarked that it was all the result of his
<>having put faith in Vibhi1s2an2a, Ra1van2a's brother whom
<>he had put in charge of the battlefield. This comment
<>of Ra1ma pained Vibhi1s2an2a much; but S4ri1 Ra1ma soon
<>treated him kindly.
<NI>Even the Devas who witnessed the scene were alarmed.
<>But Ra1ma sat there for sometime immersed in medi-
<>tation and then a light emerged from his right eye,
<>shot towards the north and disappeared in the horizon.
<>At once Garud2a appeared on the scene from the west
<>and removed with his beak the na1ga1stra from
<>Laks2man2a's body. Laks2man2a jumped up from his
<>unconscious state; Sugri1va and others also regained
<>consciousness. In the fighting that followed all the
<>Ra1ks2asa leaders were killed. It was Hanu1ma1n, who
<>killed Kumbhakarn2a. At the time of his death
<>Kumbhakarn2a made a last request to Ra1ma, i. e. his head
<>should be cut off and thrown into the sea as otherwise
<>the Ra1ks2asas would laught at him to see the head from
<>which the ears have been bitten off by monkeys.
<>Accordingly Ra1ma got Hanu1ma1n to throw Kumbha-
<>karn2a's head into the sea.
<NI>Then S4ri1 Ra1ma told Laks2man2a thus: Today I shall
<>fight Indrajit. The war shall not continue yet further.
<>Today Indrajit and tomorrow Ra1van2a should be killed
<>and the next day we will return to Ayodhya1. Laks2man2a
<>answered:--“I shall fight Indrajit. I have told Vibhi1s2an2a
<>that I will kill Indrajit within three days.”
<NI>With S4ri1 Ra1ma's blessings Laks2man2a began fighting
<>again. Indrajit shot Na1ra1yan2a1stra which attracted by
<>the ‘seven-letter-Mantra’ (Namo Na1ra1yan2a1ya) of
<>Laks2man2a circled him thrice and entered his quiver.
<>The Ra1ks2asa minister called Mahodara converted his
<>elephant into Aira1vata and himself changed into
<>Devendra and encountered Laks2man2a. Saying that he
<>had no quarrel with Indra and would not fight him
<>Laks2man2a put down his bow, and Indrajit, exploiting
<>the situation shot Brahma1stra against Laks2man2a under
<>cover of the clouds. Laks2man2a, Sugri1va and others
<>fainted. Then S4ri1 Ra1ma was in the army-camp,
<>worshipping weapons to render them more powerful.
<>Ra1ma returned to the battle-ground to find Laks2man2a
<>and others in life-less condition and crying like a mere
<>ignorant fellow he lay by the side of Laks2man2a.
<>Vibhi1s2an2a, who returned with food prayed for the grace
<>of Devas. Indra appeared, gave to Vibhi1s2an2a Gan3ga1
<>water in a golden vessel and asked it to be given to
<>Hanu1ma1n and Ja1mbava1n, who, though unconscious
<>were not dead.
<NI>Vibhi1s2an2a did so and both Hanu1ma1n and Ja1mbava1n
<>regained consciousness. Ja1mbava1n told Hanu1ma1n that
<>if mr2tasan5ji1vini1 (herbal medicine which will put life
<>back into the dead) were brought from the distant
<>Hima1layas before dawn the next day all the dead ones
<>like Laks2man2a and Sugri1va could be brought back to
<>life. (See under Mr2tasan5ji1vini1). Accordingly Hanu1ma1n
<>started for the Hima1layas. Meanwhile Indrajit had [Page638-b+ 64]
<>told Ra1van2a about his victory, and as suggested by the
<>latter Ra1ks2asa women took Si1ta1 to the battlefield in the
<>Pus2paka Vima1na, showed her Ra1ma, Laks2man2a and
<>others lying there in a life-less condition and told her
<>that all of them were dead. Si1ta1 wept aloud, but Trijat2a1
<>consoled her by saying that the Pus2paka Vima1na would
<>not carry widows and therefore Ra1ma was not dead.
<NI>Hanu1ma1n returned before dawn the next day. As he
<>could not distinguish mr2tasan5ji1vini1 he had brought
<>with him a mountain peak where the four medicinal
<>plants, S4alyaharan2i1, Vis4alyakaran2i1, Sandha1nakaran2i1
<>and Mr2tasan5ji1vini1 grew. Ja1mbava1n distinguished
<>mr2tasan5ji1vini1 from the others and carried the four
<>herbs into the battlefield. Contact with the air, which
<>carried the smell of mr2tasan5ji1vini1 brought the dead back
<>to life. Vis4alyakaran2i1 removed all the arrows from their
<>bodies and Sandha1nakaran2i1 healed the wounds.
<NI>Laks2man2a again went out to fight Indrajit. Reluctant
<>to fight with the former, Indrajit resorted to a new
<>magical trick. He created an artificial or illusory
<>Si1ta1 and with her seated in a chariot he rose up in the
<>sky and said as follows: “Ra1van2a has abandoned Si1ta1
<>who brings about humiliation to the Ra1ks2asas and
<>ruin to Lan3ka1. So, I cut her to pieces.” So saying he
<>cut into two, by one stroke of his sword, Si1ta1, who
<>cried Oh! my lord! oh! brother.” Blood fell on the
<>battlefield and Indrajit disappeared. Though Ra1ma
<>and others were alarmed by all these, Vibhi1s2an2a explain-
<>ed that it was all the magic of the Ra1ks2asas, and in the
<>fierce fighting that followed Laks2man2a killed Indrajit.
<>By now all the important and prominent Ra1ks2asas
<>were killed. At last Ra1van2a himself entered the battle-
<>field. His first encounter was with Laks2man2a. Then
<>the fighting turned into one between Ra1ma and
<>Ra1van2a. The former broke the bow of Ra1van2a and did
<>not want to fight with the weaponless Ra1ks2asa King.
<>Next day Ra1van2a brought Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a and
<>Kumbhodara to Lan3ka1. Both of them entered Ra1ma's
<>camp during night, but Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a, who realised
<>that nothing could be achieved there returned to
<>Pa1ta1la with Kumbhodara. He built a tunnel from
<>Pa1ta1la upwards to earth, where in the fort created by
<>Hanu1ma1n's tail twisted in a circle lay S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>others. The tunnel opened into this ‘fort’, and Pa1ta1la
<>Ra1van2a and his brother made Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>unconscious by making them inhale sammohana
<>medicine and carried them off into Pa1ta1la. Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a were laid in the court-yard of a Ka1li1 temple
<>to be sacrificed to Maha1ka1li1 the very same night.
<>Arrangements for the sacrifice were completed.
<NI>Hanu1ma1n had been frequently looking inside the fort.
<>As soon as the absence of Ra1ma and Laks2man2a was
<>noticed, Sugri1va and others, under the leadership of
<>Vibhi1s2an2a reached the Ka1li1 temple through the tunnel.
<>In the fighting that followed Hanu1ma1n killed Pa1ta1la
<>Ra1van2a and An3gada killed Mahodara. The only son
<>of Pa1ta1la Ra1van2a, Suma1li1, was crowned King of Pa1ta1la.
<>Ra1van2a entered the field again against Ra1ma. Ra1ma
<>shot the Mahendra arrow against Ra1van2a. The arrow,
<>which represented in itself the effulgence of Mahendra,
<>the hardness of diamonds, the intensity of fire and
<>Vis2n2u's glow cut off the ten heads of Ra1van2a. His
<>physical body fell on earth and his spirit ascended to

<>the turn of events, crowned Vibhi1s2an2a King of Lan3ka1.
<>Trijat2a1 was put in charge of dressing Si1ta1 in new
<>clothes. Apsara1s appeared on the scene. S4aci1devi1
<>presented to Si1ta1 a chain, Urvas4i1 an ornament for
<>the head, Menaka1, two bangles, Rambha1 a waist-let,
<>Tilottama1 a set of chains for the feet, and Anasu1ya1, wife
<>of Atri, a Cu1d2a1man2i. When she wore all these orna-
<>ments Si1ta1 appeared to be equal to Laks2mi1devi1 in
<>grandeur and charm. She was brought in a palanquin
<>to S4ri1 Ra1ma by Vibhi1s2an2a and others. Ra1ma was taken
<>aback by the glamorous dress, ornaments etc. of S4i1ta1,
<>and immediately a suspicion arose in his mind, and he
<>kept mum after asking Laks2man2a to do whatever Si1ta1
<>wanted. As soon as she heard those words of Ra1ma,
<>Si1ta1 asked Laks2man2a to light a funeral pyre saying that
<>the woman suspected by her husband should not live
<>and so she (Si1ta1) would quit her life in the very
<>presence of Ra1ma.
<NI>Laks2man2a cast a pathetic look at Ra1ma; but his face
<>exhibited no change of feeling. He granted Si1ta1's re-
<>quest by his silence. Those present there awaited develop-
<>ments with bated breath. Laks2man2a, with the help
<>of the monkeys got a pyre ready. After going round
<>Ra1ma with folded hands Si1ta1 leapt into the glowing fire.
<>Within a very short time three divine forms emerged
<>from the fire, Sva1ha1devi1, Si1ta1devi1 and God Agni.
<NI>His suspicions having thus vanished Ra1ma welcomed
<>Si1ta1 back and the next day they left for Ayodhya1 in the
<>Pus2paka Vima1na. Vibhi1s2an2a, Sugri1va, Hanu1ma1n and
<>others followed them. After reaching Ayodhya1 Ra1ma
<>returned the Pus2paka to Kubera. Bharata came back
<>from Nandigra1ma. In the presence of all relations
<>and others concerned the coronation of Ra1ma as king
<>took place. Bharata was appointed crown Prince, Laks2-
<>man2a Commander-in-chief of armies and S4atrughna,
<>Finance minister.
<NI>31) {%Si1ta1 abandoned.%} Under Ra1ma's rule the country
<>overflowed with milk and honey. Nobody had to fear
<>anything from enemies. He made Si1ta1 kill Sahasramukha
<>Ra1van2a. (For details see under Sahasramukhara1van2a).
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma used to go about the country in disguise to
<>enquire about the welfare of his subjects. On a particular
<>dawn he happened to be standing outside the house of
<>a washerman. The washerman scolded his wife, who
<>had gone out of the house that night for something.
<>He suspected that she had gone to meet her paramour.
<>He bluntly told his wife that he was not prepared to
<>act like Ra1ma, who had accepted Si1ta1, though she had
<>lived with another person. S4ri1 Ra1ma, who heard the
<>above talk, returned to his palace very sad. After
<>thinking about for a long time he decided that it was
<>his duty to abandon Si1ta1 in the interests of his subjects.
<>Then Si1ta1 was in the seventh month of her pregnancy. She
<>had on the previous day, expressed a desire to go to the
<>forest areas once again. Ra1ma considered this as the
<>most suitable opportunity to abandon Si1ta1 in the forest
<>and Laks2man2a was entrusted with the matter. That
<>day at Sun-rise Laks2man2a took Si1ta1 in a chariot to the
<>suburbs of Va1lmi1ki's a1s4rama, abandoned her there and
<>returned to the palace. (According to the Ra1ma1yan2a
<>written by Kamba, a Tamil author, it is said that Si1ta1
<>was left in the suburbs of Gautama's hut. There, Si1ta1
<>who was pregnant was looked after by Ahalya1, the wife
<>of Gautama.) Weeping aloud Si1ta1 fell down. Young [Page639-b+ 65]
<>munis--Va1lmi1ki's disciples--saw her and took her to
<>the a1s4rama. At the a1s4rama she delivered two sons, Kus4a
<>and Lava.
<NI>32) {%As4vamedha.%} After abandoning Si1ta1 in the forests
<>Ra1ma led a sad life for five years. Yet, he decided to
<>perform an As4vamedha yajn5a. As soon as Ra1ma thought
<>of him, Hanu1ma1n appeared and he was deputed to in-
<>vite Vibhi1s2an2a, Sugri1va and others from Lan3ka1 and
<>Kis2kindha1 and the feudatory princes and armies from
<>other countries.
<NI>Sugri1va was put in charge of the armies, Vibhi1s2an2a in
<>charge of finance, and central authority was vested in
<>Laks2man2a. Then the ya1jn5ic horse, accompanied
<>by the army, was let loose to travel all over the
<>country. Accompanied by cavalry, the elephant division,
<>infantry and the chariot-force the horse went about the
<>various kingdoms. The army, on its way back to Ayodhya1
<>with presents collected from many kingdoms, encamped
<>for rest near Va1lmi1ki's a1s4rama when Kus4a and Lava
<>tied the ya1jn5ic horse, which was strolling there unfetter-
<>ed. Consequent upon this action of Kus4a and Lava a fight
<>broke out between them and the king's army in which
<>the latter got defeated. Even the arrows of Laks2man2a
<>failed to have any effect on the boys. The boys having
<>not returned even though it had become very late in
<>the evening, the a1s4ramites went in search of them and
<>it was only when they came to the scene of fighting did
<>Laks2man2a and others know who the boys really were.
<NI>During this period of time infants' death was very much
<>on the increase in Ayodhya1. It was believed that such
<>deaths increased when S4u1dras did tapas, and to find out
<>if any S4u1dra was engaged in tapas Ra1ma flew over the
<>Dan2d2aka forest where he found a S4u1dra called S4ambu1ka
<>performing tapas hanging down from the branch of a
<>tree with his head down. Ra1ma killed him and his
<>spirit got salvation. Afterwards, appreciating the beauties
<>of the forest Ra1ma came near Va1lmi1ki's a1s4rama where
<>he and Si1ta1 met face to face. Kus4a and Lava also came
<>there and they noticed with surprise the change in
<>appearance brought about in their mother and Ra1ma
<>on their meeting each other. When they heard from
<>Hanu1ma1n the real facts about Ra1ma they withdrew
<>their arrows and prostrated at the feet of Ra1ma.
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma then, with the consent of all and in accord-
<>ance with his own desire, took back Si1ta1 and returned
<>with her to Ayodhya1. Laks2man2a and others followed him.
<>Kausalya1 and others received Si1ta1 most heartily. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma, who till then was having no wife, had made
<>a golden image of Si1ta1 for the purposes of the a va-
<>medha. Now, since the real Si1ta1 was with him the idol
<>was an unnecessary thing. The As4vamedhayajn5a went
<>off very well.
<NI>33) {%The end.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma's reign became all the more
<>prosperous. It was during this period that Ra1ma, as
<>desired by the munis in the Yamuna1 plain, killed
<>Lavan2a1sura, son of Madhu in the great city called
<>Durga in the centre of the Madhu forest. (For details
<>see under Lavan2a). After Lavan2a's death, a sect of
<>Gandharvas called S4ailu1s2as, who lived on the shores
<>of the eastern sea, proved to be enemies of Ayodhya1.
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma annihilated them also. Kaikeyi1 began getting
<>jealous of the prosperity and happiness of Si1ta1. One
<>day when Ra1ma had gone to hunt in the forest, Kaikeyi1
<>closely questioned Si1ta1 over particulars in Lan3ka1 and
<>prevailed upon her, overruling her unwillingness, to [Page640-a+ 63]
<>draw a picture of Ra1van2a. Si1ta1 drew on a piece of
<>‘sitting-plank’ Ra1van2a's figure with the ten heads.
<>Kaikeyi1 took away the picture on the pretext of exhi-
<>biting it in the ladies' quarters, and gave it to Ra1ma,
<>when he returned from hunting, to sit on at the time
<>of Pu1ja1 (worship). Ra1ma got angry to find Ra1van2a's
<>picture drawn on the ‘sitting plank’. Kaikeyi1 then told
<>him that it was Si1ta1, who had drawn the picture and
<>also that she usually praised Lan3ka1 and Ra1van2a. Ra1ma
<>pronounced the death penalty on Si1ta1 for having drawn
<>Ra1van2a's picture. The inmates of the palace
<>shuddered to hear the judgement. When Laks2man2a
<>seated Si1ta1 on the floor to kill her, Bhu1midevi1 (earth)
<>rent itself open into two and carried her off through the
<>opening.
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma grew sadder and sadder following the dis-
<>appearance of Si1ta1. Ill omens began to appear in
<>Ayodhya1 in increasing measure. One day a divine R2s2i
<>whom the people of Ayodhya1 had not seen till then,
<>came to Ra1ma's palace. He told Ra1ma that he had to
<>impart certain secrets to the latter and after making
<>Ra1ma vow that no one would enter the room while
<>they were conversing and that if any one did come
<>when they were talking, he should either be killed or
<>forsaken for ever, he began to talk with Ra1ma in a
<>secluded spot. Ra1ma posted Laks2man2a at the entrance
<>with the strict injunctions that nobody should come
<>into their presence. Within a short time great munis
<>like Sanaka came there and told Laks2man2a that they
<>wanted to see Ra1ma. They were not prepared to wait
<>even for a short time as requested by Laks2man2a, but
<>threatened ruin to the royal family. Laks2man2a then,
<>was prepared to suffer the consequence, and went to
<>Ra1ma and told him about the arrival of Sanaka and
<>others. Ra1ma, in keeping with his vow, banished
<>Laks2man2a immediately. But, when Ra1ma came out and
<>looked for Sanaka and others no one was to be found
<>anywhere there. When he returned to the inner apart-
<>ment the R2s2i also was not to be seen. In fact they were
<>Ka1la and his emissaries deputed by Brahma1 to recall
<>Ra1ma as the object of his incarnation was already
<>achieved.
<NI>Ra1ma, who had already been suffering mental agony
<>on account of Si1ta1's departure, lost all peace of mind
<>as Laks2man2a's banishment followed Si1ta1's departure.
<>He decided to put an end to his life for which purpose
<>he went to the river Sarayu1. All the dependants followed
<>him. While the great mass of people who thronged
<>both the banks of the river burst out into weeping S4ri1
<>Ra1ma and his followers drowned themselves in the
<>waters of the Sarayu1, and their spirits attained Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a and

<NI>1) {%General.%} Ra1ma1yan2a is considered to be the first
<>poetic composition in the world or at least in India,
<>and hence it is called the A1di Ka1vya (First Epic). It
<>is an epic as it contains descriptions and references to
<>ancient themes. Va1lmi1ki is its author, and hence
<>Va1lmi1ki is known as the ‘A1di kavi” also. Va1lmi1ki and
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma were contemporaries. During his life in exile
<>in the forest Ra1ma visited Va1lmi1ki1's a1s4rama. It was
<>in this a1s4rama that Si1ta1 lived after being abandoned
<>by Ra1ma. The connection in many ways of the life of
<>Va1lmi1ki with the ‘Ra1ma story’ was an incentive for
<>him to write the Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>2) {%Composing of Ra1ma1yan2a.%} Once while returning from
<>the river Tamasa1 Va1lmi1ki witnessed a hunter shooting
<>down one of a Kraun5ca (a kind of bird) couple. The
<>intense emotion created by the incident burst out as
<>follows in verse form.
<Poem>Ma1 nis2a1da pratis2t2ha1m3 tvamagamah2
<>s4a1s4vati1h2 sama1h2 /
<>Yat kraun5camithuna1dekamavadhi1h2
<>ka1mamohitam. //</Poem>
<NI>Immediately Brahma1 appeared on the scene and
<>advised Va1lmi1ki to write the story of Ra1ma in the
<>same pattern as that verse. Brahma1 taught him about
<>the past and the future of the history of Ra1ma. As
<>Si1ta1, Kus4a, and Lava were living in his a1s4rama Va1lmi1ki
<>was well in the know about the present. In the above [Page641-a+ 64]
<>background Va1lmi1ki completed writing the Ra1ma1yan2a
<>Story in 24,000 verses. The epic is divided into seven
<>ka1n2d2as (sections) of five hundred chapters. The seven
<>sections are the Ba1laka1n2d2a, the Ayodhya1ka1n2d2a, the
<>Aran2ya ka1n2d2a, the Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, the Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a, the Yuddha Ka1n2d2a and the Uttaraka1n2d2a.
<NI>Va1lmi1ki taught the poem to Lava and Kus4a and when
<>they went with Va1lmi1ki to Ayodhya1 during the
<>as4vamedhayajn5a of S4ri1 Ra1ma, they sang the poem in
<>the open assembly there.
<NI>3) {%Different views about the author.%} Tradition ascribes
<>the authorship of the Ra1ma1yan2a to Va1lmi1ki. But,
<>western scholars hold the view that a part of Ba1laka1n2d2a
<>and the whole of Uttaraka1n2d2a are interpolations of a
<>future date. The following are the reasons for this view.
<NI>(i) Two different texts are found for cantos one and
<>three of Ba1laka1n2d2a. In one of them many of the stories
<>mentioned in the other are missing. It may, therefore,
<>be surmised that the two texts were composed during
<>different periods.
<NI>(ii) In the early texts of Ra1ma1yan2a stories like Gan3ga1-
<>vataran2am are not to be found. So they must be inter-
<>polations of a later period.
<NI>(iii) Only in Ka1n2d2as one and seven is S4ri1 Ra1ma treated
<>as an incarnation. In the other Ka1n2d2as he is considered
<>in the capacity of a hero only.
<NI>(iv) Uttaraka1n2d2a is not to be found among the early
<>translations of Ra1ma1yan2a into other languages.
<NI>(v) In the Ba1laka1n2d2a it is stated that Va1lmi1ki com-
<>posed the Ra1ma1yan2a, taught it to Kus4a and Lava, and
<>that they recited the whole poem before S4ri1 Ra1ma at
<>Ayodhya1. Many of the things mentioned in this Ka1n2d2a
<>are repeated in Uttaraka1n2d2a, which, therefore, must
<>have been written by someone else.
<NI>4) {%The period of Ra1ma1yan2a.%} According to Indian belief
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma lived at the end of Treta1yuga, which came to
<>its close in 8,67,100 B.C. As per Ra1ma1yan2a S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>ruled the country for 11,000 years. He was forty years
<>old when he ascended the throne. Va1lmi1ki began
<>writing the Ra1ma1yan2a after Lavakus4as were born.
<>In the light of the above facts. certain scholars opine
<>that the Ra1ma1yan2a was written near about 878000
<>B.C. But, western critics and some eastern critics do
<>not accept this view. Professor Jacobi holds the view
<>that the original of Maha1bha1rata is anterior to
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. Most scholars do not agree with this view.
<>A great majority of critics are of opinion that Ra1ma1yan2a
<>is anterior to Maha1bha1rata. They argue as follows:--
<NI>(i) The traditional belief in India is that Ra1ma1yan2a
<>was written much earlier than Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>(ii) Ra1ma1yan2a makes no reference to any of the
<>characters of Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>(iii) The S4ri1 Ra1ma story is referred to in many a
<>Ja1taka story of the Buddhists.
<NI>(iv) Va1lmi1ki has made no mention about the city of
<>Pa1t2ali1putra established near about 380 B.C. It is an
<>irrefutable fact that S4ri1 Ra1ma had passed by the city.
<NI>(v) During the reign of emperor As4oka the Pra1kr2ta lan-
<>guage was spoken in the areas where the incidents men-
<>tioned in Ra1ma1yan2a took place. But, Ra1ma1yan2a was
<>written much anterior to the emergence of Pra1kr2ta
<>language.
<NI>According to Professor Keith Ra1ma1yan2a was written in
<>300 B.C. [Page641-b+ 65]
<NI>5). {%Different readings of Ra1ma1yan2a.%} In various parts of
<>India three original texts or readings are found of the
<>original Ra1ma1yan2a. In each of the three texts nearly
<>(1/3) of the portions differ from one another. The Bombay
<>text is popular in northern and southern India. The
<>second is the Bengal text. The third, the Kashmir text,
<>is popular in the north-western parts of India. The in-
<>ference to be made from the existence of these three
<>different texts is that the original epic was composed in
<>a Pra1kr2ta language, which was most popular at the time
<>and that it was later translated into Sanskrit by differ-
<>ent persons at different times. This theory will
<>explain the existence of the different texts. For many
<>years it continued to be handed down from mouth to
<>month till it assumed written form in Sanskrit.
<NI>6). {%Other Ra1ma1yan2as.%} The Ra1ma1yan2a story in other
<>forms and garbs, is also prevalent in India. One of
<>them is Va1sis2t2hara1ma1yan2a or Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha. The
<>authorship of it also is ascribed to Va1lmi1ki. Most of
<>the Ra1ma1yan2as like Va1sis2t2hottarara1ma1yan2a, Si1ta1vijaya,
<>Adbhutara1ma1yan2a, Adbhutottarara1ma1yan2a etc. found
<>in different parts of India are believed to have been
<>written by Va1lmi1ki. Adbhutara1ma1yan2a is composd of
<>twentyseven cantos. According to this Ra1ma1yan2a, it
<>was Si1ta1, who killed Ra1van2a of ten heads. There is an-
<>other Ra1ma1yan2a in Sanskrit called Adhya1tma-Ra1ma1yan2a.
<>It is a poem separated from Brahma1n2d2apura1n2a. It is
<>written in the form of a conversation between Uma1
<>(Pa1rvati1) and S4iva. A1nanda-Ra1ma1yan2a and Mu1la-
<>Ra1ma1yan2a extol the greatness of Hanu1ma1n.
<HI>RAMBHA. An asura. (For details see under Karambha).

<NI>1) {%General.%} One of the most beautiful of the apsara1
<>women. Urvas4i1, Tilottama1 and Rambha1 are really
<>reputed for their beauty.

<>of Kas4yapapraja1pati by his wife Pradha1. Devars2i

<NI>3) {%Ra1van2a cursed.%} Ra1van2a raped Rambha1 and Nala-
<>ku1bara cursed him. (See under Nalaku1bara)
<NI>4) {%Puru1ravas and Rambha1.%} Indra once killed an asura
<>chief named Ma1ya1dhara and held a festival in honour
<>of the victory. At the festival Rambha1 danced before
<>her preceptor Tumburu. Puru1ravas too was present on
<>the occasion and he ridiculed Rambha1 for her mistakes
<>in dancing. Moreover he claimed that he was a greater
<>master of dance than Tumburu preceptor of Rambha1.
<>Enraged by this claim Tumburu cursed that Puru1ravas
<>would be separated from his wife Urvas4i1. (Katha1sarit-
<>sa1gara, La1va1n2akalambaka, Taran3ga 3).
<NI>5) {%Rambha1 and Sus2en2a.%} There was a King called Sus2en2a
<>on mount Citraku1t2a. This handsome bachelor prince
<>used to sit alone in the lotus pond near his palace. When
<>once Rambha1 passed through the sky above the pond
<>her eyes met those of Sus2en2a and she alighted on the
<>spot and the long talk between the two ended in their
<>marriage. Sus2en2a enjoyed life there for a long time with
<>Rambha1 without knowing that she was an apsara1
<>woman. He had attempted many a time to know the
<>real facts about her, to no purpose. Rambha1 did
<>not even think about her native Svarga. Her com-
<>panion, a Yaks2i1, showered gold all over Sus2en2a's [Page642-a+ 65]
<>kingdom. In due course Rambha1 delivered a beautiful
<>female child and then she told the King that she was
<>Rambha1 and that she had continued as his wife till
<>then as she felt love towards him. She further told him
<>that now she had begot a daughter, she was leaving
<>him and that she had a curse upon her which had been
<>redeemed now. She also assured him that they would
<>meet in Svarga in case the daughter was duly wedded.
<>Rambha1 departed to Svarga. Sus2en2a named the
<>child Sulocana1 and when she came of age he married
<>her to Vatsamahars2i and then went to Devaloka where
<>he lived happily with Rambha1 for a long time. (Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara, Madanaman5cuka1lambaka, Taran3ga 2).
<NI>6) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) The powerful asura called Catura1sya once felt a
<>great yearning for Rambha1 and her maid Svayam-
<>prabha1 managed things for him. He built a garden-city
<>and presented it to Svayamprabha1 in return for her
<>service stated above. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(ii) The Sage Gautama alias S4aradva1n experienced

<>semen was born Kr2pi1 whom in due course of time
<>Dron2a1ca1rya married. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5-

<NI>(iii) Indra once deputed Rambha1 to break the vigorous
<>tapas Vis4va1mitra was observing. She approached him
<>in the guise of a nightingale and with her song dis-
<>turbed his meditation. The muni cursed her as follows
<>and turned her into a rock. “Oh! evil woman Rambha1,
<>you have cheated me, who have mastered desire and
<>anger and so you be turned into a rock for a thousand
<>years. The great brahmin ascetic, Bhu1ritejas will ab-
<>solve you from my curse and you will then resume your
<>own form.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 64).
<NI>(iv) Rambha1 gave a dance performance on the occa-
<>sion of the birthday celebrations of Arjuna. (A1di Parva,

<HI>RA1MES4VARA. There is in South India a very famous
<>holy place called Ra1mes4vara and a S4iva temple there.
<>Ra1ma and others encamped on the sea shore to cross
<>over to Lan3ka1 to release Si1ta1 from Ra1van2a's custody.
<>This temple, according to Kamba, was built by Ra1ma at
<>that time. The following story is from the Yuddha Ka1n2d2a
<>of Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>To make the passage over to Lan3ka1 easy, Ra1ma decided to
<>build a great temple at Ra1mes4vara and install a S4ivalin3ga
<>in the temple. Under the expert supervision of the great
<>architects, Nala and Ni1la, all the monkeys cooperated to
<>build the temple. As ordered by Ra1ma, Hanu1ma1n went to
<>Kaila1sa to fetch S4ivalin3ga. Hanu1ma1n did not return
<>with the lin3ga though the auspicious time for the ins-
<>tallation was very near. How could the installation be [Page642-b+ 65]
<>made without the idol and the installation had to be
<>made at the appointed time.
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma stood ready near the installation platform.
<>It was the exact time for the installation of the idol.
<>A divine effulgence was seen to emerge from Ra1ma and
<>immediately a S4ivalin3ga automatically appeared at the
<>spot where rituals were conducted for installation.
<>Everyone was wonder-struck by this mysterious hap-
<>pening.
<NI>Hanu1ma1n by now, returned with the lin3ga and he felt
<>sorry that the installation of the idol had already been
<>made. S4ri1 Ra1ma told him: “Please remove the idol
<>already installed, we shall install a new one.”
<NI>Happy at the words of Ra1ma, Hanu1ma1n entwined the
<>idol with his tail and jumped directly upwards. But,
<>his tail was cut, head clashed against the roof which
<>was broken and Hanu1ma1n fell down unconscious. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma held him up and patted him on the head and
<>Hanu1ma1n was more pleased than ever. Afterwards, to
<>fulfil Hanu1ma1n's desire and for the prosperity of the
<>temple Hanu1ma1n was made to install the new
<>S4ivalin3ga in front of the eastern tower of the temple.
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma laid down the following rule also. Only after
<>worshipping the idol at the tower, should the God in-
<>side the temple be worshipped.
<NI>The rule was also recorded there.

<HI>RATI I. Wife of Ka1madeva and some Pura1n2as hold
<>the view that Ka1ma was the son of Dharma whose
<>father was Brahma1. But, the story of Ka1ma and Rati
<>is described in the Ka1lika1pura1n2a as follows.
<NI>Brahma1 created ten praja1patis. A beautiful lady
<>called Sandhya1 was his next creation. As soon as she was
<>born, seeing her exquisite beauty Brahma1 and the praja1-
<>patis jumped to their feet. All of them thought in the
<>same way. While the court of Brahma1 was in such a
<>perplexed confusion, an extremly handsome person
<>emerged from his mind. Fish was the symbol on his
<>flag, and he aked Brahma1 thus: “Oh father, what
<>should I do? Give me a suitable name and you should
<>also decide upon a place and position and also a wife
<>for me.” Brahma1 told him as follows:--“You be moving
<>about everywhere in this world (full of men and-
<>women) engaged in the eternal function of creation with
<>the five arrows of flower in your hands and thus multiply
<>the population. Your arrows will go everywhere and no
<>one, not even the Devas will dare to obstruct your
<>arrows. Everyone will yield to your behests. Vis2n2u, S4iva
<>and I also will yield before your arrows. You will enter
<>the hearts of living beings in invisible form and giving
<>them happiness engage yourself in eternal creation. The
<>chief aim and object of your arrows of flower will be the
<>hearts of living beings. You will be given a suitable
<>name just now.”
<NI>The praja1patis, who understood the wish of Brahma1,
<>after mutual consultation said: “You emerged churning
<>our minds. Therefore, you will become famous under
<>the name Manmatha (he who churns the mind). You
<>will lay low S4iva's haughtiness and conceit. Oh! best
<>among men, Daks2a, chief among the praja1patis, will
<>give you a wife.”
<NI>Happily pleased at the above words of Brahma1 Ka1ma
<>held up in his hands the bow and arrows of flowers
<>and decided to shoot five arrows, i.e. hars2an2am (pleas-
<>ing or gladdening), Rocanam (attracting or tempting),
<>mohanam (deluding or infatuating), s4os2an2am (weaken-
<>ing) and ma1ran2am (killing). He decided to use the
<>arrows first against Brahma1 and then against the praja1-
<>patis. Accordingly the arrows shot forth and Brahma1
<>and all the praja1patis overwhelmed by sexual passion
<>stared at Sandhya1devi1. Sandhya1 also got excited and
<>from her body sprouted up 49 parts; 64 kala1s (arts)
<>also were born from her. She used incessantly against
<>the leaders of the world (Brahma1 and others) who
<>were downed by the arrows of sexual passion, arrows
<>dear to Manmatha. The expressions of Brahma1 made
<>Sandhya1 sick with love.
<NI>S4iva, who was just then travelling along the sky, seeing
<>the boisterous exhibitions of passion by Brahma1 and
<>others alighted there. He ridiculed Brahma1 for his dis-
<>play of passion towards his own daughter Sandhya1 and
<>spoke further like this: “This Ka1ma too is a fool. He
<>tested his arrows here itself, he has no sense of propriety
<>and discretion.”
<NI>Brahma1 was thoroughly ashamed at the words of S4iva.
<>He perspired and swept with his hands the drops of
<>sweat that oozed from his body. With great difficulty he
<>controlled his passion and gave up Sandhya1. From [Page645-a+ 63]
<>the drops of sweat falling on the ground from the body
<>of Brahma1 were born the pitr2s called Agnis2va1ttas and
<>the Barhis2adas, the former 64,000 in number and the
<>latter 4,80,000. Drops of sweat from the bodies of the
<>praja1patis also fell on the ground and from them were
<>born the Devas. The pitr2s called Somapa1s are the sons
<>of Kratu; those called Svaka1likas are the sons of
<>Vasis2t2ha; sons of Pulastya are called A1jyapa1s and
<>Havirbhuks are the sons of An3giras.
<NI>Brahma1, who was angry that Ka1ma shot his arrows
<>against him in the presence of S4iva cursed the former
<>that he would be burnt to ashes in the fire of S4iva's
<>eyes, and Ka1ma trembling with fear at the curse pros-
<>trated at the feet of Brahma1 and wept Then Brahma1
<>said that though he would die in the fire of S4iva's eyes,
<>he would be born again.
<NI>From the drops of perspiration that fell on the ground
<>from Daks2a's body arose a beautiful woman, and Daks2a
<>told Ka1ma that the woman, his daughter would
<>become famous as Rati devi1. Daks2a gave Rati Devi1
<>to Ka1ma to be his wife. Thus did Rati become
<>Ka1ma's wife. (For the second birth of Rati see under
<>Pradyumna and for other details see under Ka1ma.)

<NI>4) {%Ra1van2a secured boons.%} Kaikasi1 (Ra1van2a's mother)
<>who became envious of the pomp and prowess of Kubera
<>advised her son to secure boons from Brahma1 by tapas
<>and become equal to Kubera. Accordingly he went to
<>Gokarn2a with his brothers and began tapas. Kumbha-
<>karn2a did tapas for 10,000 years; Vibhi1s2an2a also did
<>tapas for 10,000 years standing on one foot. Ra1van2a,
<>standing in the middle of the five fires, meditated upon
<>Brahma1. Though 10,000 years passed thus, Brahma1 did
<>not appear yet. Ra1van2a then cut one of his ten heads
<>and made an offering of it to Brahma1 in the fire. Thus,
<>within 9000 years he cut nine of his heads and offered
<>them to Brahma1 in the fire. Lastly when he was about
<>to cut off his tenth head, Brahma1 appeared and asked
<>him to choose whatever boon he wanted. Ra1van2a
<>chose the boon that from none but men should he
<>meet with his death. Kumbhakarn2a desired to secure
<>the boon of ‘nirdevatva’ (Absence of the devas) but
<>secured by a slip of the tongue ‘nidra1vatvam’ (sleep).
<>Vibhi1s2an2a chose devotion to Vis2n2u. On his return
<>after securing the boons, Ra1van2a occupied Lan3ka1,
<>drove away Kubera and took his pus2paka chariot.
<>Ra1van2a further declared Maha1vis2n2u to be his eternal

<>mountain. Then the King called Marutta was per-
<>forming Mahes4vara yajn5a on the plains of the moun-
<>tain. Indra and the other devas came to receive their
<>portion of the offerings. But they ran away in fear on

<>ra1ma.
<NI>2) {%R2ci1ka's marriage.%} Ga1dhi, a king of the Lunar dynasty
<>had a daughter, Satyavati1. R2ci1ka wished to marry this
<>beautiful princess. Ga1dhi agreed to give his daughter

<>black ears. R2ci1ka offered worship to Varun2a to help him
<>in the matter. Varun2a was pleased and a thousand
<>horses rose up from the river Gan3ga1. R2ci1ka married
<>Satyavati1 after giving the horses. Afterwards both of
<>them went and settled down in the forest.
<NI>3) {%Birth of Jamadagni.%} One day Satyavati1 made a request
<>to R2ci1ka that she should have a son. Besides, she request-
<>ed him that her mother should be blessed with a son,
<>so that she might have a brother. R2ci1ka performed a
<>“homa” and after that he made two balls of rice and
<>gave them to Satyavati1. He advised her to eat one of
<>them and to give the other to her mother. R2ci1ka had put
<>“Brahmatejas” (brilliance of Brahmins) in the first rice-
<>ball and “Ks2a1tratejas” (brilliance of Ks2atriyas) in the
<>other. When Satyavati1 and her mother ate the rice-
<>balls, it so happened that the rice-ball intended for her
<>mother was eaten by Satyavati1 and the one intended for
<>Satyavati1 was eaten by the mother. Later R2ci1ka came to
<>know of this mistake. In due course, Satyavati1 and her

<>cow. Since it was an evil omen, the priest advised Am-
<>bari1s2a that either the lost cow or a human being in its place
<>must be obtained to complete the ya1ga. In spite of sear-
<>ches made in many places, the cow could not be traced.
<>At last Ambari1s2a's men met R2ci1ka who was doing tapas
<>on Bhr2gutun3ga. R2ci1ka sold his second son, S4unas4s4epha
<>to Am3bari1s2a in exchange for the price of 100,000 cows. [Page648-a+ 63]
<>The king took S4unas4s4epha with him and came to Pus2kara
<>ti1rtha. There they happened to meet Vis4va1mitra.
<>S4unas4s4epha complained to Vis4va1mitra and lamented
<>over his ill-fate. Vis4va1mitra wished to save him and to
<>send one of his own sons in his place with Ambari1s2a.
<>But none of his sons was willing to oblige. Vis4va1mitra
<>cursed them and turned them into eaters of human
<>flesh. Then he turned to S4unas4s4epha and said:--
<NI>“When you stand ready to be sacrificed near the altar,
<>offer your prayers to Agni. If you do so, you will attain
<>siddhi.” (salvation or moks2a). He also taught him two
<>songs of praise to Agni.
<NI>While standing at the altar ready to be sacrificed
<>Sunas4 epha recited the two songs of praise. Indra and
<>the other gods appeared and after saving S4unas4s4epha
<>rewarded Ambari1s2a for his ya1ga. (Va1lmi1ki Rama1yan2a,

<>the Tripuras. That bow is known as “S4aivaca1pa”. The
<>other bow was given to Vis2n2u. It is called “Vais2n2ava-
<>ca1pa”. The Devas wished to see a trial of strength bet-
<>ween S4iva and Vis2n2u. They prompted Brahma1 to bring
<>about such a conflict. Brahma1 succeeded in causing a
<>quarrel between S4iva and Vis2n2u. A fight began between
<>S4iva and Vis2n2u. Both the S4aivaca1pa and Vais2n2avaca1pa
<>went into action. But S4iva was defeated. After that, Siva
<>gave his bow to Devara1ta, king of Videha. By inheritance
<>it came into the hands of king Janaka, the father of S4i1ta1.
<>It was this bow which was broken by S4ri1 Ra1ma at the
<>time of Si1ta1's Svayam3vara.
<NI>After the battle with S4iva, Vis2n2u gave his bow to
<>R2ci1ka who, in turn gave it to Jamadagni. Jamadagni

<>Brahma1 the beautful Revati1 was given in marriage to
<>Balabhadrara1ma. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10; Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<HI>REVATI1 II. In Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 230,
<>Stanza 29, the name ‘Revati1’ is used as a synonym of
<>Aditi Devi1. [Page649-a+ 64]
<HI>REVATI1 III. One of the twentyseven stars. The following
<>statements occur in the Maha1bha1rata about the import-
<>ance of this star.
<NI>(i) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a started on his journey at the auspicious
<>moment of Maitra on the star Revati1 in the month of
<>Ka1rttika. (M.B. Udyoga Parva. Chapter 83, Stanza 6).
<NI>(ii) If a cow is given as alms on the day of this star
<>that cow will go to heaven and make preparations for
<>the comforts and convenience of the giver. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 64, Stanza 33).
<NI>(iii) He who gives offerings to the manes on Revati1
<>day would become wealthy. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 89, Stanza 14).
<HI>REVATI1 IV. The mother of Raivata, the lord of the fifth
<>Manvantara (age of a Manu). There is a story in the
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a about the birth of Revati1.
<NI>A son was born to the hermit R2tava1k on Revati1 day.
<NI>By and by he became wicked. Having learned from
<>the hermit Garga that his son became wicked because
<>he was born under the star Revati1, R2tava1k cursed the
<>star Revati1 and kicked it down from its place. The spot
<>on which the star fell became a lake. After a time a
<>beautiful damsel was born from the lake. The hermit
<>Pramuca took the girl home and brought her up.
<>She was called Revati1. When she came of age, she was
<>given in marriage to Durgama, the son of king
<>Vikramas4i1la. At the request of Revati1 her marriage was
<>conducted at an auspicious moment on the day of the
<>star Revati1. The hermit blessed the couple “Let a son,
<>who would become the Lord of the Manvantara, be
<>born to you.” As a result of this blessing the bright and
<>valiant son Raivata was born to them. This Raivata
<>was the Lord of the fifth Manvantara.
<HI>R2GVEDA. The R2gveda is the oldest recorded work of
<>the human race. The Egyptians claim that another book
<>entitled “Book of the Dead” was also written during the
<>period of the R2gveda. The Babylonians have an ancient
<>work called ‘Gilgamish’, which according to scholars, is
<>not as old as the R2gveda. R2gveda is the work that forms
<>the basis of Hindu religion. Of the four Vedas, Yajur-
<>veda, Sa1maveda and Atharvaveda were composed
<>after R2gveda.” The R2gveda su1ktas were interpreted for
<>the first time in Ya1ska's “Nirukta” and Sa1yan2a's
<>“Veda1rthapraka1s4a”.
<NI>The most important of the four Vedas is R2gveda. It
<>is divided into ten “Man2d2alas”. There are 1017 su1ktas
<>and 10472 R2ks in it. Although there are 11 more
<>Su1ktas called “khilas,” they are not usually included in
<>the R2gveda.
<NI>Man2d2alas two to seven of the R2gveda were composed in
<>different R2s2ikulas. The second Man2d2ala was of
<>Bha1rgava Kula, the third of Vis4va1mitrakula, the fourth
<>of Va1madeva, the fifth of Atri, the sixth of Bharadva1ja
<>and the seventh of Vasis2t2ha. The eighth Man2d2ala and the
<>first 50 Su1ktas of the first Man2d2ala were composed by
<>Kan2vakula. The general view is that the tenth Man2d2ala
<>was written by someone at a later period.
<NI>Most of the R2gveda su1ktas are praises. But some of the
<>Su1ktas in the tenth Man2d2ala are of a different type.
<>We can see in many su1ktas the joy and wonder
<>experienced by the A1ryas when they entered the beauti-
<>ful land of India for the first time. Most scholars believe
<>that the R2gveda was composed during the period
<>between 2,500 and 2,000 B.C. [Page649-b+ 64]
<NI>{%Ancient Belief about R2gveda.%} The four Vedas--R2gveda,
<>Yajurveda, Sa1maveda and Atharvaveda emerged from
<>the four faces of Brahma1. In Kr2tayuga, Brahma1 gave
<>these Vedas to his sons. In Dva1parayuga, the R2s2is got
<>these Vedas. Maha1vis2n2u incarnated on earth for the
<>preservation of Dharma, in the person of Veda Vya1sa.
<>Vya1sa distributed the Vedas among his son S4a1kalya and
<>his disciples. S4a1kalya received R2gveda. He com-
<>municated it to his disciples. (Bha1gavata, 12th Skan-
<>dha. See under the word Veda).
<HI>RIPU. Grandson of Dhruva. Two sons called S4is2t2i and
<>Bhavya were born to Dhruva by his wife S4ambhu1.
<>S4is2t2i's wife Succha1ya1 deliverd five sons, i.e. Ripu,
<>Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2katejas. Ca1ks2us2a Manu
<>was born as the son of Ripu by his wife Br2hati1.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 13).
<HI>RIPUN5JAYA. I Son of Suratha, lord of Kun2d2ala city.
<>When Suratha captured S4ri1 Ra1ma's ya1jn5ic horse there
<>ensued a fierce war between him and S4atrughna.
<>Ripun5jaya too was present at the fighting. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>RIPUN5JAYA. II A brahmin, who was born as Divoda1sa,
<>king of Ka1s4i1 in his rebirth. When once fire ceased to
<>be in Ka1s4i1, he took upon himself the function of fire.
<>(Skanda pura1n2a, 4. 2, 39-48).

<HI>RIS2T2A. A king. He worships Yama in his assembly.
<>(Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8).
<HI>R2JIS4VA1. A king mentioned in the R2gveda. Once he
<>besieged the city of another King, Vam3gr2da, with the
<>help of Indra. (R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 10th Anuva1ka,
<>53rd Su1kta).
<HI>R2JRAS4VA. A muni (sage) celebrated in the R2gveda.
<>Some details. (1) R2jra1s4va was made blind by his father
<>(R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 16th Anuva1ka, 112th Su1kta)
<>(2) R2jra1s4va was the son of the royal sage, Vr2s2a1gi1r.
<>Once the donkey which is the vehicle of the As4vini1devas
<>assumed the shape of a she-wolf and went to R2jra1s4va.
<>R2jra1sva gave it 100 sheep belonging to the people of
<>the country and cut them to pieces and offered the same
<>as food to the she-wolf. This plunder of the people's
<>wealth enraged Vr2s2a1gi1r. He cursed R2jra1s4va and made
<>him lose his eye-sight.
<NI>R2jra1s4va who thus became blind offered prayers to
<>Agni, who restored his eyesight. (R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala,
<>17th Anuva1ka, 116th Su1kta).
<HI>R2K. A small section of the Veda. The Veda which issued
<>from the face of God at the time of creation, consisted
<>of 1,00,000 books in four sections, beginning with R2k.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part III, Chapter 4). The root “R2C”
<>means “to praise”. It got the name “R2K” meaning,
<>“to praise gods”.
<HI>R2KS2A I. A king of the Pu1ru dynasty. He was the father

<>red colour. [Page650-a+ 64]
<HI>R2KS2A1MBIKA1. A woman follower of Lord Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 12).
<HI>R2KS2ARAJAS. A monkey who was the foster-father of
<>Ba1li and Sugri1va. He was the king of Kis2kindha1. He
<>had no issue for a long time. Ba1li and Sugri1va were
<>brought up by Ahalya1 at Gautama's a1s4rama. R2ksarajas,
<>with the permission of Indra, went to the a1s4rama and
<>took Ba1li and Sugri1va with him to Kis2kindha1. From
<>that time, Ba1li and Sugri1va remained with him as his
<>foster-sons. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>There is a story in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Praks2ipta Sarga,
<>about the origin of this monkey.
<NI>Once when Brahma1 was in a state of meditation on the
<>Meru mountain, tears rolled down from his eyes and
<>he gathered the tears in his own hands. From those
<>tears, a monkey came into being. R2ks2arajas was that
<>monkey.
<NI>One day, R2ks2arajas went to a lake to quench his thirst.
<>Seeing his own image reflected in the water, he thought
<>it was some enemy and jumped into the lake, to
<>attack him. But he soon realized his mistake and
<>returned to the shore. As soon as he came out of the
<>water, he felt that he had become a woman. Seeing her
<>fascinating beauty, Indra and Su1rya were filled with
<>lustful passion. Both of them had involuntary emission
<>of semen. Ba1li was born from Indra's semen which
<>fell on the head and Sugri1va was born from Su1rya's
<>semen which fell on the neck of R2ks2arajas. Towards the
<>end of the night, R2ks2arajas lost his female form and re-
<>gained his former shape as a male. At once he took the
<>two children with him to Brahma1 and told him the
<>whole story. Brahma1 sent a messenger with R2ks2arajas
<>and had him anointed king of Kis2kindha1. After the
<>time of R2ks2arajas, Ba1li became king of Kis2kindha1.
<HI>R2KS2AS4R2N3GA. The younger son of Di1rghatapas who
<>was performing tapas in Manda1ravana on the northern
<>part of Ka1s4i1. Since he was killed by Citrasena, all
<>others committed suicide. But Di1rghatapas who was

<>did tapas in Pulaha's a1s4rama.
<NI>2) {%R2s2abha and R2s2abhaku1t2a%} R2s2abha did tapas in the
<>forest for many years. The mountain peak on which
<>he performed his tapas got the name “R2s2abhaku1t2a”.
<>The sage who wished to observe strict silence did not
<>like the presence of strangers and visitors in the vicinity.
<>So he pronounced a curse that the mountain should
<>drop boulders on any one who ventured to come there.
<>Once he ordered the wind to blow without noise as it
<>passed by the side of the mountain. He declared that

<>King Vajraba1hu (Am3s4uma1n). Sumati became pregnant.
<>Her co-wives who were jealous of her poisoned her.
<>As a result of it, she and the child born to her fell
<>victims to diseases. Das4a1rn2a abandoned them in the
<>forest. Sumati lived in the house of a Vais4ya with her
<>child. While living there, the child died of disease. R2s2a- [Page651-b+ 65]
<>bha went to the grief-stricken Sumati and comforted her.
<>(S4iva Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%R2s2abha's End.%} R2s2abha performed tapas according to
<>the rules of Va1naprastha a1s4rama and conducted ya1gas
<>as ordained by S4a1stras. On account of his austerity he
<>became so lean and thin that all the veins in the body
<>could be seen. Putting a pebble in his mouth, he went
<>about in the forest, determined to renounce his body.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Chapter 1, Section 1).
<NI>In the course of his wanderings in the forest a wild fire

<>says that the soul of R2s2abha who died in the wild fire,
<>attained S4iva Loka.
<HI>R2S2ABHA III. A Na1ga born in the Dhr2tara1s2t2ra family.

<>Sarga, Verse 44).
<HI>R2S2ABHATI1RTHA. An ancient place of holy waters in
<>Ayodhya1. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 84 says

<HI>R2S2I. Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 348 states that the letter
<>“R2” means “sound”. The word “R2s2i” is derived from
<>this root. During the period when the art of writing
<>was not known, Vedas, S4a1stras and other sacred lore
<>were communicated through the mouth of the R2s2is.
<>The voice of A1r2s2a Bha1rata itself is the voice of the
<>R2s2is. Hindus believe that the Vedas are the outcome
<>of the inspiration, introspection and spiritual vision of
<>the R2s2is. There is a Sam3skr2ta stanza defining a R2s2i,
<>which is given below:
<Poem>U1rdhvareta1stapasya1gah2
<>Niyata1s4i1 ca sam3yami1 /
<>S4a1pa1nugrahayoh2 s4aktah2
<>Satyasandho bhavedr2s2ih2 //</Poem>
<NI>India has given birth to numerous R2s2is. The word
<>“R2s2i” may be found throughout the Vedas. R2s2is born
<>in all classes of people had lived in India. The general
<>belief is that the number of R2s2is may come to about
<>48,000. It is not possible to know the names of all of them.
<>In the Ra1ma1yan2a we find that when S4ri1 Ra1ma returned
<>to Ayodhya1 after his life in the forest and took up the
<>reign, many R2s2is came to Ayodhya1 from all parts of
<>the country. Among them, Vis4va1mitra, Yavakri1ta,
<>Raibhya, Kan2va and Garga came with their party of
<>disciples from the east; Datta1treya, Namuci, Pramuci,
<>Va1lmi1ki, Soma, Kun2d2u and Agastya came with their
<>disciples from the south; Vr2s2an3gu, Kavis2a, Kaumya, [Page652-a+ 65]
<>Raudreya, Na1rada, Va1madeva, Saubhari, As2t2a1vakra,
<>S4uka, Bhr2gu, Lomas4a, Maudgalya and others with their

<>Tumburu, the Saptars2is and others with their party of
<>disciples arrived from the north, according to Uttara
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. There are three classes of R2s2is--Brahmars2i,
<>Ra1jars2i and Devars2i. Vasis2t2ha was a Brahmars2i,
<>Visva1mitra, a Rajars2i and Kas4yapa, a Devars2i.
<HI>R2S2IGIRI. A mountain situated near Girivraja, the
<>capital of Magadha kingdom. This mountain is also
<>known as “Ma1tan3ga” (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 21,

<>67, Verses 32 and 33 state that he was the rebirth of
<>Arka, the Asura leader.
<HI>R2S2IKA II. A town in North India. A terrible battle
<>took place here between Arjuna and R2s2ika, the Ra1jars2i.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 27, Verse 25).
<HI>R2S2IKULYA1. A sacred river in ancient India. Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 47 mentions
<>that those who bathe in this river will attain Moks2a
<>(salvation).
<HI>R2S2YAMU1KA. A mountain. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 9 states that Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>visited the sage Ma1rkan2d2eya on the top of this moun-
<>tain. It was here that Ra1ma and Laks2man2a met
<>Sugri1va. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 279,
<>Verse 44 states that the river Pampa1 runs round the
<>R2s2yamu1ka mountain.
<HI>R2S2YAS4R2N3GA. Son of the sage Vibha1n2d2aka.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Vibha1n2d2aka, son of Kas4yapa was the father
<>of R2s2yas4r2n3ga. There is a strange story about him in
<>the Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>Once sage Vibha1n2d2aka happened to see Urvas4i1 at
<>Maha1hrada. At the very sight of her, the sage had an
<>involuntary emission of semen. The semen fell in the
<>water and just then a female deer came there to drink
<>water. It swallowed the semen with water and in due
<>course became pregnant and gave birth to a human
<>child. But the child had the horns of a deer. Conse-
<>quently Vibha1n2d2aka named the boy “R2s2yas4r2n3ga”.
<>Vibha1n2d2aka and R2s2yas4r2n3ga lived together in the
<>a1s4rama. R2s2yas4r2n3ga grew up into a youth, but he had
<>never seen anyone except his father Vibha1n2d2aka.
<NI>2) {%Rainfall in the kingdom of An3ga.%} At that time, the
<>kingdom of An3ga was ruled by Lomapa1da, a friend of
<>Das4aratha. Once he cheated a Bra1hman2a. Consequently
<>all the Bra1hman2as in that country left the place and
<>emigrated to other lands. From that time there was no
<>rain in the land of An3ga. A severe drought and famine
<>followed. Lomapa1da invited devout Bra1hman2as and
<>consulted them how they could bring rain to the land.
<>They told him that if he could get a Muni (sage) who
<>had never seen women to perform a ya1ga, there would
<>be rainfall in the land. The King sent his men far and
<>wide to find a Muni who had never set eyes on a wo-
<>man At last he got news that R2s2yas4r2n3ga, son of
<>Vibha1n2d2aka was the sage who had never seen women.
<>He then began to plan how R2s2yas4r2n3ga could be brought
<>over to An3ga.
<NI>Lomapa1da called together some prostitutes and asked
<>them whether they could bring R2s2yas4r2n3ga to his
<>country. All except one of them said it was quite [Page652-b+ 64]
<>impossible. One of them, however, agreed to try. As
<>desired by her, the King sent her with several other
<>damsels.
<NI>The young women went to the forest and made a
<>floating a1s4rama in a boat in which they sailed in the
<>river by the side of Vibha1n2d2a1ka's a1s4rama. They stopped
<>the boat close to the a1s4rama and one of the girls enter-
<>ed the a1s4rama when Vibha1n2d2aka was not there. She
<>had a talk with R2s2yas4r2n3ga in the course of which she
<>used all the amorous enchantments of her sex to captivate
<>the young Muni. She told him that she was the
<>daughter of a Muni, living in an a1s4rama, three yojanas
<>away. R2s2yas4r2n3ga felt a peculiar fascination for her and
<>tried to please her by offering fruits etc. When she left
<>him, he felt deeply distressed and unhappy. He was in
<>that depressed and gloomy state of mind when Vibha1n2d2aka
<>returned to the a1s4rama. Finding him unusually restless
<>and dejected, the father asked him whether anyone
<>had come there. R2s2yas4r2n3ga who was an entire stranger
<>to the feminine world told his father that a handsome
<>youth of irresistible charm had visited him during
<>Vibha1n2d2aka's absence. But from R2s2yas4r2n3ga's description
<>of the “youth” Vibha1n2d2aka understood that the visitor
<>must have been a woman. But he could not guess who
<>it was.
<NI>On another occasion, the same woman came again to
<>the a1s4rama in the absence of Vibha1n2d2aka. At her sight
<>R2s2yas4r2n3ga was enraptured and before his father's
<>return, they left the a1s4rama. They entered the floating
<>a1s4rama in the boat and the woman set the boat sailing
<>in the river. It glided slowly down the river and at
<>last reached near the palace of Lomapa1da. They landed
<>there and the King married his daughter Sa1nta1 to
<>R2s2yas4r2n3ga.
<NI>To appease Vidha1n2d2aka, Lomapa1da sent him rich
<>presents and much wealth. When Vibha1n2d2aka returned
<>to his a1s4rama he was met by the King's servants who
<>had brought the presents and wealth. Ignoring them
<>and their rich presents, the furious Mahars2i set out to
<>the city of Campa1, the capital of the An3ga Kingdom.
<>At the royal command, Vibha1n2d2aka was welcomed by
<>the people with honour. When the sage found that
<>the whole kingdom belonged to his son, his anger was
<>allayed. After ordering his son to return to his a1s4rama
<>after the birth of a son, Vibha1n2d2aka left the palace.
<>As a result of R2s2yas4r2n3ga's ya1ga there was rainfall in
<>An3ga and famine ended. After the birth of his child he
<>returned to the forest as ordered by his father. (M.B.
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapters 110-112).
<NI>3) {%R2s2yas4r2n3ga in Ayodhya1.%} King Das4aratha of Ayodhya1
<>had no children for a long time. His Minister
<>Sumantra advised him to invite R2s2yas4r2n3ga to perform
<>a ya1ga for the purpose. Lomapa1da sent R2s2yas4r2n3ga to
<>Ayodhya1 at the invitation of Das4aratha. He arrived at
<>Ayodhya1 and performed a ya1ga called Putraka1mes2t2i.
<>From the sacrificial fire there arose a dark monstrous
<>figure, with a pot of pudding in his hand. Das4aratha
<>received it from him and gave one half of it to Kau-
<>salya1 and the other half to Kaikeyi1. Both of them gave
<>half of their shares to Sumitra1. Thus Sumitra1 got two
<>shares while the other two wives of Das4aratha got only
<>one share each. As a result Kausalya1 and Kaikeyi1 gave
<>birth to a son each, while Sumitra1 had two sons.
<>Kausalya1's son was named Ra1ma, Kaikeyi1's son was [Page653-a+ 65]
<>Bharata and Sumitra1's sons were Laks2man2a and
<>S4atrughna. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Chapters
<>14-16).

<>Besides, in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 152, we see that it
<>also means “Something obtained by begging”.
<HI>R2TADHA1MA1. Another name of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B.

<HI>R2TADHVAJA I. (KUVALA1S4VA--DHUNDHUMA1RA).
<>A famous King of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Vis2n2u were descended in the
<>following order--Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Vivasva1n

<>Ka1kutstha--Anenas--Pr2thula1s4va--Vis2vagas4va--Adri--
<>Kuvala1sva (Dhundhuma1ra).
<NI>2) {%How he got the name Dhundhuma1ra.%} The most
<>heroic exploit of Kuvala1s4va or Kuvalaya1s4va was his
<>killing of the Asura Dhundhu.
<NI>Madhu and Kait2abha were two Asuras born from the
<>ears of Maha1vis2n2u. The Asura Dhundhu was their
<>son. After his birth, Maha1vis2n2u killed Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. Dhundhu was furious over the death of his
<>fathers. He worshipped Brahma1 who granted him
<>unconquerable strength. After defeating the gods he
<>went to the desert called Ujja1laka and lay beneath the
<>sands. Whenever he heaved a sigh clouds of dust rose
<>up to the sky and the earth shook for seven days. It
<>caused great damage to life and property in the world,
<>like a storm. Uttan3ka, a sage who lived in the
<>neighbourhood of Ujja1laka was the person who
<>suffered most from Dhundhu's misdeeds.
<NI>Br2hadas4va, of Iks2va1ku dynasty and father of Kuvala1s4va
<>in his old age entrusted the rule of the country to his
<>son and prepared to go to the forest. At that time,
<>sage Uttan3ka came there and advised the King to go
<>to the forest only after killing Dhundhu. Br2hadas4va
<>called his son Kuvala1s4va and after giving him the task
<>of killing Dhundhu, proceeded to the forest.
<NI>Kuvala1s4va had 21,000 sons. Leading them, he went to
<>the desert Ujja1laka to kill Dhundhu. Uttan3ka declared
<>that anyone who killed Dhundhu would get part of
<>Maha1vis2n2u's strength. Kuvala1s4va's sons surrounded
<>Dhundhu. The Asura awoke with anger. In the fire
<>from his eyes, all the 21,000 sons of Kuvala1s4va were
<>burnt to ashes. Next Kuvala1s4va came into conflict with
<>Dhundh2u. In that fight Dhundhu was killed. The gods
<>gave Kuvala1s4va many boons. From that day, Kuvala1 va
<>got the name, “Dhundhuma1ra” (one who killed
<>Dhundhu). (M.B. Vana Parva, 4 Chapters from 201).
<NI>3) {%His sons.%} Kuvala1s4va had three more sons named
<>Dr2d2ha1s4va, Kapila1s4va and Candra1s4va, or Bhadra1s4va
<>besides the 21,000 sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>204, Verse 40).
<NI>4) Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 59 gives the following
<>account of how Kuvala1s4va won the favour of sage
<>Ga1lava.
<NI>Long ago while sage Ga1lava was performing tapas in
<>his a1s4rama, an Asura called Pa1ta1laketu used to disturb
<>his meditations regularly. One day, the sage looked up
<>to Heaven and heaved a sigh. At once a horse dropped
<>down from the sky. A mysterious voice was heard
<>saying--“This mighty horse will travel thousands of [Page653-b+ 65]
<>yojanas in a day.” The sage received that horse and
<>presented it to R2tadhvaja, King of the lunar dynasty.
<>R2tadhvaja mounted the horse and killed Pa1ta1laketu.
<NI>It was Vis4va1vasu who dropped this horse from Heaven.
<>Pa1ta1laketu had once fallen in love with Vis4va1vasu's
<>daughter, Mada1lasa1. It was in revenge that Vis4va1vasu
<>had done like this.
<HI>R2TADHVAJA II. A Mahars2i (sage). The sage Ja1ba1li was
<>his son. (For further details, see Para 2 under the
<>word Vis4vakarma1).
<HI>R2TAMBHARA. An ancient King. He worshipped
<>Ka1madhenu and obtained a son who was a devotee of
<>Vis2n2u. The son's name was Satyava1n. In connection
<>with S4ri1 Ra1ma's As4vamedhaya1ga, S4atrughna who was
<>leading the horse, arrived in Satyava1n's city during
<>his tour of the eastern lands. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la

<HI>R2TUKA1LA. The time that is most auspicious for sexual
<>intercourse for a woman with her husband. In ancient
<>India certain days were prescribed as the best period for
<>women to become pregnant. This period is called
<>R2tuka1la. (R2tu--Menstruation. Ka1la--time, period.)
<NI>The sixteen days following menstruation are supposed
<>to be good; but the first three days are not very good
<>and it is advisable not to have sexual intercourse during
<>those days. The next even days beginning with the
<>fourth day (4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th and 16th)
<>are the best days for coitus if a male issue (a son) is
<>desired. The odd days (5th, 7th, 9th, 11th 13th, 15th)
<>are to be preferred if a female issue (daughter) is desired.

<NI>{%i) Nala's incognito life.%} While Nala was wandering in
<>the dense forest after leaving Damayanti1, he was bitten
<>by the serpent, Karkot2aka. His complexion turned blue
<>owing to the effect of the poison. Karkot2aka gave him
<>a garment by wearing which Nala could regain his form.
<>As advised by Karkot2aka, Nala went to the palace of
<>R2tuparn2a, king of Ayodhya1, assuming the name
<>Ba1huka. He lived there as the chief charioteer of the
<>king. He had mastered the art “As4vahr2daya” by which
<>he could drive the chariot-horses with astonishing speed.
<>R2tuparn2a appointed him as his chief charioteer and gave
<>him two assistants, Va1rs2n2eya and Ji1vala. (M.B.,
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 67).
<NI>{%(ii) R2tuparn2a and the second marriage of Damayanti.%}
<>Damayanti1 came to know that Nala was living in R2tu-
<>parn2a's palace, through the messenger Parn2a1da. She [Page654-a+ 65]
<>sent a secret mesage to Ayodhya1 through a Bra1hman2a
<>named Sudeva that her second marriage was fixed for
<>the next day and that R2tuparn2a should attend the
<>ceremony. R2tuparn2a started at once with Ba1huka as his
<>charioteer. On the way, R2tuparn2a's cloak happened to
<>fall down from the chariot. At once he asked Nala to
<>stop the chariot. But he told him that within a moment,
<>the chariot had covered a distance of one yojana from
<>the place where the cloak fell.
<NI>They saw a tree in the forest which was heavily laden
<>with fruit. R2tuparn2a was able to tell at a glance, the
<>exact number of leaves and fruits on that tree. He told
<>Nala that he was able to do so with the help of the art
<>“Aks2ahr2daya” and he taught it to Nala. In return for
<>it, Nala taught the king the art of As4vahr2daya. At last
<>they reached the city of Vidarbha. Damayanti1 managed
<>to recognize Nala even in his disguise. R2tuparn2a who
<>was happy over the reunion of Nala and Damayanti1
<>returned to Ayodhya1 on the next day. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 77).

<HI>RUDRA. A form of S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The birth of Rudra is from
<>Brahma1. Even before the creation of the Praja1patis,
<>Brahma1 had created Sanandana, Sanaka, Sana1tana and
<>Sanatkuma1ra. These four were not desirous of mundane
<>pleasures and were not prepared to beget children.
<>They were great sages and scholars, of abstinence and
<>without any discord and animosity. When these four
<>showed no interest at all in the creation of the world,
<>Brahma1 became angry to such an extent that he was
<>prepared to destroy the three worlds. At that time the
<>whole of the three worlds shone in the radiance that
<>emanated from the fire of the fury of Brahma1. Then
<>from his shining eyebrows which were curved with fury,
<>a figure of unbearable radiance like the mid-day sun
<>came out. That figure was Rudra. Half of the fierce
<>body of that Rudra who was very furious, was a woman
<>and the other half was a man. Brahma1, saying, “Divide
<>body”, disappeared. Instantly Rudra split himself into
<>the figure of a man and the figure of a woman. He
<>again divided the body of the man into eleven parts.
<>These eleven figures are the eleven Rudras.
<NI>The names of the eleven Rudras are given differently
<>in different Pura1n2as. In a text it is said that the eleven
<>Rudras are, Manyu, Manu, Mahi1nasa, Maha1n, S4iva, R2tu-
<>dhvaja, Ugraretas, Bhava, Ka1ma, Va1madeva and Dhr2ta-
<>vrata. According to some other Pura1n2as, the eleven
<>Rudras are Aja, Ekapa1da (Ekapa1t), Ahirbudhnya, Tvas2t2a1,
<>Rudra, Hara, S4ambhu, Tryambaka, Apara1jita, I1s4a1na
<>and Tribhuvana. Brahma1 apportioned to the eleven
<>Rudras the eleven positions of the heart, the five organs
<>of senses and the organs of action and to Rudra
<>the eight positions of life, ether, air, fire, water, earth,
<>the sun and the moon. It was said before that Rudra
<>was divided into man and woman. From the woman-
<>portion eleven Rudra1n2i1s came into being. They were
<>Dhi1, Vr2tti, Us4ana1, Uma1, Niyuta1, Sarpis, Ila1, Ambika1,
<>Ira1vati1, Sudha1 and Di1ks2a1. The eleven Rudran2i1s became
<>the wives of the eleven Rudras. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1.
<>Chapter 7).
<NI>2) {%Other information regarding Rudra.%} Details about
<>the orgin, life, character etc. of Rudra which occur in
<>other Pura1n2as are given below.
<NI>(i) Thirtythree children were born to Praja1pati Kas4ya-
<>pa, by his wife Aditi, as A1dityas, Vasus, Rudras and
<>As4vins. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 14).
<NI>(ii) From the fury of Brahma1, Rudra was born; from
<>the lap of Brahma1, Na1rada was born; from the right
<>thumb, Daks2a; from the mind, Sanaka and the others;
<>and from the left thumb, a daughter named Vi1ran2i1 was
<>born. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>(iii) In the beginning of Kalpa (Age of Brahma1)
<>Brahma1 meditated upon getting a child like himself
<>and a child of blue complexion appeared on his lap.
<>He ran here and there crying aloud. Brahma1 asked him
<>“Why are you crying?” He replied: “I must be named.”
<>Because he was crying (doing rodana) Brahma1
<>named him Rudra (He who cries). He cried seven times
<>more. Brahma1 gave him seven more names. They
<>were Bhava, S4arva, I1s4a1na, Pas4upati, Bhi1ma, Ugra and
<>Maha1deva. Thus there were eight Rudras. To each of
<>them, Brahma1 gave a position and wives and children. [Page655-a+ 65]
<>The Sun, water, earth, air, fire, ether, Brahmin who
<>has taken vow and the moon were allotted to them as
<>their positions and figures. Their wives were Suvarcala1,
<>Us2a1, Vikes4i1 S4iva1, Sva1ha1, Di1s4a1, Di1ks2a1 and Rohin2i1.
<>This world is filled by the sons and grandsons and so on
<>of these wives. Their sons respectively were S4anais4cara
<>S4ukra, Lohita1n3ga, Manojava, Skanda, Sarga, Santa1na
<>and Budha. This Rudra who is described above,
<>married Sati1 the daughter of Praja1pati Daks2a. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 8). (For further information
<>see under S4IVA also).
<HI>RUDRAKETU. An asura. Two sons named Deva1ntaka
<>and Nara1ntaka were born to this asura by his wife S4a1rada1.
<>The hermit Na1rada was greatly pleased at the valour of
<>these two sons, and taught them “Pan5ca1ks2ari1maha1vi-
<>dya1.” Deva1ntaka and Nara1ntaka, who became haughty
<>and arrogant by their prowess were killed by Gan2apati.

<>in the form of many phalluses. From that day onwards
<>the place Rudrakot2i became a holy place. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Stanza 118).
<HI>RUDRA1KS2A. (Elaco Carpus seeds) Beads for rosaries.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A holy thing worn by devotees.
<>In the Pura1n2as much importance is attached to Rudra1ks2a.
<>In Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 11, there is a story stating
<>how Rudra1ks2a came to be honoured in this way.
<NI>Once there lived an asura chief who was mighty and
<>valiant. His name was Tripura. He defeated Devas and
<>deva chiefs and became emperor of the asuras. The Devas
<>were much grieved because of him. They went to S4iva and
<>represented their grievances. S4iva thought for a while,
<>how to kill Tripura, and sat with open epes. This sitting
<>continued for a thousand divine years. After this pro-
<>longed time S4iva winked his eyes and tears fell down
<>from them. The Rudra1ks2a tree originated from these
<>tears. From the Sun-eye of S4iva twelve types of
<>Rudra1ks2as came into being; from the moon-eye sixteen
<>kinds of Rudra1ks2as and from the fire-eye ten kinds of
<>Rudra1ks2as originated. Those which originated from
<>the Sun-eye are blood coloured, those from the moon-eye
<>white Rudra1ks2as and from the fire-eye black rudra1ks2as.
<>Boiled Rudra1ks2a is considered a Brahmin caste, red
<>rudra1ks2a a Ks2atriya caste, white one a Vais4ya caste
<>and the black rudra1ks2a a S4u1dra caste.
<NI>2) {%Division of rudra1ks2a based on quality.%} The division of
<>rudra1ks2a according to the number of faces, and qualities
<>thereof are given below:

<>of S4iva. By wearing this remission from the sin of
<>Brahmahatya1 could be procured.
<NI>{%With two faces:%} Rudra1ks2a with two faces is the figure of
<>Devi1deva. This is known by the name “Gauri1s4an3kara”.
<>By wearing this remission from all sins committed know-

<NI>1) {%General information.%} King of the Province Bhoja-
<>kat2a in the country of Vidarbha. It is stated in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 62, that this
<>Rukmi1 was born from a portion of the Asura named
<>Krodhavas4a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Father of Rukmi1 was the king Bhi1s2maka.
<>Two children were born to Bhi1s2maka, named Rukmi1
<>and Rukmin2i1. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza
<>62).
<NI>3) {%Getting a bow.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a took Rukmi1's sister
<>Rukmin2i1 by force and married her. Rukmi1 did not like
<>this and so he confronted S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. In the contest S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a reviled him. Rukmi1 got angry at this and went to
<>Kaila1sa and did penance before S4iva. S4iva appeared
<>before him after three years, and gave him a bow for
<>destroying the enemies. S4iva told him that it would be
<>broken, only if it was used against Maha1vis2n2u. After
<>getting this bow he returned to Bhojakat2a and lived
<>there.
<NI>4) {%The details regarding Rukmi1, given in the Maha1bha1rata.%}
<NI>(i) Rukmi1 accepted the suzerainty of Sahadeva at the

<>Chapter 21, Stanza 62).
<NI>(ii) Rukmi1 paid tribute to Karn2a at the time of his

<>Stanza 14).
<NI>(iii) The Pa1n2d2avas had sent invitation to Rukmi1 for the
<>Bha1rata-battle. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Stanza 16).
<NI>(iv) Bhi1s2maka, the father of Rukmi1, was known
<>by the name ‘Hiran2yaroma1’ also. Rukmi1 became
<>famous throughout all the countries. He accepted
<>Druma, a famous Kimpurus2a (Kinnara) as his teacher
<>in archery. Druma presented him with a bow called
<>Vijaya. This Vijaya was on a par with the Ga1n2d2i1va.
<>Rukmi1 fought with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and was defeated. The
<>place at which he was defeated by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is known
<>as Bhojakat2a.
<NI>After having been defeated by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, a thought
<>arose in the mind of Rukmi1 to keep amity and concord
<>with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Knowing this, the Pa1n2d2avas invited
<>Rukmi1 to their palace. He promised his help if ever
<>Arjuna feared to do battle. At this Arjuna laughed and
<>said that he was not in need of any help. After this
<>Rukmi1 went to Duryodhana and promised to help him.
<>But Duryodhana also rejected his help. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 158).
<NI>5) {%Death of Rukmi1.%} Discontented with everybody, Rukmi1
<>lived in Bhojakat2a, having no contact with any body.
<>During this period the king of Kalin3ga once approached
<>Rukmi1 and advised him to challenge Balabhadrara1ma
<>for a game of dice. The challenge was made knowing
<>that Balabhadra was not a good player. Knowing that
<>to reject a challenge was not honourable, Balabhadra
<>went to play the game. Rukmi1 won the first round of
<>game. Staking everything, the second round of the
<>game began and Balabhadra won the game. But
<>Rukmi1 and the king of Kalin3ga did not accept the
<>victory. All the kings who witnessed the game sided
<>with Rukmi1. Instantly an ethereal voice said “Balabha-
<>drara1ma has won the game.” The friends of Rukmi1
<>did not accept the ethereal voice. They began to create
<>a tumult in the hall. Balabhadrara1ma who became
<>furious at this ridicule took a pestle of iron and killed [Page657-a+ 64]
<>Rukmi1 with one blow. The rest of the kings fled from
<>the place. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<HI>RUKMIN2I1. The chief queen of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} From the following Pura1n2ic statements, it
<>could be understood that Rukmin2i1 was the incarnation
<>of goddess Laks2mi1.
<NI>(i) “S4ri1 Devi1 (Laks2mi1) by her portions, took birth in
<>the earth as Rukmin2i1 in the family of Bhi1s2maka”.
<>(M.B, A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 156).
<NI>(ii) Formerly Laks2mi1 Devi1 took birth as the daughter
<>of Bhr2gu by his wife Khya1ti. Next she took birth from
<>the sea of Milk at the time of the churning of it by the
<>combined efforts of the devas and the asuras, to take
<>Amr2ta (ambrosia). When Vis2n2u took birth as A1ditya,
<>Laks2mi1 took birth from lotus. When Vis2n2u incarnated
<>as Paras4ura1ma Laks2mi1 Devi1 became the earth-goddess.
<>In the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma she became Si1ta1 and in
<>that of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a she was Rukmin2i1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Am2s4a 1, Chapter 9).
<NI>It was in the kingdom of Vidarbha that Laks2mi1 Devi1
<>took birth as Rukmin2i1 during the incarnation of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a. To Bhi1s2maka, the King of Vidarbha, five sons
<>beginning with Rukmi1, were born. The sixth was a
<>daughter who was named Rukmin2i1. She grew up into
<>a beautiful damsel. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Rukmin2i1 fell in love with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Her
<>parents agreed to her choice. But her brother Rukmi1
<>was an enemy of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Rukmi1 desired to give his
<>sister to S4is4upa1la. The date of the marriage was fixed
<>and the heart was burning within Rukmin2i1. She sent a
<>Brahmin as messenger to Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>The time of marriage drew near. The kings of An3ga,
<>Kalin3ga, Ma1lava, Kekaya, Van3ga, Magadha, Kosala,
<>Sa1lva, Cola, Pa1n2d2ya, Kerala and so on took their seats
<>in the nuptial hall. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra came
<>with their army. The army under the leadership of
<>Balabhadra remained behind and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went alone
<>to the nuptial hall. While preparations were being
<>made to give Rukmin2i1 to S4is4upa1la, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a took her
<>in his chariot and quickly left the place. All the other
<>kings who ran after S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to fight had to confront
<>with the mighty army of Balabhadra, who defeated the
<>kings and returned to Dva1raka1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>10).
<NI>3) {%Sons.%} It is mentioned in Bha1gavata, Skandha 10,
<>that ten sons were born to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a by Rukmin2i1.
<>They were Pradyumna, Ca1rudes2n2a, Sudes2n2a, Ca1rudeha,
<>Suca1ru, Ca1rugupta, Bhadraca1ru, Ca1rucandra, Ca1ru-
<>bhadra and Ca1ru. But a slight difference is observed in
<>the description of the sons of Ru1kmin2i1 given in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 14, Stanzas
<>33 and 34.
<NI>4) {%Yoked to the chariot by Durva1sas.%} See under Durva1sas,
<>Para 3.
<NI>5) {%Consoled Arjuna.%} After the death of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>Arjuna visited Dva1raka1. Seeing the dilapidated city
<>without rulers and the women without husbands, he
<>cried aloud. Rukmin2i1 Devi1 ran to him and consoled
<>him and seated him on a golden chair. (M.B.
<>Mausala Parva, Chapter 5, Stanza 12).
<NI>6) {%Death.%} After the death of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Rukmin2i1, with
<>the other wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a jumped into a burning pyre
<>and died.
<NI>“S4aibya1, Rukmin2i1, Ga1ndha1ri1, Haimavati1 and Ja1mba- [Page657-b+ 64]
<>vati1 jumped into the fire.” (M.B. Mausala Parva,
<>Chapter 7, Stanza 73).
<NI>7) {%The Palace of Rukmin2i1.%} There is a statement in the
<>Maha1bha1rata, Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>28, about the palace of Rukmin2i1. “Vis4vakarma1 built
<>a palace for S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a at the instance of Indra. The
<>highest dome of it is covered with gold. So this dome
<>dazzled as the peak of Maha1meru. It was this dome
<>that was set apart for his beloved wife Rukmin2i1 by S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a”.
<HI>RUMA1 I. A noble woman obtained from the sea of Milk
<>at the time of its churning by the devas and the asuras

<>Uccais4s4ravas, Kalpa tree, Cinta1man2i, Kaustubha, Candra
<>(Moon), Celestial maids, nymphs of heaven, Maha1-
<>laks2mi1, Ta1ra1, Ruma1 and so on were some of them.
<>(Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>RUMA1 II. The wife of Sugri1va. She was the daughter
<>of the famous monkey called Panasa. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, 3:7:221). After driving Sugri1va away from
<>Kis2kindha1, Ba1li took Ruma1 by force. After the death
<>of Ba1li, Ruma1 returned to Sugri1va. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 20, 21; Padma
<>Pura1n2a 4: 112:161).
<NI>There was Ruma1 also, among the women who came to

<>to kill Ren2uka1 who was late in fetching water from the
<>river. But Ruman2va1n did not obey his father. The
<>angry hermit cursed Ruman2va1n. According to the curse
<>Ruman2va1n became dull-witted like birds and beasts.

<NI>1) Genealogy. Descended from Vis2n2u in the following

<>Bhr2gu got the son Cyavana by Puloma1. Cyavana
<>married Sukanya1 the daughter of S4arya1ti. A son named
<>Pramati was born to them. The hermit Pramati
<>married the beautiful damsel Prata1pi1. Ruru is their
<>son. He grew up to be a famous hermit. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 2). [Page658-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} Ruru happened to see the exceedingly
<>beautiful Pramadvara1 the daughter of Vis4va1vasu by
<>Menaka1. The moment he saw her he fell in love with
<>her. The father of Pramadvara1 came to know of this
<>and he decided to give her in marriage to Ruru.
<>Preparations for the marriage were being made. One
<>day during that time Pramadvara1 who had been run-
<>ning here and there joyfully, was bitten by a snake
<>and she fell down dead. Ruru instantly reached the
<>spot.
<NI>Ruru who was greatly sad and disappointed, got down
<>to the Ganges and bathed. Then rinsing his mouth
<>he took some water in his hand and said “By the
<>favour of God I have acquired by my devotion and
<>worship of gods, devotion and service to my teacher,
<>by my scripture-study, my worship with Ga1yatri1, my
<>prayer, and meditation, my penance, my offerings to
<>the holy fire, and my oblations, let her come to life.
<>If she does not come to life, I will die in this Ganges
<>water.” Making this prayer, making the gods witnesses
<>he poured the water down.
<NI>Immediately a messenger from heaven appeared in the
<>sky and said that she would come to life again provided
<>Ruru was prepared to give half of his life to her. Ruru
<>agreed to it. Thus Pramadvara1 came to life again and
<>Ruru married her. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 2).
<NI>4) {%Hatred towards Serpents.%} A relentless hatred grew up
<>in the heart of Ruru against serpents, because a serpent
<>had killed his wife. He wandered about destroying
<>every serpent he come across. Finally when he confronted
<>D2un2d2ubha he was given exhortations and good advices
<>regarding righteousness by D2un2d2ubhla. (M.B. A1di Parva
<>Chapter 9, Stanza 19). Moreover it is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 12, that Ruru had
<>taken a lively interest in the sacrifice of Janamejaya
<>meant for the extermination of serpents.
<HI>RURU II. A mighty and valiant Asura. After procur-
<>ing a boon from Brahma1, Ruru became arrogant and
<>attacked the realm of gods. The Devas who were de-
<>feated by Ruru ran to the Blue mountain and prostrat-
<>ed before the goddess S4akti, who had been doing
<>penance there. This goddess S4akti had been born from
<>the matted hair of S4iva.
<NI>Ruru followed the Devas and reached the Blue moun-
<>tain. When Devi1 saw Ruru and his mighty army a
<>loud laugh burst out from her. From that laugh thou-
<>sands of devilish figures came into existence. They

<>Devi1 killed Ruru with the nail of her toe. (Padma

<>world. Both got ready and started. But Rus4ama1
<>walked round Kuruks2etra and returned, while Indra
<>travelled the whole of the way round the world and
<>kept the conditions. The question arose as to who won
<>the bet. The devas gave the decision, “Kuruks2etra is
<>the dais of Brahma1, and so Kuruks2etra contains the
<>entire world. Therefore both Indra and Rus4ama1 were
<>declared to have won the bet.”
<HI>RUS2AN3GU. An ancient hermit. Once the great
<>hermit A1rs2t2is2en2a came to the hermitage of Rus2an3gu and

<>wards the end of his life Rus2an3gu and his sons came to
<>Pr2thu1dakati1rtha and sang laudatory songs about
<>Pr2thu1dakati1rtha. Rus2an3gu said that those who did
<>penance and died in this holy bath would not have to
<>undergo miseries after death. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 39, Stanza 24).

<>‘Rucika’ also. The book of criticism called “Alan3ka1ra-
<>sarvasva” is written by him. He was the teacher of
<>Man3kha, the author of S4ri1kan2t2hacarita’. Some are of
<>opinion that Ruyyaka had written only the Su1tras in
<>the book ‘Alan3ka1rasarvasva’ and that the gloss or
<>commentary was given by Man3kha. Some of the other
<>works of Rucika are Sahr2dayali1la1, Alan3ka1ra1nusaran2i1
<>etc.
<H>S
<HI>S4A ({#Sa#}). The letter S4a means to lie down and also

<HI>S4ABALA1S4VA I. The thousand sons born to Daks2a of
<>his wife Vi1ran2i1, are known as S4abala1s4vas. To procre-
<>ate man-kind Daks2a first created five hundred sons by
<>his wife Asikni1 and named them Haryas4vas.
<>Daks2a had to create the S4abala1s4vas as the Haryas4vas
<>were misled by Na1rada. But, Na1rada approached and
<>told the S4abala1s4vas also that it was not correct on
<>their part to procreate children before they had studied
<>the interior, exterior, bottom and top of the earth.
<>Believing Na1rada's advice the S4abala1s4vas also set out
<>to measure the extent of the earth and they have not
<>yet returned. Because of this Brahma1 cursed that
<>Na1rada, instead of living at one place, should always
<>be on the move. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 15).
<HI>S4ABALA1S4VA II. A King born in the dynasty of King
<>Kuru. His father, Aviks2it or As4vava1n was the grand-

<HI>S4ABARA. A mleccha--low caste. The Maha1bha1rata
<>has the following about S4abaras.
<NI>(i) S4abaras were born from the dung and urine of

<>Verse 16).
<NI>(ii) When Sa1tyaki annihilated the Kauravas the dead
<>bodies of thousands of S4abaras were heaped on the
<>battle-field. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter 119, Verse 46).
<NI>(iii) In early days the S4abaras lived in the kingdom
<>of Ma1ndha1ta1, their profession being murder and loot-
<>ing. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 13).
<NI>(iv) S4iva had once taken the form of forest-dwellers
<>and S4abaras. (Anus4a1sana Parva. Chapter 65, Verse
<>17).
<NI>(v) Many Ks2atriyas lived for many years hidden in
<>caves for fear of Paras4ura1ma, and as they had no
<>association with ks2atriyas during the period, they
<>became S4abaras. (As4vamedhika Parva, Chapter 29,
<>Verse 15).
<HI>S4ABARI1. A woman of the tribe of forest-dwellers. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma, during his life in the forest, gave her salvation.
<NI>1) {%Former life.%} S4abari1, in her former life, was the only
<>daughter Ma1lini1 of the Gandharva King, Citrakavaca.
<>An erudite scholar, Vi1tihotra, married her. As he was
<>ever immersed in contemplation of Brahman his wife
<>Ma1lini1, (later S4abari1) kept one hunter, Kalma1s2a, as
<>her paramour, and her husband cursed her thus: “As
<>you have become a lover of the hunter, you turn out
<>to be a hunter-woman.”
<NI>2) {%At the Suburbs of Matan3ga's hermitage.%}
<>Ma1lini1 in tears sought redemption from the curse from
<>her husband, and he told her that she would get ab-
<>solution from her infamy and the curse from S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Immediately she was transformed into a hunter-woman
<>and she came to the suburbs of Matan3ga1s4rama. She took
<>a special liking for the place, the reason being that the
<>flowers in the a1s4rama possessed a special fragrance.
<>Once while the disciples were carrying a load of
<>flowers for the muni (Matan3ga) a few drops of sweat
<>from their bodies fell on the ground, and the muni
<>blessed that the trees and creepers, which grew up
<>from the sweat and their flowers would never fade.
<>This is described as follows in Canto 73, Aran2yaka1n2d2a
<>of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>“Oh! Ra1ma! nobody plucks and wears those flowers.
<>They neither fade nor fall down. While the disciples of
<>Matan3ga were carrying a load of flowers for him, they
<>sweated on account of exhaustion and some drops of
<>sweat fell on earth which developed themselves into
<>flowers due to the prowess of the guru's tapas. Even
<>today may be seen there S4abari1, who has taken to
<>sannya1sa and who tends the flowers. She will attain
<>heaven only after seeing you.”
<NI>S4abari1 lived for long there serving Matan3ga's disciples,
<>performing tapas and learning knowledge about
<>Brahman. At the time of the munis giving up their
<>physical bodies they blessed S4abari1 that without further
<>delay she would meet Ra1ma and get redemption from
<>the curse. They also blessed that she would possess
<>divine eyes to see hidden things and also the past and
<>the future. After that she was spending her days await-
<>ing the arrival of Ra1ma.
<NI>It was the period of the life in the forest of Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a. After visiting various a1s4ramas Ra1ma at
<>last came to Matan3ga1s4rama. Hearing about Ra1ma's [Page659-b+ 65]
<>visit S4abari1 had gathered a lot of fruits. Now, Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a came and S4abari1 received them most
<>respectfully. After herself biting each fruit to test its
<>taste she gave the fruits for them to eat. The left-overs
<>of S4abari1 appeared as nectar to Ra1ma. Then S4abari1
<>told Ra1ma thus: “When you go a short distance south-
<>wards there is the beautiful stream called Pampa1. You
<>cross Pampa1 and advance a little further and you will
<>reach mount R2s2yamu1ka. On the top of that mountain
<>lives Sugri1va, son of Sun, and if you enter into alliance
<>with him you will succeed in finding out and getting
<>back Si1ta1 after annihilating the enemies. Oh! Lord!
<>my salutations.”
<NI>After speaking thus, S4abari1 the great anchorite and
<>chaste woman closed her eyes. Immediately she was
<>transformed into Ma1lini1, the Gandharva damsel, and
<>all at once a handsome Gandharva prince appeared there
<>in a divine plane. It was Vi1tihotra, the husband of
<>Ma1lini1. After saluting S4ri1 Ra1ma he took away his wife
<>in a chariot to the Gandharva city. (Kamba Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a).
<HI>S4ABARIMALA (S4ABARI MOUNTAIN). A sacred
<>place in South India in the eastern region of Kerala on
<>a mountain called S4abarimala. It is not quite certain
<>whether the name of this mountain is in any way related
<>to S4abari1, to whom S4ri1 Ra1ma had given salvation. At
<>any rate a very ancient temple with S4a1sta1 as the presid-
<>ing deity therein is found at S4abarimala today. It is
<>proof positive of the great sanctity attached to the anci-
<>ent temple that every year lakhs of devotees from all
<>parts of India visit it braving dense forests, mountains
<>and wild beasts on their way. Historical evidence
<>about the origin of the temple or its philosophical
<>importance is sparse, but there is a legend, more illu-
<>minating than facts of history, about S4a1sta1 (Ayyappan)
<>the deity installed in the temple. The legend is as
<>follows--
<NI>In olden days the royal family of the Pa1n2d2yas divided
<>itself into two branches, one of them settling down at
<>Velliyu1r and the other at Madura. When the king of
<>Madura one day went ahunting in the forest he met
<>a handsome and very powerful and courageous Malaya1li
<>youth. The king immediately took a liking for him and
<>appointed him as an officer in his army. The youth
<>gradually rose up in military service to become the
<>Commander-in-Chief. The other officers, who were
<>jealous due to the rise of the youth--Ayyappan--began
<>conspiring to drive him out. The queen became a
<>weapon in the hands of the conspirators, and at their
<>instance she pretended herself to be very ill and lay in
<>a fainting fit. All the physicians acknowledged defeat
<>in curing her. Then a physician, an agent of the conspira-
<>tors, came forward and assured the king that he would
<>cure the queen of her illness within one and a half hours
<>if a leopard's milk was made available. The king told
<>Ayyappan about it.
<NI>Ayyappan went into the forest and returned to the
<>palace with many she-leopards. He rode a tiger lead-
<>ing the leopards. People in the royal court were fright-
<>ened by the sight of the leopards. The King realised
<>that Ayyappan was not an ordinary person. Being
<>questioned about him by the King, Ayyappan replied
<>that God was his father and the whole world his home.
<>As he did not like to live any further with tale-bearers
<>and conspirators he returned to Kerala. [Page660-a+ 65]
<>Ayyappan's departure made the King sad and very
<>restless in mind. After giving all his immovable pro-
<>perty on rent the King followed Ayyappan to Kerala
<>taking all his ornaments, jars and other utensils, and
<>came at last to Pantalam. This region of Kerala was
<>then in the control of a petty Chieftain called Kaip-
<>puzha Tampa1n. The King of Madura purchased some
<>land from the Tampa1n, put up a palace there and lived
<>therein with the members of his family.
<NI>Ayyappasva1mi1 on his way back to Kerala met Paras4u-
<>ra1ma, who told the former that he had already, for the
<>protection of Kerala, installed on mountains and the
<>sea-coast idols of his (Ayyappasva1mi1) and that he would
<>install another idol of Ayyappan at S4abarimala where
<>they had now met each other. From that day onwards
<>Ayyappasva1mi1 took his abode there.
<NI>One of those days the Pa1n2d2yan king living at Pan-
<>talam had a dream, and in that dream Ayyappasva1mi1
<>appeared and told him that he (Ayyappan) was living
<>at S4abarimala and the King might meet the Sva1mi1 if
<>he went there. The next day morning the King with
<>his retinue started for S4abarimala. At S4abarimala the
<>King got the forest cleared and made a search of the
<>ground where he found an idol installed by Paras4ura1ma.
<>The King built a temple there and installed the idol of
<>Ayyappasva1mi1 therein. He also got necessary purifica-
<>tory ceremonies conducted in the temple by the famous
<>tantri1 (high-priest) Ta1zhaman2. A routine programme
<>for the conduct of affairs in the temple was fixed. As
<>it was difficult for men to live in the forest infested by
<>wild beasts and conduct pu1ja1 etc. daily, it was fixed that
<>pu1ja1s need be conducted only for five days in every
<>month and that Makarasam3kra1nti should be the annual
<>festival day. From the first of Makaram3 (January) for
<>five days it was to be utsava with the deity led in pro-
<>cession. On the fifth of Makaram every year a
<>‘Kalabham’ and on the seventh day a ‘guruti’ also were
<>ordained.
<NI>On the annual festival day the temple priest, the senior
<>pilgrim, ma1ra1rs and other employees go to S4abarimala
<>carrying with them rice etc. for food and calling
<>aloud ‘Sva1miye S4aran2am Ayyappa’ (Oh! lord Ayyappa!
<>you are our refuge), devotees climb the mountain to-
<>day also repeating this slogan. (See under S4a1sta1).
<HI>S4A1BHA1KA1 (S4ALA1KA1). See under Dhanan5jaya V.

<HI>SABHA1PATI. A prince who took the side of the Kauravas
<>and fought against the Pa1n2d2avas. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Karn2a Parva, Chapter 89, S4tanza 64, that

<HI>S4ACI1. Daughter of Puloma1 and wife of Indra. The
<>following information about S4aci1 is gathered from the

<NI>(1) It was from an aspect of S4aci1 that Pa1n5ca1li1, daughter
<>of King Drupada was born. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67,
<>Verse 157).
<NI>(2) S4aci1 is seated on the best throne in the assembly of
<>Devas in the court of Indra. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7,

<>and Satyabha1ma1, during their visit to Devaloka to the
<>Devama1ta1. (mother of Devas). (Sabha1 Parva, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tyapa1t2ha, Chapter 38).
<NI>(5) When Indra, afflicted by Brahmahatya1, hid himself
<>away from Devaloka S4aci1devi1 was kept under the pro-
<>tection of Br2haspati. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Verse 20).
<NI>(6) While he was made Indra, Nahus2a wanted to take
<>S4aci1 for wife and she tried hard not to fall into his
<>clutches. (See under Nahus2a).
<NI>(7) S4aci1 was present at the birth of Subrahman2ya.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 13).
<HI>SADA1CA1RA (Good conduct).
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Each country has good custom-
<>ary practices of its own. A man with good habits or
<>behaviour is considered as having conquered the two
<>worlds. The sound ‘Sat’ denotes ‘Sa1dhus.’ Sa1dhus are
<>those who are without any bad conduct or behaviour.
<>The habits and practices of the Sa1dhus are called
<>Sada1ca1ra. The Saptars2is, (the seven hermits), the
<>Praja1patis (Lords of all creatures) and Manus (the
<>fathers of men), were persons who were careful to keep
<>up the good practices. Once the hermit Aurva advised
<>Sagara, what the good usages of the people of Bha1rata
<>ought to be. The laws of good conduct according to
<>hermit Aurva are given below:
<NI>2) {%The passing of excrement and urine.%} Every one should
<>wake up in the Bra1hmamuhu1rta (Two hours before
<>dawn). After having risen, he should go to the south-
<>west corner of the village or house at a distance of an
<>arrow-shot for stooling and passing urine; should not
<>pour the water used for washing the face and the legs,
<>in the courtyard; should not pass urine in one's own
<>shadow, or in the shade of a tree, or facing cow, the
<>Sun, fire, wind, teacher and Brahmin. Ploughed fields,
<>fields where grains are ready for harvest, cattleshed,
<>crowd, path, lakes or rivers and their banks, are places,
<>forbidden for stooling or passing urine. When there is
<>no danger, a wise man should pass urine, facing the
<>north in the day and facing south at night. When
<>passing excrement the ground should be covered with
<>grass and his head should be covered with cloth. Should
<>not sit long or talk much when stooling.
<NI>3) {%The conduct of ablution after answering the calls of
<>nature and rinsing the mouth after meals.%} Soil such as taken
<>from white ant-hill, ground thrown up by moles or rats,
<>soil at the bottom of water, remainder of soil used by
<>another, soil taken from the wall, soil gathered by worms
<>and flies, ploughed soil etc. should not be used for ablu-
<>tion. By using soil, do the cleansing of the urethra
<>once, the anus thrice, the left hand ten times, and both
<>the hands together, seven times. After this use pure
<>water (in which there is no mud or foam and which has
<>no foul smell) and rinse the mouth. Take soil again
<>and wash the legs with it. Rinse the mouth thrice and
<>wipe the face twice. Then holding water in the hand,
<>touch the apertures in the head such as eye, etc. the
<>crest of the head, both upper arms, navel and heart.
<>With this rinsing take bath. After bath, with the help
<>of a mirror, tie the hair, anoint the eyes with collyrium,
<>and wear flower garlands etc. carefully. Bathing should
<>be done in river, rivulet, lake, jungle-stream, mountain [Page661-a+ 65]
<>or holy bath (ti1rtha), or draw water from the well and
<>bathe there or carry well-water home and bathe there.
<>After the bath put on clean dress. Then take some
<>water in the hand, offer it as oblation to gods, sages, and
<>the manes with care. Throw water thrice for the
<>blessing of the gods and hermits and to Praja1pati once,
<>as ordained. In the same way, to the manes and the
<>great ancestors also give oblation of water thrice.
<NI>After so much is done do the customary sacrificial
<>offerings, prayer etc. to Devi1. Then invite guests to the
<>house and welcome them. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 3,
<>Chapter 11).
<HI>SADA1JIT. A king of the dynasty of Bharata. He was the
<>son of Kunti1 and the father of Ma1his2ma1n. (Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).
<HI>SADA1KA1NTA1. A river in India, Pura1n2ically very famous.
<>Mention is made of this river in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 25.
<HI>SADA1NI1RA1. A river in India very famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>Mention is made of this river in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma

<>opinion that this river is the same as the Karatoya1 of
<>Modern India.
<HI>S2AD2ARBHAKA(S). Six sons of Mari1ci. Subjected to a
<>curse they had to live many lives and ultimately they
<>resumed their old forms as children of Devaki1. (For

<>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Stanza 12, that
<>this king remains in the palace of Yama, glorifying him.
<HI>SADASYORMI. A king. He is a worshipper of Yama.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Stanza 11).
<HI>S2AD2GUN2A I. The six qualities or attributes of Bha-

<>(prowess), Vaira1gyam (non-attachment or renunciation),
<>Vijn5a1nam (super-knowledge), S4ri1 (welfare and prosper-
<>ity) and Yas4as (fame, reputation) are the six attributes
<>of Bhagava1n.
<HI>S2AD2GUN2A II. Six kingly or political policies. Sandhi,
<>Vigraha, Ya1na, A1sana, Dvaidha and A1s4raya are the six
<>policies of state-craft. (Manusmrti, Chapter 8, Verse
<>160)
<NI>1) {%Sandhi.%} To enter into peace and concord with the
<>enemy is Sandhi. One may make peace for one's own
<>benefit with the enemy, who is powerful and is fighting.
<>There are sixteen kinds of sandhi called Kapa1lasandhi,
<>etc. No kind of peace or treaty should be made with
<>twenty kinds of kings, i.e. infants; old men; one suffer-
<>ing from chronic disease; cast out by one's own people;
<>coward; one whose supporters are cowards; miser; one
<>whose people are misers; who is very much addicted to
<>women and such other material things; one, who has
<>not a mind of one's own and is ruled by more than one
<>adviser; he, who does not respect Devas and brahmins;
<>one hated or forsaken by God; blasphemer; one subject
<>to scarcity and sorrow; one not with satisfactory army;
<>local person; one with many enemies; one whose days are
<>numbered and one devoid of truth and righteousness.
<>One shall only fight and not enter into peace with the
<>above types of people.
<NI>2. {%Vigraha.%} Fighting, i.e. war is vigraha. War is the
<>result of mutual evil-doings. The king, who desires pros-
<>perity who is troubled by others and in whose favour
<>time and circumstances are, should go in for
<>war. The main causes of war are the following: [Page661-b+ 65]
<>the desire to capture kingdom, woman, position
<>etc. haughtiness and imperiousness, obstruction to
<>duties and rights, the interest of friends and allies,
<>destruction to one's allies, both parties getting interested
<>in one and the same thing etc. Enmity is engendered
<>chiefly due to the following causes:-rivalry of co-wives,
<>disputes about property and women, verbal controversies
<>and wrongs committed. The following kinds of wars
<>should not be fought:-Wars the benefit of which is
<>meagre or futile; war which would cause harm in the
<>present as also in future; with the enemy whose strength
<>is not correctly known; incited by others, for others, on
<>account of women, which would continue for long; with
<>brahmins, where time and fate are not in favour;
<>with him, who has powerful allies, though of temporary
<>advantage but which will not be so in future; though
<>of advantage in future but useless at present.
<NI>The king should always do what will be of advantage
<>at present as also in future. If one's own army is strong
<>and enthusiastic and when the army of the adversary is
<>not so, one may go in for war. Also, when all circum-
<>stances are in one's favour and against the antagonist
<>one may fight.
<NI>3) {%Ya1na.%} Ya1na means marching for war. One may
<>start for war after declaring it, after making peace, after
<>making alliances; and incidentally also.
<NI>4) {%A1sana.%} To remain quiet or doing nothing which is
<>also of four kinds as ya1na.
<NI>5) {%Dvaidha.%} To get in between the contending parties
<>to support with words only and to remain without join-
<>ing either side is dvaidha. He who takes up the stand
<>should, on meeting both the parties, serve the stronger
<>side. But if he finds that both the parties are making
<>peace, and not in need of his aid, he should approach
<>their enemy, who is more powerful than they, or he
<>should fight by himself.
<NI>6) {%A1s4raya.%} When one is attacked by a stronger enemy
<>and if one finds no means to retaliate, one should depend
<>upon another person, who is noble, truthful and power-
<>ful. To put on a supplicant's look, to understand the
<>moods of that person whose help is sought and to be
<>humble to him--these are the characteristics and traits of
<>the dependent. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 240.
<HI>SA1DHU. An incarnation of S4iva. The Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>contains the following story about it.
<NI>When the Hima1laya and Maina1ka mountains once
<>began a very intense tapas, the Devas and R2s2is fearing
<>great ruin to the world in case the mountains got salva-
<>tion, sought S4iva's protection and prayed for a solution
<>for the problem. So S4iva, in the guise of a brahmin
<>named Sa1dhu, went to the mountains, spoke to them
<>condemning S4iva and thus made them retract from their
<>devotion to S4iva.
<HI>SA1DHYA1. Mother of the Sa1dhyas. (See under Sa1dhyas).
<HI>SA1DHYA (S).
<NI>1. {%General.%} A Gan2adevata1. These Devata1s often used to
<>play an important role in Pura1n2ic movements and inci-
<>dents. The Sa1dhyas were born from the seed Vira1t2
<>Purus2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 35). But accord-
<>ing to Vis2n2u Pura1n2a (Part 1, Chapter 35) the Sa1dhyas
<>were the grand-children of Daks2a-praja1pati. Of the sixty
<>daughters of the Praja1pati by his wife Asikni1, ten were
<>married by Dharmadeva; The Vis4vadevas were the
<>sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Vis4va1 and the Sa1dhyas
<>were his sons by Sa1dhya1. [Page662-a+ 64]

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Ba1huka, father of Sagara, was known as
<>Suba1hu also. Sagara was Ba1huka's son by his wife,
<>Ya1davi1. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 16). Though
<>Sagara was a prince he was born at the a1s4rama of
<>Aurva, and there was a reason for it.
<NI>Suba1hu and Ya1davi1 did not have a child for long. But,
<>as a result of many yajn5as conducted for the gift of a
<>child, Ya1davi1 conceived. While she was in the seventh
<>month of her pregnancy her co-wife administered poison
<>to her with the result that she did not further advance
<>in pregnancy and deliver in due time. Thus she con-
<>tinued as a pregnant woman for seven years. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 16). The King became an old man.
<>During this period Ta1lajan3gha, king of Hehaya, at-
<>tacked Ayodhya1 with his army, and Suba1hu, despite his
<>old age, fought back. But the fighting grew fiercer.
<>Suba1hu found that he would not be able to defeat
<>Ta1lajan3gha and so he escaped into the forest with his [Page662-b+ 63]
<>wife Ya1davi1. They took shelter in the a1s4rama of sage
<>Aurva. Suba1hu expired there due to old age and
<>Ya1davi1 got ready to follow him in his pyre. The Muni
<>prevented her from doing so by pointing out to her
<>that the child in her womb was a very fortunate one
<>and would become emperor of the seven islands when
<>he grew up to manhood. Ya1davi1 delivered shortly.
<>As the poison (gara) given to her by the co-wife had
<>immobilised her pregnancy for so long Aurva named
<>her child Sagara. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapters 16
<>and 17).
<NI>3) {%To Ayodhya1.%} Sage Aurva conducted the Upanayana
<>ceremony of the boy and taught him the Vedas ete.
<>Once Ya1davi1 wept to hear the boy address the muni
<>‘father’, and when the son asked her the reason for it
<>she told him that the muni was not his father, who
<>was really greater than the muni. She also told him
<>their previous history, and Sagara decided to return to
<>Ayodhya1 somehow.
<NI>The people of Ayodhya1 lived scattered here and there
<>in fear of Ta1lajan3gha, and disgusted with such an exis-
<>tence, they came together and took refuge with Vasis2-
<>t2ha, who told them that king Suba1hu had expired in
<>Aurva1s4rama, but that his son Sagara was there in
<>the a1s4rama. He further advised them to bring Sagara
<>back and reconquer Ayodhya1. Ya1davi1 wept at the
<>sight of the people from Ayodhya1 and they insisted
<>upon Sagara's return to the state as their king. They
<>waited in the a1s4rama for five days for Sagara. Then
<>Sagara and his mother, with the blessings of the Sage,
<>returned to Ayodhya1 along with the people. Sagara
<>fought Ta1lajan3gha, reconquered Ayodhya1 and crowned
<>himself as king. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapters 20 to 23).
<NI>4) {%Family life.%} Sagara had two wives called Sumati
<>alias Vaidarbhi1 and Kes4ini1 alias S4aibya1. Sumati was
<>the daughter of Garud2a.
<NI>As he had no issues for long, Sagara, with his wives,
<>went to Hima1layas and began doing tapas at Bhr2gupra-
<>sravan2a mountain. After hundred years Bhr2gu
<>appeared and blessed Sagara that one of his wives would
<>give birth to 60,000 sons and the other to one, who
<>would add to the glory of the dynasty. Sumati chose
<>60,000 sons and Kes4ini1 the one son.
<NI>The king and the queens returned to Ayodhya1 and in
<>due course Sumati delivered the son called Asaman5jasa
<>who was to bring prosperity to the dynasty. Sumati
<>gave birth to a lump of flesh, which developed into
<>60,000 children. They were put in pots of ghee and
<>they grew up to become young persons. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1nd2a, Canto 33).
<NI>Some Pura1n2as contain stories somewhat different from
<>the above about the birth of the 60,000 children.
<>e.g. in the 9th Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata, the story
<>is related as follows; “Kes4ini1 delivered the son
<>Asaman5jasa and Sumati did not deliver at all. So she
<>did tapas for S4iva for children and because of his bless-
<>ing she conceived. Sumati delivered only hundred
<>years after continuing to be pregnant, and even that
<>was only a piece of flesh, and she began weeping add-
<>ressing S4iva, who appeared before her and cut the
<>mass of flesh into 60,000 parts. Each piece of flesh
<>transformed itself into a very powerful and effulgent
<>man. [Page663-a+ 64]
<NI>5) {%Loss of children.%} Kapila turned into ashes the
<>60,000 sons of Sagara. Bhagi1ratha revived them. (For
<>details see under Bhagi1ratha).
<NI>6) {%Triumphal tour.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom well and
<>while living happily thus with his sons, he set out on a
<>triumphal tour. After conquering the northern regions
<>he moved towards the south, his object being Ma1his2-
<>mati1, Kingdom of the Hehayas. He destroyed the
<>Hehayas completely in battle. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 89 and 90).
<NI>7) {%Evening of life.%} Sagara ruled the kingdom for 300
<>years. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 91). His son,
<>Asaman5jasa was a tormentor of his subjects. In the
<>evening of his life, Sagara transmitted the throne to
<>his grandson Am3s4uma1n (son of Asaman5jasa). The
<>rest of his life he spent in Aurva1s4rama with his wife
<>engaged in meditation.

<>Only those facts, which have not been so related are

<NI>1) {%A brief biographical sketch.%} Sahadeva was the son of
<>Pa1n2d2u by his wife Ma1dri1. Two sons, Nakula and
<>Sahadeva were born to Ma1dri1 by the As4vini1devas.
<>Along with Yudhis2t2hira, Bhi1ma and Arjuna, sons of
<>Kunti1, Nakula and Sahadeva spent their childhood in
<>the company of Sages at S4atas4r2n3ga mountain. Pa1n2d2u
<>died and Ma1dri1 followed him in the funeral pyre. After
<>that the Pa1n2d2avas lived at Hastina1pura under the care
<>of Kunti1. When the ‘lac-palace’ was burnt down, they
<>took themselves to the forest and ruled the kingdom
<>with Indraprastha as capital. The Pa1n2d2avas, who
<>were defeated in the game of dice went again into
<>the forest. Their going into the forest has been des-
<>cribed as follows by Vidura.
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira, covering his face with cloth and Bhi1ma
<>stretching out his powerful hands moved into the
<>forest. Arjuna followed them throwing up sand par-
<>ticles. Sahadeva went rubbing his face with earth,
<>Nakula, the most handsome of men, followed them,
<>his body smeared with dust. Pa1n5ca1li1, her face con-
<>cealed in hair and weeping went behind the king. Sage
<>Dhaumya with Kus4a grass in his hands, accompanied
<>them chanting Vedic hymns. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>80).
<NI>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked Vidura why the Pa1n2d2avas assumed
<>these different poses and attitudes and Vidura answered
<>him thus: Yudhis2t2hira covered his face to show that
<>he would not retaliate in anger though he had lost the
<>kingdom due to cheating. Bhi1ma stretched out his
<>hands to show that he was unrivalled in manual power.
<>Arjuna threw out sand to say that he would shoot his
<>arrows into the enemy camp like particles of sand.
<>Sahadeva rubbed earth on his face as he did not want
<>anybody to distinguish his face. Nakula, the most
<>handsome of men, smeared his face with dust so that,
<>on the way, women should not desire him.
<NI>When the Pa1n2d2avas returned after twelve years' stay in
<>exile in the forest and one year's stay incognito
<>Duryodhana refused to allot them even a single house,
<>and war for eighteen days between the Kauravas and
<>the Pa1n2d2avas was fought in the field of Kuruks2etra.
<>The Kauravas were wiped out. Yudhis2t2hira became
<>king and performed the Rajasu1yayajn5a after which the
<>Pa1n2d2avas went out on the great journey and gave up
<>their lives.

<>battle. (See under Ba1n2a IV). Then ensued a fierce
<>battle between Ra1ma and Sahasramukha, the latter
<>aided by Candragupta. An3gada was about to be
<>overpowered by Candragupta, and then the following
<>celestial voice was heard: “Candragupta will not die
<>as long as his wife Padma1vati1 is reciting Brahmamantra
<>imparted by Brahma1.” Then Vibhi1s2an2a sent Hanu1ma1n
<>to the women's quarters and as a result of the latter
<>using a ‘Ku1t2atantrayantra’ great confusion and
<>quarrels broke out among the women-folk, and

<NI>Sahasramukha fought S4ri1 Ra1ma single-handed. All
<>tactics of Ra1ma proved to be of no use. Then he

<>was the son of the Vasu Anala and the younger
<>brother of Subrahman2ya and that he had two brothers

<>Prabha1sa are the as2t2avasus. Vaitan2d2a, S4rama, S4a1nta,

<>Dravin2a, Hutahavyavaha, S4is4vara, Pra1n2a and Varun2a

<>were born to the couple. Kuma1ra, son of Agni was born
<>in S4arastamba and he had three brothers called S4a1kha,
<>Vis4a1kha and Naigameya.”
<NI>The following story about the birth of S4a1kha is from
<>Taran3ga 6, La1va1n2akalambaka of Katha1saritsa1gara:
<>Defeated in battle by Ta1raka1sura, Indra decided to
<>have no more fight with him and retired to Mount
<>Maha1meru. Devas and mahars2is sought asylum with
<>Subrahman2ya, who gave them protection. Indra
<>came to know of it and fought with Subrahman2ya
<>feeling that the latter had captured his kingdom. Two
<>sons, S4a1kha and Vis4a1kha were born from the face of
<>Subrahman2ya wounded by the Vajra1yudha of Indra.

<>(Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 9).

<>Devata1s and the souls of his ancestors here will attain
<>the holy world. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 29).

<>called Sam3hanana and Va1gmi1, both of them great in

<HI>S4AKTI I.
<NI>(1) {%General.%} Son of Vasis2t2ha by Arundhati1. He was
<>the first-born among the hundred sons of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Kalma1s2apa1da, the Ra1ks2asa captured and ate S4akti
<>and his pregnant wife Adr2s4yanti1 spent her days in
<>great grief with Vasis2t2ha. Para1s4aramuni, father of
<>Vya1sa, was Adr2s4yanti1's son. (For details see under

<NI>2) {%Other information%}
<NI>(i) It was S4iva, who incarnated himself as the son of

<HI>S4AKTI II. The weapon of Subrahman2ya is called
<>S4akti, and it was made by Vis4vakarman. Vis4vakarman
<>once grilled Su1rya (sun) on his machine and reduced
<>his glow. The glow thus released by Vis4vakarman fell
<>on the earth and Vis4vakarman made with that glow
<>the cakra (disc) of Vis2n2u, the tris4u1la (trident) of Siva
<>the Pus2paka, aerial chariot of Kubera and the S4akti of
<>Subrahman2ya. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<HI>S4AKTI III. The sound ‘S4’ means welfare or prosperity
<>and ‘kti’ prowess. Therefore S4akti means she, who is
<>the embodiment of prosperity and prowess or she, who
<>grants prosperity and prowess. The definition of
<>‘Bhagavati1’ is, she who combines in herself knowledge
<>affluence, wealth, reputation, power and the female
<>organ. Therefore the word ‘S4akti’ may be taken to mean
<>Bhagavati1 and Pa1rvati1, and what are termed as Bhaga-
<>vati1, S4akti, Devi1, Ambika1, Pa1rvati1 etc. are the mani-
<>festations of S4akti, S4iva's spouse. This S4akti exists
<>fractionally in all Devas. When, once upon a time the
<>deva1sura war broke out the S4aktis of Devas like
<>Brahma1 emerged to help Can2d2ika1. The vehicle, orna-
<>ments, weapon etc. of each Deva, his Devi1 also possessed.
<>The S4aktis (Devi1s) of the Devas appeared in the follow-
<>ing manner. Brahma1n2i1, wife of Brahma1, rode on the
<>swan wearing beads around her neck and holding the
<>water-vessel in her hands. She was followed by Vais2n2avi1
<>Vis2n2u's S4akti on Garud2a wearing yellow clothes and
<>with the conch, disc, lotus etc. in her hands. S4a1n3kari1
<>S4iva's S4akti rode on the ox with the crescent moon and
<>serpents as ornaments and holding in her hands the
<>S4u1la. ‘Kauma1ri1’, Subrahman2ya's S4akti rode on
<>Aira1vata with s4u1la in hands. The S4akti called ‘Va1ra1hi1
<>in the form of a great boar rode carrying a corpse,
<>Na1rasim3hi1’ S4akti took the form of narasim3ha (half man
<>and half lion). Ya1mya1, Yama's s4akti, rode on
<>buffalo holding in her hands a long stick. S4aktis
<>called Kauberi1 and Va1run2i1 took their respective forms
<>and in this manner all the S4aktis came to the help
<>of Devi1. This sight pleased not only the Devas, but
<>the mother of the universe also. Along with them in-
<>carnated on earth S4am3kara, who gives ‘s4am3’ (happiness)
<>to the world and blessed Can2d2ika1 on the battle-field
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th and 9th Skandhas).
<HI>S4AKTIBHADRA. A dramatist in Sanskrit, who lived
<>in the seventh century A.D. He belonged to Cheng-
<>annur in the Kerala State. He was a disciple of
<>S4an3kara1ca1rya. The Dramatic composition ‘A1s4carya-
<>cu1d2a1man2i’ is his work.
<NI>S4aktibhadra, after writing his drama, once read it out
<>to S4an3kara1ca1rya. As the a1ca1rya was observing silence
<>that day, he made no comments about the drama.
<>Disappointed at this silence of his Guru, the drama-
<>tist burnt his work to ashes in fire. When his observ-
<>ance of silence was over, the Guru asked his disciple
<>for the drama. When told about the burning of the
<>drama the a1ca1rya repeated from memory the whole
<>drama. The above legend is widely prevalent in
<>Kerala.
<HI>S4AKUNA(OMENS).
<NI>1) {%General.%} In ancient times people in all countries used
<>to consider S4akunas to be harbingers of good or evil things.
<>Today also many people believe in omens. In India [Page669-a+ 65]
<>S4akuna had developed as a science even in olden days.
<>A general description about omens, good and bad,
<>according to the Indian concept, is given below.
<NI>Mixed medicines, black grains, cotton, grass, dried cow-
<>dung, charcoal, molasses, one whose head is shaven clean
<>or whose body is smeared with oil or who is naked; flesh-
<>eater; iron, dirt, skin, hair of the head, insane person,
<>eunuch, prison, guard; women, who are either carrying
<>or are widows; oil cake, paddy husk, ashes, skull, bone,
<>broken vessel etc. are evil omens. Broken, fierce or mur-
<>muring instrumental music also is a bad omen.
<NI>It is a good omen to hear the voice of beckoning (come)
<>in front of the traveller, but it is not good if the voice is
<>heard from behind. It is good if the voice of farewell (go)
<>is heard from behind, but is bad to be heard in the front.
<>Disapproving or prohibitive words like “Where are you
<>going, stop, don't go”, “what is to be done by going
<>there?” etc. will cause death. It is a bad omen to see
<>carnivorous birds perched on the top of flag-staff etc.
<>For vehicles to bump, weapons to break and head to
<>get wounded by dashing against doors etc. as also for
<>umbrella or clothes to fall down are ill omens. Praising
<>or worshipping Vis2n2u will do away with the inauspicious
<>results of ill omens. But, if evil omens are seen conti-
<>nuously the traveller should return home.
<NI>White flowers are good omens. Full pots are the best
<>of omens. Flesh, fish, sound from afar, old man, soli-
<>tary man, cow, goat, ox, horse, elephant, devas, burning
<>fire, Du1rva1 grass, fresh cow-dung, prostitute, gold,
<>silver, gems, Orris root, mustard, medicinal herbs rooted
<>out of soil, Bengal gram, weapon, sword, stool, royal
<>symbols, dead body being carried without lamentation,
<>fruits, ghee, curdled milk, milk, aks2ata, mirror, honey,
<>conch, sugarcane, auspicious words, music by devotees,
<>loud thunder and lightning are auspicious omens.
<NI>2) {%Two kinds of omens.%} Omens are divided into two varie-
<>ties, di1pta (glowing) and s4a1nta (quiescent, mild). Glow-
<>ing omens bring about auspicious results and the other in-
<>auspicious results. There are six ways or elements, which
<>make omens di1ptam, i.e. vela1 (time), dik (region), des4a
<>(place), Karan2a (action), ruta (cry) and ja1ti (kind). The
<>power or effect of di1pta increases in ascending order.
<NI>To see creatures, which move about during day time as
<>moving about during night and vice-versa is vela1di1pta.
<>In the case of stars, lagnas (the dominant zodiac) and
<>planets, those which are virulent are considered to
<>be di1ptas. With regard to stars and lagnas, those
<>which the Sun enters into are dhu1mita, those where-
<>in the Sun is already present are jvalita and those from
<>which the sun has left are Am3 arin2i1. These three are
<>di1ptas and the rest s4a1ntas. (This is called vela1di1pta).
<>When dik (region) is di1pta it is called digdi1pta.
<>To see forest animals in village and village-animals in
<>forest is digdi1pta. To see good brahmins at inauspi-
<>cious places is des4adi1pta. To see some one doing work
<>not ordained to his caste is karan2adi1pta. To hear differ-
<>ent horrible voices is rutadi1pta. To see purely flesh-
<>eating animals is ja1tidi1pta. If all the characteristics of
<>di1pta do not synchronise but differ from one another it
<>is called s4a1nta and if the characteristics of di1pta and
<>s4a1nta are mixed up it is called mis4ra.
<NI>3) {%Birds, animals etc.%} If the ca1s2a bird (wild crow) makes
<>sound when the king gets out of the palace, he will meet
<>with dishonour. If the sound is heard on the left side,
<>there will be quarrel, but food will be served. If the [Page669-b+ 65]
<>bird is sighted on the right side at the start of the
<>journey, it is a good omen. If the peacock makes differ-
<>ent sounds, threats from thieves will result. If a deer
<>is seen in front of the king going out on a journey, death
<>will happen to him. To see the monkey-bear, rat, tiger,
<>lion, cat and donkey coming in the opposite direction
<>also will bring about death. Donkey braying in awkward
<>notes is also inauspicious. To see kapin5jala bird on the
<>left side is an excellent omen; on the right side also it is
<>not bad. But, behind the person, it is a bad omen.
<>Tittiri bird also on the rear is not good.
<NI>It is always a good omen if the deer, boar and spotted
<>deer cross the path from the left to the right side; the
<>opposite of it is bad omen. It is a favourable omen if the
<>ox, horse, jackal, tiger, lion, cat and donkey pass from
<>the right to the left side. It is auspicious to see the
<>females of the jackal etc. on the right side and the
<>males on the left. To hear the serpent, hare, boar and
<>wild lizard named is good, but to see them is not so.
<>Contrary to this is the effect to see the monkey, ox etc.
<>The result of the important and powerful omens witness-
<>ed at the start of the journey will be experienced the
<>very same day. The omen of the intoxicated, those
<>craving for food, children, people quarrelling and those
<>who stand away from the limits of the road is effectless.
<>To hear the jackal howl once, twice, thrice or four
<>times is a good omen, but to hear it five or six times
<>is bad, The seventh time is good.
<NI>If heard for more than the seventh time it will have no
<>effect. Di1pta omen facing the Sun will horripilate
<>men, cause fear in the case of vehicles and is to
<>be greatly feared. If sa1ran3ga (lotus, deer, elephant,
<>peacock, cuckoo, lion, horse etc.) is met as the first
<>thing in an auspicious place its good effect will last for
<>one year, and if these are met at the inauspicious place,
<>the result will be bad. Everybody should see sa1ran3ga
<>at some auspicious place every dawn.
<NI>If the crow is found crowing in fear on the left side of
<>camps put up for the army of the King, the head of
<>the army will have to face great threats. If the crow,
<>perches on and pecks on the shadow, vehicle, slippers,
<>umbrella, clothes etc. the owner of those things will
<>die. If they are respected by the crow, honour will
<>accrue to their owner. If the crow flies about the
<>entrance of the house it means that he, who had left
<>the house will return. If the crows bring and scatter
<>red coloured and baked things in the courtyard, the
<>owner of the house will meet with imprisonment. If
<>the crow carries to a house something yellow in colour,
<>gold or silver, the owner of the house will get such
<>things. Whatever thing the crow carries away from the
<>house, such things therein will be destroyed. If the
<>crow vomits raw flesh in the rear of the house, the
<>owner of it will come into possession of wealth; if soil is
<>deposited thus, land will be acquired. If gem is
<>deposited, extensive lands will come to the owner of
<>the house. If the crow flies in the same direction as the
<>one chosen by the traveller, prosperity and success
<>will result to him and if it flies in the opposite direction
<>not only will the traveller not achieve his object but,
<>he will also meet with danger. If the crows come crowing
<>against one starting on a journey, it will be hindered.
<>To see the crow on the left side is a good omen. If it
<>is seen on the right side, the journey will not end in
<>success. It is very good if the crow flies in the same [Page670-a+ 64]
<>direction as the traveller on his left side, if on
<>the right side the result will be of medium nature. If
<>it flies in the opposite direction on the left side the tra-
<>veller will face hindrance. If the crow flies into the
<>house when one is about to start on the journey, it
<>means the journey may be begun. The crow which
<>looks at the sun with one eye and perched on one leg
<>is surely indicative of fear for the traveller. If it is in
<>the hollow of a tree great calamities will happen. To
<>dream of crow with its mouth full of excretion is indi-
<>cative of all-round success.
<NI>If the dog enters and barks in the house the result will be
<>sure death of the owner of the house. But, if the dog
<>smells on the left side of the man it is good, and if it
<>smells on the right side, it is bad. If the dogs come
<>against the person about to start on a journey, it will
<>cause hindrance to him. If the dog stands blocking his
<>path there will be threat from thieves. If it comes fac-
<>ing him with a piece of bone in its mouth, he will fail
<>to achieve the object of his travel; if it comes biting a
<>cord, the same will be the result. It is auspicious to see
<>dog, which carries a slipper in its mouth or the mouth
<>of which is filled with flesh. Fear will overtake him in
<>front of whom the dog urinates and goes away. But if
<>not a bitch and if, after urination, it goes to an auspi-
<>cious place, to the shade of an auspicious tree or to-
<>wards an auspicious thing, then it is a good omen. The
<>same considerations are valid in the case of the jackal
<>etc.
<NI>If cows cry without cause or reason, it indicates ruin
<>to the master. If the cry is in an awkward tone, death
<>will result. If the ox murmurs during night, it is good
<>for the master. Ox tied to a cord also is good omen.
<>If cows are found to treat their calves without love, it
<>spells ruin for pregnant women. It is a good omen to
<>see cows which have got wet and whose horns are smeared
<>with earth. These considerations apply to buffaloes as
<>well.
<NI>If elephants indulge in the sexual act in villages, it
<>augurs ill to the villages. If the she-elephant delivers
<>or gets mad in the country, i.e. not in the forest, it
<>spells ruin to king. Ruin to the King will be the result if
<>the elephant objects to his mounting it or runs back
<>home or if the mad elephant is found without madness.
<>It is an auspicious omen if the elephant places its right
<>foot on the left foot of it and also if it holds its tusk
<>with its trunk.
<HI>S4AKUNI I. A serpent born in the Dhr2tara1s2t2ra dynasty.
<>It was burnt to death at the serpent yajn5a conducted

<HI>S4AKUNI VI. The notorious uncle of Duryodhana. Son
<>of King Subala of Ga1ndha1ra and brother of Ga1ndha1ri1.
<>S4akuni, staying at Hastina1pura, pulled the strings for
<>all the evil actions of Duryodhana. It was S4akuni's
<>hands, which worked in the background in driving the
<>Pa1n2d2avas out of the kingdom and in denuding Pa1n5ca1li1
<>of her clothes. It was also his evil tactics, which tore
<>asunder all chances of conciliation with the Pa1n2d2avas
<>on their return from the forest and thus led to the great
<>war that lasted for eighteen days. At last he was killed
<>by Sahadeva during the war. (S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>28, Verse 61). A resume of the part played by S4akuni
<>in the Bha1rata story is given below:

<>laka, Saubaleya, Subalaja and Subalaputra.
<HI>S4A1KUNI. A mahars2i, who lived in Madhu forest. Of
<>the nine sons of S4a1kuni, Dhruva, S4i1la, Budha and Ta1ra

<>offerings in fire). (Padma Pura1n2a, Svarga Khan2d2a 81).
<HI>S4AKUNIGRAHA. Vinata1, in her fierce attitude or

<HI>S4AKUNTALA1. Foster-daughter of sage Kan2va.
<NI>1) Birth. S4akuntala1 was a daughter born to Vis4va1-
<>mitra of the Apsara1 woman called Menaka1. Vis4va1mitra
<>was engaged in intense tapas on the banks of river
<>Ma1lini1 in the Hima1layas. Indra deputed Menaka1 to
<>break the mahars2i's tapas. She enticed him away from [Page671-b+ 65]
<>his tapas and got pregnant by him. But she forsook
<>the child on the banks of Ma1lini1 and returned to
<>Devaloka.
<NI>2) Childhood. Birds gathered round the forsaken
<>orphan-child. While S4akuntas i.e. birds were petting the
<>child Kan2va came that way, saw the child and took it
<>with him to the a1s4rama. As s4akuntas had petted it, the
<>child was named S4akuntala1.
<NI>3) {%As queen.%} King Dus2yanta of the lunar dynasty
<>married S4akuntala1 and to the couple was born the
<>famous Bharata. This is the original story about
<>S4akuntala1's married life. All the Indian languages
<>contain two different versions of S4akuntala1's life. One
<>version is that related in Vya1sa's Bha1rata and the second
<>is that contained in Ka1lida1sa's S4a1kuntala. Many scho-
<>lars opine that in the matter of the S4akuntala1 episode
<>Ka1lida1sa has gone a step further and for the better, and
<>therefore both the versions of the story are to be care-
<>fully studied by us.
<NI>(i) {%Vya1sa's S4akuntala1.%} S4akuntala1, now grown up as a
<>maiden, was alone in the a1s4rama when King Dus2yanta,
<>out in the forest on a hunting expedition, came there.
<>In the absence of her foster-father Kan2va, S4akuntala1
<>welcomed the King. They fell in love with each other
<>and the King married S4akuntala1 according to the
<>Ga1ndharva way of marriage and lived with her for a
<>few days. S4akuntala1 became pregnant. The King
<>returned to his palace.
<NI>Kan2va returned to the a1s4rama and he was pleased that
<>what had been destined to take place had happened.
<>In due course of time S4akuntala1 delivered a boy, who
<>was named Sarvadamana. When the child was grown
<>up, Kan2va sent his mother along with him to Dus2-
<>yanta's palace. The King did not recognise them, but
<>a celestial voice convinced him that the child was his
<>own son. The King heartily welcomed his wife and
<>son and S4akuntala1 lived in the palace as his honoured
<>wife.
<NI>(ii) {%Ka1lida1sa's S4akuntala1.%} Kan2va brought up S4akuntala1
<>born to Vis4va1mitra of Menaka1 in his a1s4rama and she
<>had two companions called Anasu1ya1 and Priyam3vada1.
<>All the three grew up and became maidens.
<NI>King Dus2yanta, who went out hunting in the forest
<>followed a deer to Kan2va's a1s4rama where he saw
<>S4akuntala1 watering the garden with her companions.
<>Kan2va was then away at Cakrati1rtha. Dus2yanta, who
<>fell in love with S4akuntala1, married her according to
<>the Ga1ndharva rules and lived with her at the a1s4rama
<>for a few days. Meanwhile S4akuntala1 became preg-
<>nant, and emissaries from the palace came and the
<>King returned with them. He left the a1s4rama after
<>promising S4akuntala1 that he would soon return to
<>her. He gave her his signet ring.
<NI>Sad over the separation from Dus2yanta and immersed
<>in thought about him, S4akuntala1 was sitting there in the
<>a1s4rama when Durva1sas came there. She did not see
<>the mahars2i nor welcome him respectfully. He got
<>angry at this and cursed her that she be forgotten by
<>him about whom she was so intensely thinking. S4akun-
<>tala1 did not hear the curse either, but her companions
<>who heard it begged pardon of the muni on behalf
<>of S4akuntala1 and prayed for absolution from the curse.
<>Then he said that if S4akuntala1 showed the King any
<>sign about their relationship the King would remember
<>her. Her companions did not tell S4akuntala1 about the [Page672-a+ 64]
<>above incidents. Kan2va gladly welcomed S4akuntala1's
<>wedding with Dus2yanta.
<NI>Days and months passed by, yet Dus2yanta did not
<>return and Kan2va sent S4akuntala1, in whom signs of
<>pregnancy had become prominent, to the palace of the
<>King in the company of Gautami1 and S4a1rn3garava.
<>Anasu1ya1 reminded S4akuntala1 to take particular care
<>of the signet ring. On their way to the palace
<>S4akuntala1 and others bathed in the Somava1rati1rtha, and
<>nobody noticed S4akuntala1 losing from her finger the
<>ring in the ti1rtha. They reached the King's palace.
<>None noticed them. Dus2yanta did not remember
<>having even seen her. The signet ring was missing.
<>After leaving S4akuntala1 at the palace her companions
<>returned to the a1s4rama. Menaka1, whose heart melted
<>at the pathetic wailings of S4akuntala1 led her to
<>Kas4yapa's a1s4rama, left her there and returned to
<>Devaloka.
<NI>The signet ring lost by S4akuntala1 was swallowed by a
<>fish, which was netted by a fisherman, who went about
<>the streets to sell the ring extracted from inside the
<>fish. Servants of the King took the fisherman captive.
<>At the sight of the ring thoughts about the past dawn-
<>ed on the King and he remembered all about S4akuntala1.
<>His days became sad pondering over separation from
<>S4akuntala1.
<NI>S4akuntala1 delivered a boy at the a1s4rama of Kas4yapa.
<>The child was named Sarvadamana and he grew up
<>as a courageous boy.
<NI>On his return from the deva1sura war, Dus2yanta entered
<>Kas4yapa's a1s4rama where he saw Sarvadamana counting
<>the teeth of a lion he had captured. Having heard
<>details about him from the boy the King went inside
<>the a1s4rama and saw Kas4yapa and S4akuntala1. He
<>returned with S4akuntala1 and the boy to the palace
<>with Kas4yapa's blessings. It was this boy Sarva-
<>damana, who afterwards became Bharata, the famous
<>emperor of India.
<HI>S4ALA I. One of the three pugilists deputed by
<>Kam3sa to attack Kr2s2n2a at Mathura1, the other two
<>being Ca1n2u1ra and Mus2t2ika. Kr2s2n2a kicked S4ala to
<>death. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).

<>burnt to death at the serpent yajn5a of Janamejaya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 5)

<>dynasty. He had a brother called Bhu1ris4ravas.
<NI>(1) S4ala was present at the wedding of Draupadi1.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 15).
<NI>(2) He was present at Yudhis2t2hira's Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a.
<>(Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 8).
<NI>(3) He was a fierce warrior in Duryodhana's army.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 55, Verse 68).
<NI>(4) He fought from the southern wing of the great

<HI>S4ALA V. Son of King Pari1ks2it of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<>Sus4obhana1, daughter of the Man2d2u1ka King was his
<>mother. He had two brothers called Dala and Bala.
<>S4ala did not return some horses, which he had taken

<HI>S4ALABHA II. A warrior, who fought against the
<>Kauravas on the Pa1n2d2ava side. He was killed by
<>Karn2a. (Karn2a Parva, Chapter 56, Verse 49).
<HI>S4ALABHA1. Wife of Atrimahars2i. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>3, 8; 74-78).
<HI>S4ALABHI1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 26).
<HI>SA1LAGRA1MA. A stone emblem of Vis2n2u.
<NI>1) {%Origin of the name.%} Sa1lagra1ma is the kind of
<>ammonite, used for making the image of Vis2n2u.
<>Maha1vis2n2u is known by the name Sa1lagra1ma also.
<>This name originated from the name Sa1lagra1ma,
<>which is the name of the place from where the river
<>Gan2d2aki1, which flows through Nepal, starts. This
<>Sa1lagra1ma is considered to be a holy place. Maha1vis2n2u
<>and other gods always dwell in this place. Sa1lagra1ma
<>is the name of Vis2n2u who dwells in Sa1lagra1ma. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanzas 123 to 125).
<NI>2) {%The importance of Sa1lagra1ma.%} The place Sa1lagra1ma
<>is at the origin of river Gan2d2aki1. There are various
<>kinds of stone figures which are called Sa1lagra1mas.
<>These Sa1lagra1mas themselves have orginated from
<>portions of Vis2n2u. That is why those stones are used
<>for making images of Vis2n2u. There is a story in the
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, stating that the derivation
<>of these stones is from a portion of Vis2n2u.
<NI>During the early days, Sarasvati1, Laks2mi1 and Gan3ga1
<>were wives of Maha1vis2n2u. One day there arose a family
<>quarrel among them. (See under Tulasi1). As a result
<>of this quarrel, the Devi1s cursed each other. Sarasvati1
<>cursed Laks2mi1 and changed her to holy basil plant
<>(Tulasi1) on the earth. When Laks2mi1 was about to
<>depart as Tulasi1, Maha1vis2n2u blessed her thus. “Look!
<>Laks2mi1! you will live in the world as a holy basil and
<>when the curse has been completed you will come back
<>to me. On that day, a river named Gan2d2aki1, will start
<>from your body which will be in the shape of the holy
<>basil plant. (It is also said that the river Gan2d2aki1
<>has taken birth from the sweat of S4iva and Vis2n2u.
<>Refer to the word Gan2d2aki1). On the bank of that
<>river, I will remain as a stone image. There will be so
<>many worms with strong tusks and teeth, which will pierce
<>the stone into the shape of Sudars4ana cakra (the weapon
<>of Vis2n2u) and will create numberless Sa1lagra1mas. The
<>Sa1lagra1mas thus made, will be of various sizes and
<>shapes.”
<NI>3) {%Different classes of Sa1lagra1mas.%} Mention is made in
<>the Pura1n2as about nineteen classes of Sa1lagra1mas. They
<>are given below: [Page673-a+ 65]
<NI>(i) {%Laks2mi1na1ra1yan2a.%} With one hole, four cakras
<>(wheels) and Vanama1la1 (a line like the garland) and
<>of the colour of clouds.
<NI>(ii) {%Laks2mi1jana1rdana.%} This is the same as Laks2mi1na1ra1-
<>yan2a, with the difference that there will be no
<>Vanama1la1.
<NI>(iii) {%Raghuna1tha.%} With two holes and four wheels and
<>mark of the hoof of a calf. This also will have no
<>Vanama1la1.
<NI>(iv) {%Va1mana.%} With two very small wheels and
<>the colour of the cloud. This too will have no
<>Vanama1la1.
<NI>(v) {%S4ri1dhara.%} This is the same as Va1mana with the
<>exception that it will be having Vanama1la1. The house
<>in which this is placed will have a prosperity and well
<>being of its own.
<NI>(vi) {%Da1modara.%} Will be large and round with two
<>cakras (wheels) and with no Vanama1la1.
<NI>(vii) {%Ran2ara1ma.%} Neither too large nor too small, but of
<>medium size and round, with two wheels and the
<>marks of child's kick, bow and quiver.
<NI>(viii) {%Ra1jara1jes4vara.%} Of the size of Ran2ara1ma with
<>seven cakras, (wheels), ornamented with the mark of
<>umbrella. This will earn for the possessor kingly
<>wealth.
<NI>(ix) {%Ananta.%} Somewhat thick with fourteen wheels,
<>and as black as a cloud. This Sa1lagra1ma will give men
<>the four Purus2a1rthas (objects of life) ‘Dharma1rtha-
<>ka1rnamoks2a’ (Duty, wealth, desire and salvation).
<NI>(x) {%Madhusu1dana.%} A sa1lagra1ma in the shape of a wheel
<>with two wheels, and impression of cow's hoof,
<>having the shade of cloud, of ordinary size. This will
<>be very bright.
<NI>(xi) {%Sudars4ana.%} Sudars4ana will have only one cakra
<>(wheel).
<NI>(xii) {%Gada1dhara.%} This also will be having only one
<>wheel which will not be bright.
<NI>(xiii) {%Hayagri1va.%} This will have two wheels and the face
<>of a horse.
<NI>(xiv) {%Na1rasim3ha.%} With a very wide mouth, two wheels,
<>and awful shape. This Sa1lagra1ma will cause instant
<>self-renunciation.
<NI>(xv) {%Laks2mi1narasim3ha.%} This also will be having a wide
<>mouth and two wheels. Besides these, there will be the
<>Vanama1la1 also. This will make house-holders cosy
<>and comfortable.
<NI>(xvi) {%Va1sudeva.%} The Sa1lagra1ma with two wheels at
<>the region of the hole and with round shape having
<>vividness and brightness, is Va1sudeva. This will grant
<>all desires.
<NI>(xvii) {%Pradyumna.%} This will have only a minute wheel.
<>The colour will be that of clouds. But on the outer
<>side, there will be a hole in the inside of which there
<>will be a number of cuts or dents. This will give house-
<>holders comfort always.
<NI>(xviii) {%San3kars2an2a.%} In the San3kars2an2a two wheels
<>will be joined face to face. The fore-part will be thin-
<>ner than the hind-part. This also will do good to
<>house-holders.
<NI>(xix) {%Aniruddha.%} The colour of this is yellow. This
<>will be quite round and bright. This also will give
<>comfort to the house-holder. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9; Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 46).
<NI>4). {%The greatness of Sa1lagra1ma.%} Of these, the stones
<>with cakras (the weapon Discus), are Bhagava1n Vis2n2u [Page673-b+ 64]
<>in reality. Those who worship this stone with mark of
<>cakra, need not have to take another birth. He who
<>habitually worships Sa1lagra1ma, should avoid arro-
<>gance and should be charitable. He who worships
<>Sa1lagra1ma with the mark of wheel should not covet
<>others' wealth and women. The cakra from Dva1raka1
<>and the stone from Gan2d2aki1 will bring atonement in
<>a moment for sins incurred in a hundred births. Even
<>if one has incurred thousands of sins, one will get remis-
<>sion for all of them by drinking the water of Sa1lagra1ma.
<>Bra1hman2a, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra will attain
<>heaven if they become house-holders according to
<>Vedic convention and worship Sa1lagra1ma. On no
<>account should women worship Sa1lagra1ma. If by
<>ignorance, a woman, whether she is good-natured or of
<>a higher status, happens to touch Sa1lagra1ma, all her
<>merits earned by good deeds will be lost and she will
<>go to hell. Brahmin sages say that women throwing
<>flowers as oblation on Sa1lagra1ma, commit the greatest
<>sin. If a woman touches a Sa1lagra1ma, the offering of
<>Sandal-wood will be like poisoned rice, flowers like
<>diamond, and meals presented to god before being
<>eaten by the servants in the temple, will be like Ka1la-
<>ku1t2a (the poison of Va1suki), to Bhagava1n Vis2n2u. If
<>a woman touches Sa1lagra1ma, she will have to remain
<>in hell for the duration of fourteen Indras. Even the
<>sin of Brahmahatya1 (killing a brahmin) will be remit-
<>ted by drinking the water of Sa1lagra1ma and he will
<>attain heaven. Basil (tulasi1) sandalwood, water, conch
<>tinkling bell, wheel, stone, copper pot, and name of
<>Vis2n2u comprise ‘Pada1mr2ta’ (the celestial nectar of
<>words) which is said to have the power of remit-
<>ting sins. The merits obtained by bathing in all
<>the ti1rthas and the performing of all the ya1gas (sacri-
<>fices) dwell in each drop of water of Sa1lagra1ma.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 20).
<HI>S4ALA1KA1. Wife of mahars2i Dhanan5jaya, who belonged

<HI>S4A1LIHOTRA. A muni of ancient days. Vya1sa had once
<>lived in his a1s4rama. There was a tree near the a1s4rama
<>which had outlived time. A drink of the water in the
<>pond here quenches hunger and thirst. The tree and the
<>pond were created by the power of S4a1lihotra's tapas.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas, during their life in exile in the forest,
<>visited this place in the company of Hid2imbi1 and
<>quenched their hunger and thirst by drinking water
<>from this pond. (M.B., Southern text, Chapter 154). [Page674-a+ 65]
<>S4a1lihotra was an adept in as4vasastra (science about
<>horses). To bathe in the ti1rtha called S4a1lisu1rya creat-
<>ed by the muni is to derive the same result as that of
<>making a gift of a thousand cows. (Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 71, Verse 27 and Chapter 83, Verse 107).
<HI>S4A1LIKA. A divine mahars2i. He met Kr2s2n2a once on

<>83).
<HI>S4A1LIPIN2D2A. A na1ga born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his

<>pati by his wife Muni. He participated in the birthday
<>celebrations of Arjuna. (Adi Parva, Chapter 65,
<>Verse 4).
<HI>S4A1LISU1RYA. A holy spot in Kuruks2etra. It is said to
<>have been the place where muni S4a1lihotra lived. To
<>bathe at this place is to derive the same result as that
<>of making a gift of a thousand cows. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Verse 10).
<HI>S4A1LMALI. A King of the lunar dynasty. He was the
<>grandson of Kuru and son of Aviks2it. He had seven
<>brothers. (A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 52).
<HI>S4A1LMALIDVI1PA. One of the seven islands.

<>this, there are also seven rivers there. The seven rivers are
<>Yoni, Toya1, Vitr2n2a1, Candra1, Mukta1, Vimocani1 and
<>Nirvr2ti. Mere remembrance of the seven rivers is
<>sufficient to annihilate all sins. Here people
<>divided into the four classes live. Brahmins, Ks2atriyas
<>Vais4yas and S4u1dras here are called Kapilas, Arun2as,
<>Pi1tas and Kr2s2n2as. These devout people worship Vis2n2u
<>in the form of Va1yu by sublime yajn5as. Devas are ever
<>present on this most beautiful island. A tree named
<>Sa1lmali which gives mental comfort grows in this
<>island. The island is surrounded on all four sides by
<>an ocean of Sura1 (liquor). (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part II,
<>Chapter 4).
<NI>2). {%S4a1lmali island and na1ga1stra.%} See under Na1gastra.
<HI>S4A1LU1KINI1. A sacred place in Kuruks2etra. To bathe

<>83, Verse 13).
<HI>SA1LVA I.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The lover of Amba1 (q.v) the

<HI>SAMA1DHICHET2T2I. A Vais4ya who became learned
<>and abstemious by the grace of Devi1. The story of this
<>Vais4ya, who ran away from the cruel and wicked
<>treatment that he had suffered from his wife and
<>children, and took to spiritual knowledge by the force
<>of circumstances was told to Janamejaya by Vya1sa.
<>After telling several stories about the kind regard of
<>Devi1 towards those who worship her with devotion,
<>Vya1sa continued as follows:--
<NI>During the time of Sva1rocis2a Manu, there lived a
<>King named Suratha. Because of his liberality and
<>truthfulness he had very few enemies. While he was
<>ruling over the kingdom known as Kola1pura, once the
<>low caste people of the mountains fought a battle with
<>the King. Though the army of the low castes was
<>small it was the King who sustained defeat. He
<>returned to the palace thoughtful. He had no peace of
<>mind. So he went to the forest to get peace. After
<>travelling for a long time on horse-back, he reached the
<>hermitage of the sage Sumedhas. Forgetting himself
<>in the peaceful stillness of the hermitage, the King got
<>down from the horse and sat under a tree. The hermit
<>Sumedhas came there and talked with the King.
<>The King told his story to the hermit, who invited the
<>King to live with him. Thus the King lived in the
<>hermitage eating fruits, roots etc.
<NI>The King found it difficult to reconcile himself with
<>the purity and simplicity of the hermit's surroundings.
<>He always thought of his wife and children. He was
<>troubled in mind by thinking that the money kept in
<>the treasury would be wasted by others. Thus thinking
<>about many things, with a troubled mind, the King
<>was sitting under a tree near the hermitage once when
<>he saw another man coming towards him, with a
<>troubled mind like himself. They talked with each
<>other. The new-comer said to the King “I am a
<>Vais4ya. My name is Sama1dhicet2t2i. My wife and
<>children love wealth. They want to take possession of
<>my wealth and to waste it. But I was against it. I did
<>not favour unnecessary expenditure. They resolved to
<>remove the obstacle from their path, and began to
<>make preparation for it secretly. I understood it and
<>fearing death I ran away from the house.”
<NI>As soon as the king heard this story he said his own
<>story to the Vais4ya. The Vais4ya continued. “Oh!
<>Still, my mind is troubled. I am worried about my
<>wife and children. They will be put to much difficulty
<>if I am not there to look after them. Who is there to
<>support them without me? All the children are lean.
<>My wife also is likewise, lean. They are all always
<>ill. What will they do without me? While I think of
<>all these things I have no peace of mind at all.”
<NI>Suratha: “What a fool are you! You yourself have
<>said that all your children are wicked and cruel.
<>Moreover they and their mother joining together had [Page676-b+ 64]
<>been trying to murder you. Why do you feel so
<>miserable about such a wife and children?”
<NI>When the King had finished saying thus much,
<>Sumedhas came there. To remove the darkness of
<>illusion from their minds, the hermit taught them the
<>Nine-lettered Mantra (spell) with prayer and medi-
<>tation. Thus giving them the mantra, the teacher
<>hermit advised them to go to the bank of the river and
<>select a suitable place and worship Devi1 with devotion
<>and concentration of mind. Accordingly they went to
<>the bank of the river and selected a pure and solitary
<>place, and concentrating their minds on Devi1, began
<>to meditate and worship her taking only very little
<>food. Thus engaged in deep meditation they spent two
<>years. One day in a dream Devi1 appeared to them.
<>She was clad in red clothes, and wore beautiful
<>ornaments. They were full of joy on seeing the goddess.
<>The third year of the penance was over. But Devi1 did
<>not appear directly before them. In the third year
<>they took only water. They finished the fourth year
<>without seeing the goddess. They decided to do severe
<>penance. Their intention was to offer their bodies to
<>Devi1. So they made a triangular cavity, with three
<>parts each having an extension of 1½ ft. and made
<>the walls of the cavity firm and kindled a large fire in
<>it. The King and the Vais4ya began to cut pieces of
<>flesh from their bodies and offered to Devi1 in the
<>fire, and with the blood coming from the body they
<>performed sacrifice to Devi1. Instantly Devi1 appeared
<>before them and asked them what boon they wanted.
<>The King wanted to get his kingdom back. Devi1
<>said. “You return home. Your enemies shall leave the
<>kingdom. Your ministers will fall at your feet and beg
<>your pardon. You can rule over your country for ten
<>thousand years. After that you will take rebirth as
<>Sa1varn2i Manu, the son of the Sun.”
<NI>What Sama1dhi Cet2t2i wished was a life of self-renun-
<>ciation. Devi1 gave him the wisdom and knowledge to
<>renounce everything he had and to live a life of
<>complete abstinence. Then Devi1 disappeared. The
<>King returned to his kingdom and resumed his rule.
<>Cet2t2i renounced everything and wandered about
<>immersed in meditation on Devi1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 5).

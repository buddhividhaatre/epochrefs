<>{@A@}
<HI>A ({#a#}). The first letter (Vowel) of all Indian languages.
<>According to the Na1na1rtharatnama1la1 this letter has the
<>following meanings:--Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva, tortoise,
<>courtyard, battle, harem, jewellery, sea, Pa1rvati1 and bow-
<>string.
<HI>ABALA is one of the fifteen devas who were the sons of
<>Pa1n5cajanya. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 11).
<HI>ABHAYA was one of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was
<>killed by Bhi1masena. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67,
<>Verse 104; Dron2a Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 62).
<HI>ABHAYAM. King Idhmajihva divided his kingdom
<>Plaks2advi1pa into seven parts and gave them to his
<>seven sons. Abhayam is one of the parts. The other six
<>parts are:--S4ivam3, Yamasam3, Subhadram3, S4a1ntam3,
<>Ks2emam3 and Amr2tam3. See “Idhmajihva”. (Bha1gavata,
<>5th Skandha, Chapter 20, Verse 2). It is seen (from
<>M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30, Verse 9) that the
<>territory known as Abhayam was conquered by
<>Bhi1masena. (See Foot-note)
<HI>ABHIBHU. He was a King, the son of the King of Ka1s4i1
<>and a relative of the Pa1n2d2avas. He was killed by the
<>son of King Vasuda1na. He had a most wonderful
<>horse. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 151, Verse 63;
<>Karn2a Parva, Chapter 6, Verses 23-24; Dron2a Parva,
<>Verses 26-27).
<HI>ABHIMANYU I. He was the heroic son of Arjuna the cen-
<>tral figure of the Maha1bha1rata, by his wife Subhadra1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} He was descended from Vis2n2u in this order:
<>Brahma1-Atri-Candra-Budha-Puru1ravas-A1yus-Nahus2a-

<>S4antanu-Vya1sa-Pa1n2d2u-Arjuna-Abhimanyu.
<NI>2) {%Pu1rvajanma (Previous Birth).%} There is a story about
<>Abhimanyu's Pu1rvajanma in the Maha1bha1rata. It was
<>Varcas, son of Candra, who incarnated as Abhimanyu,
<>son of Arjuna. A conference took place between the
<>Devas and Candra about the incarnation of the Devas
<>in the world for the destruction of the wicked people.
<>Candra told the Devas: “I do not like to send Varcas,
<>whom I love more than my life, to the earth. Still, I
<>think it is not right to stand in the way of the plans of
<>the gods. You must agree to one condition if I am to
<>send my son. Let him be born as the son of Arjuna.
<>I am unable to be separated from him for more than
<>sixteen years. My son will enter into the Cakra Vyu1ha
<>of the enemies to be killed by them and return to me
<>in the sixteenth year.” The devas (gods) accepted this
<>condition. That is why Abhimanyu was killed in his
<>sixteenth year. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67).
<NI>3) {%Military Training and War.%} Abhimanyu received his
<>training in arms from his father Arjuna. Later, he
<>went with his mother Subhadra1 to Dva1raka1 and lived
<>for some time with his uncle S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. There he is
<>said to have received training in arms from Pradyumna,
<>son of S4ri1 Kr2s2na. After the incognito life of the [Page001-b+ 64]
<>Pa1n2d2avas, Abhimanyu married Uttara1, daughter of
<>the King of Vira1ta. War broke out between Kauravas
<>and Pa1n2d2avas. On the first day itself Abhimanyu
<>entered into a duel with Br2hatbala, King of Kosala.
<>In the terrible conflict with Bhi1s2ma, Abhimanyu broke
<>Bhi1s2ma's flagstaff. After that he assisted his father Arjuna
<>to fight against Bhi1s2ma. Verses 8-13 of Chapter 55 of
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva of the Maha1bha1rata describe Abhi-
<>manyu's fight with Laks2man2a in the second day's battle.
<>Then he took his place in the Ardha Candra Vyu1ha
<>(semi-circular phalanx) formed by Arjuna. He fought
<>fiercely with the Gandha1ras. He attacked S4alya and kill-
<>ed Jayatsena, King of Magadha, along with his elephant.
<>We find Abhimanyu assisting Bhi1masena in M.B. Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapters 63, 64, 69 and 94. After that
<>Abhimanyu defeated Laks2man2a in battle. Then he
<>defeated Vikarn2a, Citrasena and others also. Later he
<>took his position in the S4r2n3ga1t2aka Vyu1ha created by
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna. He started fighting with Bhagadatta.
<>He defeated Am3bas2t2ha and Alam3bus2a. Next he fought a
<>duel with Sudi1s2n2a. After that he encountered Duryo-
<>dhana, Br2hatbala and others. M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 10, Verses 47-52 are a description of Abhi-
<>manyu's heroism by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He snatched Paurava's
<>weapon and threw it on the ground. Next he fought
<>with Jayadratha and S4alya. Then he was caught in the
<>Cakra Vyu1ha (circular phalanx) of the enemies.
<>There he inflicted great losses upon the enemy forces.
<>S4alya was stunned and his brother was killed by
<>Abhimanyu. M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 38, Verses 23
<>and 24 describe the flight of the Kauravas in fear. At
<>this stage, even Dron2a1ca1rya praised Abhimanyu's
<>valour. Dus4s4a1sana fainted during his fight with Abhi-
<>manyu. Karn2a was defeated. Vr2s2asena, Satyas4ravas
<>and S4alya's son, Rugmaratha were slain. Duryodhana
<>fled. Laks2man2a was killed. Vr2nda1raka, As4vattha1ma1,
<>Karn2a and others were amazed by this terrible valour
<>of Abhimanyu. Six ministers of Karn2a were slain.
<>Next, As4vaketu, son of the King of Magadha was
<>killed. King Bhoja was also killed. S4alya was again
<>defeated. S4atrun5jaya, Candraketu, Meghavega, Suvarcas,
<>Su1ryabha1sa--who were all kings--were beheaded by
<>Abhimanyu. S4akuni was wounded by Abhimanyu's
<>arrow. Ka1lakeya, son of Subala was slain. M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 40, Verses 13 and 14 say that at this
<>stage, Prince Dus4s4a1sana beat Abhimanyu to death with
<>his mace.
<NI>4) {%After Death.%} M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 71, Verses
<>12-16 say that after death Abhimanyu attained the
<>immortal world of the Munis (Saints). King Pari1ks2it
<>was the son of Abhimanyu. In M.B. Svarga1rohan2a
<>Parva, Chapter 5, Verses 18-20, we find that after his
<>death, Abhimanyu entered the moon in his former form
<>of Varcas.
<NI>5) {%Other names of Abhimanyu.%} In the Maha1bha1rata
<>Abhimanyu has been referred to by several other names,
<>such as A1RJUNI, Saubhadra, Ka1rs2n2i1, Arjuna1tmaja,
<>S4ukra1tmaja1tmaja, Arjuna1para and Pha1lguni.
<NI>6) {%Other details.%} King Pari1ks2it was the son of Abhi-
<>manyu. Janamejaya was born as his son. It was Janame-

<>In the Bha1gavata the number mentioned is seven; but in the Malayalam version of the Bha1gavata (By Ramanujan Eluttacchan)
<>the number is eight. The original Bha1gavata says: “S4ivam3 Yamasam3. Subhadram3, S4a1ntam3, Ks2emam3, Amr2tam3 Abhayam iti
<>Vars2a1ni tes2u girayo nadyas4ca saptaivabhijn5a1ta1h2”. In the Malayalam Bha1gavata an eighth division called S4ivadam3 is seen.</F> [Page002-a+ 63]
<>jaya who performed Sarpasatra. (A ya1ga) S4ata1ni1ka was
<>the son of Janamejaya. S4ata1ni1ka had a son named
<>Sahasra1ni1ka. King Udayana, the jewel of the Candra
<>Vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty) was born to Sahasra1ni1ka by
<>the goddess Mr2ga1vati1 (See ‘Udayana’, stories about
<>this Udayana are very famous. Ka1lida1sa has mentioned
<>in his “Meghadu1ta” about the old rustics who thronged
<>the country-sides to tell and listen to Udayana stories).
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Madana Kan5cukalam3baka, 4th
<>Taran3ga).
<HI>ABHIMANYU II. One of the sons of Manu. The ten
<>sons born to Manu by Nadvala1 were: Kuru, Puru,
<>S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2t2oma,
<>Adhira1tra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Section 1, Chapter 13).
<HI>ABHIMANYU VADHA PARVA. A part (branch) of
<>Dron2a Parva. (See “Maha1bha1rata”).
<HI>ABHINAYA. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 342, Abhinaya
<>has been defined as follows: Abhinaya is the art of
<>presenting before the people the ideas that are to be
<>communicated to them. There are four divisions of
<>this art known as Sa1ttvika, Va1cika, A1n3gika and A1ha1rya
<>depending on Sattva, Va1k, An3ga and A1ha1rya. Besides
<>these, another division known as Abhima1nika (Abhi-
<>ma1nottha) may also be mentioned. This signifies the
<>expression of rasas like S4r2n3ga1ra. There are two kinds
<>of S4r2n3ga1ra known as Sam3bhoga and Vipralambha.
<>Four varieties of Vipralambha called Pu1rva1nura1ga
<>Vipralambha, Ma1na Vipralambha, Prava1sa Vipra-
<>lambha and Karun2a Vipralambha are mentioned. The
<>union after Vipralambha is Sam3bhoga-S4r2n3ga1ra. All
<>Sa1ttvika bha1vas are included in S4r2n3ga1ra. All these have
<>to be expressed through Abhinaya.
<HI>ABHI1RU. A Ra1jars2i who was born of the sixth
<>Ka1lakeya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 53).
<HI>ABHI1S2A1KAM. A Janapada (Village) of ancient India.
<>The warriors of this Janapada were called Abhi1s2a1kas.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 12; Chapter
<>93, Verse 2).
<HI>ABHI1SA1RAM. A Janapada of ancient India. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 94).
<HI>ABHISA1RI1. Arjuna conquered this city, which was
<>one of the ancient cities of India, in the course of
<>his Digvijaya (conquest of the world).
<HI>ABHIS2YANTA. A son born to Maha1ra1ja Kuru by
<>Va1hini1. He had three brothers named Caitraratha,
<>Muni and Janamejaya. Abhis2yanta was the younger
<>brother of As4vava1n and elder brother of Caitraratha.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verses 50-51).
<HI>ACALA I. 1) {%General.%} Acala was the son of Subala, a
<>King of Ga1ndha1ra. He was S4akuni's brother and a
<>heroic Charioteer on the side of the Kauravas. (M.B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 168, Verse 1).
<NI>2) Acala had also taken part in Yudhis2t2hira's Ra1ja-
<>su1ya. (A very expensive sacrifice--ya1ga--performed by
<>an emperor.) (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 7).
<NI>3) Acala had a brother named Vr2s2aka. In the battle
<>between the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas, Arjuna killed
<>Acala and Vr2s2aka. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 30,
<>Verse 11).
<NI>4) One night Vya1sa summoned the departed holy souls
<>and Acala also was among them. (M.B. A1s4va-
<>medhika Parva, Chapter 32, Verse 12). [Page002-b+ 65]
<HI>ACALA II. Name of a bull. Among the pa1rs2adas of
<>Skanda we see the bull named Acala. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 74).
<HI>ACALA III. An epithet of Maha1vis2n2u. Among the
<>thousand names of Maha1vis2n2u we see the name Acala
<>also. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 149, Verse 92).
<HI>ACALA. Subrahman2ya, who was born from S4iva's
<>semen which fell into the fire, was made Commander-
<>in-Chief (Generalissimo) by the gods to kill Ta1raka1sura.
<>A large number of warriors and mothers were
<>assigned to assist him. A woman named Acala1 was in-
<>cluded among those mothers. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 40, Verse 14).
<HI>ACCHODA1. A spiritual daughter of the Pitr2s. (For
<>further details see “Ama1vasu”).
<HI>ACCHODASARAS. A river, who was the daughter of
<>the Pitr2s called Agnis2va1ttas. (Hari Vam3s4a, Chapter 18,
<>Verse 26).
<HI>ACYUTA. (See Vis2n2u).
<HI>ACYUTA1YU. He was a heroic warrior on the Kaurava
<>side. S4ruta1yu was the brother of Acyuta1yu. Both of
<>them were killed by Arjuna in the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava
<>battle. These heroes attacked Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>furiously with their arrows and Arjuna had some
<>difficulty in killing them. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>93, Verses 7-42).
<HI>ACYUTA STHALA. This is an ancient village in
<>India. In ancient times S4u1dras of mixed castes
<>inhabited this region. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>129, Verse 9).
<HI>ADHARMA. A description of the lineage of Adharma
<>is found in Agni Pura1n2a. Him3sa1 (violence) is the
<>consort of Adharma. The couple procreated two
<>children, Anr2ta and Nikr2ti, and from them sprang
<>up Bhaya (fear), Naraka (Hell), Ma1ya1 (illusion),
<>Vedana1 (pain) etc. And, out of them Ma1ya1 brought
<>forth Death, the destroyer of (all) objects. Vedana1, in
<>its turn produced Sorrow and Grief out of Raurava.
<>From Death were born Disease, Senility, Sorrow, Intense
<>desire and Anger. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20).
<HI>ADHARMA. Adharma is a person who is an embodi-
<>ment of Adharmas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 53). Adharma's wife Nirr2ti delivered 3 children;
<>Bhaya, Maha1bhaya and Mr2tyu. Adharma had another
<>son, Darpa (conceit) born of Wealth. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 90, Verse 27).
<HI>ADHAS4S4IRAS I was a great sage. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is said to
<>have met the sage on his way to Hastina1pura. (M.B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 33, Verse 64).
<HI>ADHAS4S4IRAS II. There is a reference in Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a to a hell called Adhas4s4iras. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part
<>2, Chapter 6).
<HI>ADHI1RA. A King; also a great devotee of Lord S4iva.
<>Once he decreed death penalty on an innocent woman.
<>He also destroyed with his own hands a temple of S4iva.
<>As a consequence of those two sinful deeds he became
<>a devil after death. Ultimately by the grace of S4iva
<>he cast off the devil's form and became an attendant of
<>S4iva. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 111).
<HI>ADHIRA1JYA. A Kingdom in ancient India, described
<>in Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 44. Today this place
<>is known as Rewa.
<HI>ADHIRATHA. Foster father of Karn2a.
<NI>1) {%Lineage.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1-Atri-
<>Candra-Puru1ravas-A1yus-Nahus2a-Yaya1ti-Anudruhyu- [Page003-a+ 65]

<>Br2hadratha-Br2hanmanas-Jayadratha-Dhr2tavr2ta-Satya-
<>karma1-Adhiratha-Karn2a (foster son).
<NI>2) {%Foster father of Karn2a.%} Sage Durva1sas had taught
<>Kunti1 some mantras to get children, and Kunti1, then
<>unmarried, tested the first mantra with the Sun-god
<>as her object. The Sun-god appeared before Kunti1
<>and from his power she conceived and duly delivered a
<>child, Karn2a. Fearing obloquy Kunti1 concealed the
<>child in a box and floated it on the river, Ganges. At the
<>time Adhiratha, a great comrade of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came
<>to the river for a bath. His wife was one grieving
<>over not having a child of her own. So, when Adhiratha
<>found a child in the floating box, he took it home,
<>and himself and his wife Ra1dha1 brought up the child
<>with pleasure. The child was named Vasusena, and
<>the child grew up to become the famous Karn2a and
<>favourite friend of Duryodhana. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapters 67 and 130; Vana Parva, Chapter 309;
<>Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 2).
<NI>3) {%Some particulars.%} Adhiratha was King of An3ga. He
<>was a Su1ta (charioteer) and Karn2a grew up as his
<>son. Karn2a was sent to Hastina1pura to be trained
<>in the us2e of weapons, and it was here that Duryo-
<>dhana and Karn2a developed their friendship and
<>alliance. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 147, Verse 3).
<>S4ri1 Maha1devi1bha1gavata, in Chapter 3 relates the
<>following incident: “Thus lamenting Kunti1 sent the
<>box concealing Karn2a, by the nurse, to be floated in
<>the river, and after bath, food etc. she spent the hours
<>in the normal way within the inner apartment. Ra1ja1
<>Adhiratha bathing in the river saw the box floating in
<>the river”. These facts prove that Adhiratha was not
<>only the King of An3ga but a good charioteer as well,
<>and further a very good friend of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>4) We come across Adhiratha on the occasion of the
<>trial of skill in the use of arms between the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. When Karn2a entered the lists
<>the Pa1n2d2avas questioned his nobility of birth. Seeing
<>Karn2a's great humiliation and discomfiture Duryodhana
<>enthroned him immediately as King of An3ga. Vya1sa,
<>who witnessed the scene has given a picturesque des-
<>cription of it.
<HI>ADHOKS2AJA. A synonym of Maha1 Vis2n2u. (Kam3sa1ri-
<>radhoks2ajah2--Amarakos4a).
<HI>ADHRIGU. A great sage (Mahars2i) who lived during
<>the R2gvedic period. (R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka
<>16, Su1kta 112).
<HI>ADHR2S2YA1. A river. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9,
<>Verse 24).
<HI>ADHYAPA1YANA. A disciple of the great preceptor of
<>Atharvaveda, Sumantu. He divided Atharvaveda
<>into two parts and gave one to Utatthya and the other
<>to Vedadars4ana. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 12).
<HI>ADITI. 1) {%Genealogy.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and
<>son of Mari1ci married Aditi, daughter of Daks2apraja1-
<>pati. Aditi had twelve sisters: Diti, Ka1la1, Dana1yus,
<>Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pr2tha1, Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1,
<>Muni and Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Verse 12). Devas are sons born to Kas4yapa by Aditi
<>and hence they are known as A1diteyas also. Kas4yapa
<>married all the thirteen sisters including Aditi, and [Page003-b+ 65]
<>all living beings owe their origin to them. (See Kas4-
<>yapa).
<NI>2) {%Descendants.%} 33 sons were born to Aditi. 12 of them
<>are called Dva1das4a1dityas, viz. Dha1ta1, Aryama1, Mitra,
<>S4akra, Varun2a, Am3s4a, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1, Savita1,
<>Tvas2t2a1 and Vis2n2u. Amongst the other 21 sons are the
<>11 Rudras and 8 Vasus. (See M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65, Verse 15).
<NI>3) {%Main incidents.%} 1. {%How Maha1vis2n2u was born as the
<>son of Aditi.%} The Maha1bha1rata and the Ra1ma1yan2a
<>refer to a story about the birth of Maha1vis2n2u as the
<>son of Aditi. Vis2n2u entered the womb of Aditi as
<>Va1mana (Dwarf). This story was related by the sage
<>Vis4va1mitra to the boys Ra1ma and Laks2man2a while
<>they were accompanying the sage in the forest. When
<>they entered Siddha1s4rama Vis4va1mitra pointed to the
<>latter that the A1s4rama was sacred, because Maha1vis2n2u
<>had stayed there for long as Va1mana. The Devas
<>induced Maha1vis2n2u to obstruct the sacrifice (ya1ga)
<>being performed by Emperor Maha1bali, son of
<>Virocana. At that time Aditi, the wife of Kas4yapa
<>was doing penance so that Maha1vis2n2u might be born
<>as her son, and accordingly he entered her womb.
<>1000 years later she gave birth to Vis2n2u, and that child
<>was known as Va1mana. (See Va1mana; also M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 272, Verse 62, Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 83, Verses 25 and 26, as also Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Canto 29).
<NI>2. {%Rebirth of Aditi.%} Once Kas4yapa made all arrange-
<>ments to perform a sacrifice (ya1ga). Having failed to
<>get the suitable cow for it, he stole Varun2a's cow and
<>conducted the ya1ga. Not only that, Kas4yapa refused
<>to return the cow even after the ya1ga was over.
<>Varun2a in hot anger rushed to Kas4yapa's hermitage.
<>Kas4yapa was absent, and his wives, Aditi and Surasa1
<>did not treat Varun2a with due respect. The enraged
<>Varun2a cursed them to be born in Gokula. He also
<>complained about the matter to Brahma1. Brahma1 told
<>Kas4yapa: “Since you, a learned person, have stolen
<>the cow, may you along with your wives be born in
<>Gokula and tend cows”. Accordingly Kas4yapa and
<>his wives, Aditi and Surasa1, were born respectively as
<>Vasudeva, Devaki1 and Rohin2i1 in Gokula in the 28th
<>Dva1para yuga. (This story has been told by Vya1sa
<>to Ra1ja1 Janamejaya). (Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>3. {%Aditi in prison.%} Devaki1 is Aditi reborn. There was
<>reason for Devaki1 being imprisoned on the orders of
<>Kam3sa. When Kas4yapa was living in an A1s4rama with
<>Aditi and Diti he was so much pleased with the
<>services of Aditi that he asked her to beg for any
<>boon she wished. Accordingly she prayed for an
<>ideal son. The boon was readily granted, and Indra
<>was the son thus born to her. The birth of Indra
<>engendered jealousy in Diti towards Aditi, and she
<>also demanded a son equal to Indra. Kas4yapa obliged
<>Diti also. As Diti advanced in pregnancy and her
<>beauty also increased Aditi got jealous of the former
<>and she called her son Indra and told him that unless
<>something was done in time, Diti would deliver a
<>child equal to him (Indra) thus relegating him pro-
<>bably to the place of second Deva. Thus admonished
<>by his mother the artful Indra approached Diti and
<>told her: “Mother, I have come to serve you”. Diti
<>was greatly pleased. Indra's services drove Diti to
<>sleep very quickly, and Indra used the opportunity [Page004-a+ 65]
<>to enter the womb of Diti and cut into 49 pieces the
<>child with his weapon, the Vajra. The child in the
<>womb began crying on receiving cuts with Vajra when
<>Indra asked it not to cry. (Ma1 ruda, don't cry) and
<>so the child got out of Diti's womb as 49 Ma1rutas
<>(winds). Then did Diti wake up and cursed Aditi as
<>follows: “Your son did treacherously kill my
<>offspring in the womb itself. So he will forfeit the
<>three worlds. You were responsible for the murder of
<>my child. You will, therefore, have to spend days in
<>prison grieving over your children. Your children also
<>will be annihilated”. Because of this curse of Diti,
<>Indra once lost Devaloka and had to live elsewhere,
<>and Nahus2a functioned, for a time as Indra. (See
<>Nahus2a). In the 28th Dva1para yuga Aditi trans-
<>formed as Devaki1 had to be a captive of Kam3sa, and
<>Kam3sa killed her children by dashing them on the
<>ground. (Devi1bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>4. {%Naraka1sura stole the earrings of Aditi.%} Naraka1sura, who

<HI>6. {%Budha cursed Aditi.%} A story in the Maha1bha1rata
<>refers to Budha's once cursing Aditi. The ever increas-
<>ing power of Asuras made the Devas anxious. Aditi,
<>the mother of the Devas decided to send them all to
<>annihilate the Asuras. She had finished cooking food
<>for her sons, and lo! there appeared before her Budha
<>and asked for food. Aditi asked him to wait pending
<>her sons taking their food hoping that there would be
<>some food left after that. This caused Budha to lose

<>This story is related by S4ri1 Kr2sna to his mother on
<>his birth as the son of Vasudeva. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama

<HI>ADRIKA1. A nymph (devastri1). There is a story in
<>Devi1bha1gavata about her being cursed by a Brahmin
<>and turned into a fish.
<HI>ADR2S2T2ABHAYA is the curse put on King Janamejaya

<>of Sarama1 went to the place and was thrashed by
<>the brothers of Janamejaya. Seeing her weeping child
<>Sarama1 naturally got angry. She cursed the king
<>thus: “My son did not commit any offence; he did
<>not even look at the havis (oblations), nor did he

<>Vasis2t2ha came walking towards him. False pride
<>prevented either of them from giving way to the
<>other. The King got angry and whipped S4akti. S4akti
<>cursed the king and he was converted into a demon.
<>This happened at a period when sages Vasis2t2ha and
<>Vis4va1mitra were at logger-heads. Vis4va1mitra got
<>admitted into the body of King Kalma1s2apa1da a
<>demon called Kim3kara, and the king set out to take

<>was further promised all support by Vis4va1mitra.
<>Kalma1s2apa1da ate up all the hundred sons of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Overcome with grief Vasis2t2ha attempted suicide
<>many a time. But the spirit (A1tman) did not quit

<>hermitage with Adr2s4yanti1, wife of S4akti. One day
<>Vasis2t2ha heard distinct sounds of the chanting of
<>the Vedas and Adr2s4yanti1 told him that a child of
<>his son, S4akti, was developing in her womb and that
<>the vedic sounds heard were sounds produced by
<>that son chanting the vedic hymns. Vasis2t2ha thus
<>was happy to hear that the dynasty will not become
<>extinct and, so, gave up all ideas of suicide. Another
<>day Kalma1s2apa1da in the guise of the demon hurriedly
<>came to devour Adr2s4yanti1 and Vasis2t2ha gave him
<>redemption from the curse. He was restored to his

<HI>AGASTYA.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in this order
<>Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Su1rya-Agastya.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} A story occurs in Uttara-Ra1ma-Carita
<>about the birth of Agastya. Nimi was the son of Iks2-
<>va1ku of the Su1rya dynasty. When he ascended the
<>throne he decided to celebrate a sacrifice of long
<>duration. He invited Vasis2t2ha to perform the sacrifice.
<>But Vasis2t2ha, who had to participate in the sacrifice [Page005-a+ 65]
<>of Indra, could not accept the invitation and Nimi
<>had to return disappointed. At this he got angry,
<>sought the help of S4ata1nanda, the son of the great
<>hermit Gautama and the sacrifice was begun. Vasis2t2ha
<>did not like this. He cursed Nimi that life might be
<>separated from his body. Nimi retorted with the same
<>curse. Vasis2t2ha's spirit separated itself from his body
<>and began to roam about in the sky. At last he re-
<>quested Brahma1 to provide him with a body. Brahma1
<>granted his wish and said that he would be born again
<>from Mitra and Varun2a.
<NI>When the spirit of Vasis2t2ha returned to the earth it
<>was Mitra and Varun2a moving about, having only one
<>body for both. Vasis2t2ha's spirit entered into that body.
<>One day Mitra-Varun2a happened to see the celestial
<>beauty, Urvas4i1 on the seashore. They embraced Urvas4i1
<>and immediately the spirit of Vasis2t2ha entered the
<>body of Urvas4i1.
<NI>After this Mitra and Varun2a separated themselves
<>from one another and assumed two different bodies.
<>Varun2a approached Urvas4i1 with lustful desire, but
<>rejecting him Urvas4i1 accepted Mitra. Varun2a had
<>seminal flow and this semen was taken and kept in a
<>pot. At the sight of this, remorse and passion arose
<>in Urvas4i1 and the semen of Mitra already received
<>in her womb oozed out and fell on the ground. This
<>also was. collected and kept in the same pot along with
<>that of Varun2a. After a few days the pot broke open
<>by itself and two babies came out. One was Agastya
<>and the other Vasis2t2ha. As these two were born of the
<>semen of Mitra and Varun2a, they came to be known
<>as Maitra1varun2is later. This story partly occurs in S4a1nti
<>Parva of Maha1bha1rata, Verse 343 of Chapter 88.
<NI>3) {%Education.%} Very little is mentioned in the Pura1n2as
<>about the education of Agastya. Still there are am-
<>ple proofs that he was well-versed in the Vedas and
<>sciences and well skilled in the uses of diverse weapons.
<>In Verse 9, Chapter 139 of Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Dron2a says to Arjuna as follows:
<NI>“Agnives4a, my teacher was the disciple of Agastya, in the
<>art of using bows and arrows and I am his disciple”.
<NI>When it is said that even Agnives4a the teacher of
<>Dron2a was a disciple of Agastya, his proficiency in the
<>art of using weapons could casily be discerned.
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} There is an interesting story behind the
<>marriage of such an austere man as Agastya, who had
<>brought all the passions under control. As the hermit
<>Agastya was walking along the forest, he saw his
<>ancestors (Pitr2s) hanging head downwards in a canyon.
<>He wanted to know the reason and they replied:
<>“Child; we would be allowed to enter heaven only
<>if sons are born to you. So get married as soon as
<>possible”. The necessity of marriage occurred to him
<>only then. But will there be any woman who could be
<>patient enough to become the wife of this bearded
<>dwarfish hermit? Agastya did not lose heart. At that
<>time the King of Vidarbha was doing penance to
<>obtain a son. Agastya collected the quintessence of
<>all living beings, with which he created an extre-
<>mely beautiful lady and named her Lopa1mudra1.
<>Agastya gave Lopa1mudra1 as daughter to the King of
<>Vidarbha. The King who was delighted at getting
<>such a daughter, employed hundreds of maids to look
<>after the child, who soon grew up to be a young lady.
<>Agastya once approached the King of Vidarbha [Page005-b+ 65]
<>and expressed his wish to have Lopa1mudra1 as his
<>wife. The King was in a dilemma. On the one hand
<>he did not like his beautiful daughter having the
<>brightness of fire, to be given as wife to the hermit,
<>clad in the bark of trees and wearing tufts of matted
<>hair. On the other hand he was afraid of the curse
<>of the hermit Agastya. As the King was trying hard
<>to find a solution, Lopa1mudra1 herself came to the
<>King and said “Father, I am happy to say that I shall
<>willingly become the wife of the hermit Agastya.” At
<>last her father consented and discarding royal garments
<>and ornaments, Lopa1mudra1 accompanied Agastya.
<>It is mentioned in Vana Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 5,
<>that they were married at Maha1sindhuti1rtha. After
<>their marriage they went to Gan3ga1dva1ra. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 96).
<NI>5) {%The story of how Agastya ate Va1ta1pi.%} While Agastya
<>was doing severe penance, Lopa1mudra1 attained
<>puberty and had menstruation. Longing for a child,
<>she went and stood beside Agastya. She expressed
<>her wish to lead a family life. Her demands did
<>not stop there. During conjugation, Agastya should
<>wear flower garlands and ornaments, and she must
<>be provided with divine ornaments. Agastya was
<>surprised at the enormity of her demands. Poor, penni-
<>less Agastya! Leaving Lopa1mudra1 in the hermitage
<>he went in search of money. He at first approached
<>King S4rutarva1, who produced accounts of his in-
<>come and expenditure and convinced Agastya that
<>he was having no balance at all. Agastya, accompa-
<>nied by S4rutarva1, then proceeded to King Bradh-
<>na1s4va. He also produced accounts and refused to help
<>Agastya, who then followed by S4rutarva1 and Bradh-
<>na1s4va went on to the wealthy King Trasadasyu,
<>who also producing his accounts refused to render
<>any help to Agastya. Finally Agastya accompanied
<>by the three Kings, went to the house of Ilvala, a
<>noble asura of immense wealth.
<NI>This asura Ilvala lived in Manimatpattana with his
<>younger brother Va1ta1pi. Once Ilvala approached
<>a hermit Brahmin and requested that his wish for
<>a son, having the power and status of Indra, be grant-
<>ed. The Brahmin refused to grant such a boon.
<>Since then Ilvala and Va1ta1pi considered Brahmins
<>as their enemies. The elder brother converted the
<>younger one (Va1ta1pi) into a goat and whenever a
<>Brahmin visited his house, he would kill the goat,
<>prepare mutton dishes and set them before his
<>guest. When he had finished eating, Ilvala would call
<>aloud. “Va1ta1pi, come out”. Breaking the stomach
<>of the guest open, Va1ta1pi would come out. In this way
<>Ilvala had killed a good number of Bra1hmins. It was
<>at this juncture that Agastya and the Kings came to
<>beg money of him.
<NI>Ilvala welcomed the guests with hospitality and as
<>usual killed the goat, prepared food with it and served
<>the food before Agastya. When Agastya had finished
<>eating, Ilvala called Va1ta1pi loudly. But Agastya slowly
<>said, “Va1ta1pi, ji1rn2o bhava” (Let Va1ta1pi be digested)
<>and immediately Va1ta1pi was digested in the stomach
<>of Agastya. The awe-stricken asura Ilvala gave each
<>Brahmin ten thousand cows and as much gold and
<>to Agastya he doubled the quantity of alms. Over
<>and above this, he presented Agastya with a chariot
<>hitched with two fine horses called Vira1va1n and [Page006-a+ 63]
<>Sura1va1n. Agastya returned to his hermitage and
<>adorned himself as Lopa1mudra1 had demanded. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 99).
<NI>6) {%Birth of a son.%} Lopa1mudra1 became pregnant.
<>Agastya told her, “A thousand ordinary sons, or
<>hundred sons, each having the strength of ten ordinary
<>sons, or ten sons, each having the strength of hundred
<>ordinary sons, or a son, greater and nobler than one
<>thousand sons--which of these do you prefer?”
<>Lopa1mudra1 preferred one son. When she was with
<>child Agastya again went to the forest to do penance.
<>After seven years of pregnancy Lopa1mudra1 gave
<>birth to a lustrous son. The hermit Dr2d2hasyu, who is
<>also called Idhmava1ha, is this son. This child is said
<>to have chanted the Vedas (Holy Scriptures) im-
<>mediately on his birth. He used to gather twigs for
<>kindling the sacrificial fire of his father, and hence he
<>got the name Idhmava1ha.
<F>*) Idhma--twigs of firewood. (Idhma=twigs of firewood) (va1ha=carrier).</F>
<NI>7) {%How he stamped the Vindhya mountain down.%} Once the
<>talebearer Na1rada happened to come to the Vindhya
<>Mountain, who gladly welcomed Na1rada, gave him a
<>seat, showed hospitality and asked for news. Na1rada said
<>“May you be blessed. Just now I am coming from the
<>Maha1meru. Indra, Agni (fire) and other gods live
<>there. Kaila1sa, Nis2adha, Ni1la, Gandhama1dana etc. are
<>mountains far nobler than this Meru. But they are
<>not so haughty as him. That the Sun and the Moon
<>and such others revolve round him, is the reason for his
<>arrogance”. On hearing these tales, Vindhya thought
<>that Meru should be taught a lesson. Once Vindhya
<>made his peaks grow higher and higher till they touched
<>the sky. The Sun, the Moon and others found it very
<>difficult to pass over the high peaks in their usual jour-
<>neys to the West, and so they had to roam about in
<>the sky. When the journeys of the Sun and the Moon
<>were hindered, everything in the world fell into chaos.
<>The gods came to Vindhya in groups and tried to
<>pacify him. But their attempts were futile. So they
<>approached Agastya and made their petition to him.
<>He agreed to pacify Vindhya somehow or other. Agas-
<>tya and his wife came to Vindhya from Ka1s4inagara.
<>When Vindhya saw Agastya he began to shiver with
<>fear. Contracting all his high peaks, he bowed before
<>Agastya, who said to Vindhya thus “Vindhya, I am
<>going to South Bha1rata. Let your heads be low till I
<>come back”. Vindhya agreed. Agastya passed on to
<>the South and built a hermitage in the Malaya1cala and
<>lived there. Since then Agastya had never gone to
<>the North and Vindhya had never risen up. As he had
<>made the mountain (Aga) bow its head he got the
<>name Agastya. (Tenth Skandha of Devi1bha1gavata).
<NI>8) {%Nahus2a transformed to a huge serpent by Agastya.%}
<>Devendra killed Vr2ttra1sura, an enemy of the gods.
<>As Devendra had resorted to treachery for killing the
<>enemy (see the word Vr2ttra1sura) he incurred the sin
<>of ‘Brahmahatya1’. Once Indra went to the Ma1nasasaras,
<>without the knowledge of anybody and hid himself in
<>the petal of a lotus flower. The gods and especially
<>S4aci1devi1 were much alarmed at the disappearance of
<>Devendra. Heaven was without a King. Bad omens
<>began to appear. Indra, who had hidden in the lotus
<>stalk in the shape of a water-snake, was not at all visible [Page006-b+ 64]
<>as the petals had closed over him. It was at this critical
<>moment that King Nahus2a had completed hundred
<>horse-sacrifices and became eligible for the throne of
<>Devendra. At a great gathering of the Gods Nahus2a
<>was elected as Devendra. Though Nahus2a got all the
<>celestial maids at his disposal in the Nandanodya1na
<>(Nandana Garden) his passion for women was not
<>satiated. So he began to have an eye on Indra1n2i1. She
<>was in sorrow and misery at the disappearance of her
<>husband Indra, and did not at all look with favour on
<>this new move on the part of the new Indra. She sought
<>the help of Br2haspati, who agreed to protect her
<>from Nahus2a. The newly-elected Indra could not tole-
<>rate this disloyalty on the part of Indra1n2i1. He became
<>furious and threatened Br2haspati with death, if Indra1n2i1
<>was not sent to him forthwith. All hermits gathered
<>round Nahus2a and tried with their advice to dissuade
<>him from this attempt, but he would not be dissuaded.
<>Nahus2a belittled Br2haspati and all the hermits and was
<>rude to them. Finally the hermits, being afraid of
<>Nahus2a, went to Br2haspati to persuade him to send
<>Indra1n2i1 to Nahus2a. Br2haspati suggested to Indra1n2i1 a
<>way of safety. Accordingly she came to Nahus2a and said
<>to him “Lord, to become your wife, is a matter of great
<>pleasure to me. But before that I must make sure if
<>my husband is living anywhere. So allow me to make a
<>search”. Nahus2a agreed to this and by the blessings
<>of Devi1, Indra1n2i1 found out her husband. But Indra
<>would not return to the court, with Indra1n2i1, who
<>then complained about Nahus2a's outrageous behaviour.
<>Indra advised her a new way to protect herself from
<>Nahus2a's onslaught.
<NI>Indra1n2i1 returned to Nahus2a and told him “Lord, wo-
<>men generally love pomp and glory. I have a mania
<>for vehicles. You should make a palanquin. Let the
<>palanquin bearers be hermits. You must come to my
<>house in that palanquin with hermits as your palanquin
<>bearers and then I will accept you as my husband.”
<>Nahus2a agreed. He employed Agastya and such other
<>hermits to bear his palanquin. He got into his palan-
<>quin and started for Indra1n2i1's house. His desire to
<>reach Indra1n2i1 was such that he thought the hermits to
<>be very slow. To make them quick enough he ordered
<>“Sarpa, Sarpa” (walk quick, walk quick). The hermits
<>began to run. Still Nahus2a was not satisfied. He kicked
<>at the heads of the hermits and whipped the dwarfish
<>Agastya.
<NI>Agastya got angry and cursed Nahus2a thus: “Since
<>you have whipped me saying ‘Sarpa Sarpa’, may you
<>be transformed into a maha1sarpa (huge serpent) and
<>fall into the great forest.”
<F>**) It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 100, that the person who cursed Nahus2a and turned him
<>into a huge serpent, was the hermit Bhr2gu, who had been hiding in the hair of Agastya.</F>
<NI>The horror-stricken Nahus2a pleased Agastya by praise.
<>Agastya said that Nahus2a would be freed from the
<>curse and attain heaven when he happened to meet
<>Dharmaputra. Nahus2a instantly changed into a
<>serpent of immense size and slided into a great forest
<>in the Hima1laya1s. (Devi1bha1gavata, 8th Sarga).
<NI>During their sojourn in the forest, the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visited many holy places and reached the Ya1muna
<>mountain in the Hima1laya1s. When Bhi1ma was passing
<>by the mouth of a cave he was attacked by a huge
<>serpent. In spite of his immense strength Bhi1ma could [Page007-a+ 65]
<>not extricate himself from the hold of the snake, who
<>eventually informed Bhi1ma of its previous history.
<>When Bhi1ma understood that the serpent was none
<>other than Nahus2a, a King of the Su1rya dynasty
<>(Solar), he felt sorry for him. Dharmaputra, who
<>came there in search of Bhi1ma, talked with Nahus2a,
<>who immediately regained his original form and
<>went to heaven. (Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 17 of
<>Udyoga Parva; Chapter 179 of Vana Parva; Chapter
<>342 of S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>9) {%How Agastya drank up the ocean.%} Indra ruthlessly
<>killed Vr2ttra1sura, who had been harassing the Gods,
<>with the help of the Ka1lakeyas. The frightened Ka1la-
<>keyas got into the ocean and hid themselves at the
<>bottom. From that hideout they decided to destroy
<>the three worlds. At night they came out on the
<>earth and ate a good deal of Brahmins, and caused
<>much damage to the hermitages of Vasis2t2ha and
<>Cyavana. All the Brahmins on the earth were terribly
<>afraid of the Ka1lakeyas. The gods went to Vis2n2u
<>and prayed for protection. Vis2n2u informed them that
<>the Ka1lakeyas could not be caught unless the ocean
<>was dried up, and this task could be performed only
<>by Agastya. So the Gods approached Agastya and told
<>him what Vis2n2u had informed them. With pleasure
<>Agastya accepted the job. Accompanied by the Gods
<>and hermits he neared the swaying and surging ocean.
<>While all were watching unwinkingly Agastya brought
<>the great ocean into his palm and drank it up very
<>easily and subsequently the Ka1lakeyas were killed.
<>Now the Gods again approached Vis2n2u and made
<>representation about the loss of the ocean. Vis2n2u told
<>them that by the penance of Bhagi1ratha the divine
<>Gan3ga1 would fall into the earth and then the ocean
<>will be filled. In this way the earth regained its lost
<>ocean. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapters 101 to
<>105).
<NI>10) {%Agastya cursing Kubera and his companion.%} In the
<>course of their sojourn in forest, the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visited several holy places and reached the proximity
<>of the Hima1layas. Leaving his brothers behind,
<>Arjuna went up the Maha1meru to worship S4iva.
<>Years passed by. At last his brothers also started
<>for the Maha1meru in search of Arjuna and with
<>the help of the hermits Vr2s2aparva1 and A1rs2t2is2en2a, they
<>reached Kuberapuri1 (the capital of Kubera). There
<>Bhi1ma destroyed the army of Kubera and killed
<>Man2ima1n, his friend and favourite. Dharmaputra,
<>repenting of his younger brother's iniquity bowed
<>before Kubera and asked him with politeness, why the
<>power of Gods gave way to the power of man. Kubera
<>replied that it was due to the curse of Agastya and
<>began to depict the event thus: Once my friend
<>Man2ima1n and myself were going, in a chariot, to be
<>present at the singing and chanting just begun at
<>Kus4avati1. At that time Agastya was standing in his
<>hermitage on the bank of Ka1lindi1, performing Sun
<>worship. When Man2ima1n saw this from the sky, he
<>spat on the head of Agastya, who instantly getting wild
<>cursed me. “Lo, Kubera, your friend Man2ima1n
<>spat on my head in your sight. So this Man2ima1n and
<>your army will meet with death at a man's hand.
<>When they die you should not feel sorry for them. If
<>it becomes possible for you to meet the man who
<>killed Man2ima1n you will be liberated from the curse.” [Page007-b+ 65]
<>It is this curse that brought about the death of
<>Man2ima1n and the army. When Kubera saw Bhi1ma
<>face to face his curse was revoked. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 160).
<NI>11) {%Agastya cursing Ma1ri1ca and Ta1d2aka1.%} The boys
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went to the forest with Vis4va1-
<>mitra for protecting sacrifice. When they entered the
<>Ta1d2aka1 forest Vis4va1mitra told them the story of
<>Ta1d2aka1 thus:--
<NI>Ta1d2aka1 is the daughter of Suketu, a semi god of the
<>tribe Yaks2a. Being childless for a long time Suketu was
<>miserable and began to do penance before Brahma1,
<>who blessed him and granted his wish and a daughter
<>was born to him. This daughter was named Ta1d2aka1.
<>Brahma1 blessed her, giving her the strength of one
<>thousand elephants. Ta1d2aka1 grew up and became a
<>young woman. Suketu gave her in marriage to Sunda,
<>son of Iharjha. Ta1d2aka1 gave birth to a son called
<>Ma1ri1ca. When Sunda was killed, Ta1d2aka1 got wild
<>and ran into the hermitage of Agastya causing much
<>havoc there. At this Agastya got angry and cursed
<>her to become a Ra1ks2asi1 (giantess) and instantly
<>the bodies of Ta1d2aka1 and Ma1ri1ca were deformed.
<>Ta1d2aka1 could not control her anger and she demo-
<>lished the hermitage of Agastya. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,

<NI>12) {%The story of the theft of lotus.%} Once Bhr2gu,
<>Vasis2t2ha and other hermits went on a pilgrimage,
<>with Indra as their leader. On the way they
<>reached Brahmasaras, in the holy place of Kaus2iki1.
<>Agastya had grown some lotus flowers there. The
<>pilgrims plucked stealthily all the lotus flowers nur-
<>tured by Agastya and ate them. The furious Agastya
<>got into the midst of the hermits in search of the
<>culprit. None admitted the theft. Finally he caught
<>hold of Indra, as the thief. Indra said “O, Lord,
<>had it not been for my eagerness to hear discourses
<>on duty from your face, I would not have stolen
<>your lotus flowers.” Saying thus Indra returned the
<>lotus flowers. Agastya was pleased and let Indra

<>became angry and began to burn the Asuras to death,
<>by the merits of his penance. Many of them fell down
<>on the earth and some fell into Pa1ta1la (the nether world).

<>Thunder and Rain) stopped rain in the world. Crops [Page008-a+ 65]
<>could not be raised. But Agastya provided everybody
<>who took part in the sacrifice, with sumptuous meals.
<>The hermits wondered how Agastya could do this. Some
<>of the hermits feared that the sacrifice would have to be
<>stopped before the stipulated time, if the drought con-
<>tinued. Agastya told them not to fear, and that if
<>Indra refused to send rain, he himself would become
<>Indra and protect the subjects. Indra was horrified,
<>when he heard this and he began to send rain regu-
<>larly. (Maha1bha1rata, A1s4vamedhika Parva, Chapter
<>92).
<NI>15) {%Story of Gajendramoks2a (The redemption of an elephant).%}
<>In the Bha1rata a story occurs, as to how Agastya
<>cursed King Indradyumna, and turned him to an ele-

<>absorbed in deep meditation on Vis2n2u, Agastya reach-
<>ed the palace. Being immersed in meditation the King
<>failed to notice the arrival of the great hermit, who
<>getting angry with the King, cursed him to become an
<>elephant, for one thousand years. Instantly the King
<>was deformed into a big tusker and quitting the palace
<>it went to a big forest and lived there happily with the
<>she-elephants there. At that time a hermit named De-
<>vala was doing penance in that forest. One day Hu1hu,
<>a gandharva (a class of semi-gods) enjoying the com-
<>pany of some celestial maids came to the place where
<>Devala had put up his hermitage. The hermit saw
<>the Gandharva and the maids playing and bathing in
<>the pond in front of his hermitage in complete nudity.
<>Getting angry Devala cursed Hu1hu and he was de-
<>formed into a crocodile. This pond which was in the
<>Triku1t2a Mountain was thus under the suzerainty of
<>the crocodile. The tusker (Indradyumna) entered the
<>pond to drink water. The crocodile caught hold of the
<>leg of the elephant. Each tried to pull the other with
<>equal force. This fight is said to have lasted for a
<>thousand years. When both were tired, godly feelings
<>began to dawn in their minds. Then, riding on an
<>eagle Maha1vis2n2u appeared before them, cut them
<>asunder with his Cakra1yudha (the wheel-weapon)
<>and both were given deliverance. (Bha1gavata, 8th
<>Skandha, Chapter 2).

<>immediately the image of Vis2n2u in the temple chang-
<>ed by itself into a S4ivalin3ga (idol representing S4iva).

<>come here everyday and eat corpse and when I had
<>completed ten thousand days the hermit Agastya
<>would come here and that when I offered him a golden

<>Agastya, who had performed such wonderful deeds by

<>hermitages. In the Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, A1ran2yaka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 11, a description is given, of a beautiful hermit-
<>age of Agastya, and the peaceful atmosphere that
<>prevailed in and around it. Agastya had presented to

<>visited his hermitage. Agastya had accompanied S4ri1
<>Ra1ma and his followers on his return journey to
<>Ayodhya1 from Lan3ka1, with Si1ta1 after killing Ra1van2a.
<>There is a legend in the Tamilna1d that Agastya was a
<>member of the first two ‘San3ghas’ (groups) of the
<>“three San3ghas”, mentioned in Tamil literature. As
<>Agastya was dwarfish he is mentioned as Kurumuni,
<>(short hermit) in Tamil works. He has written a Tamil
<>grammar on music, literature and drama. But this
<>work is not available now. The Tamil Grammar
<>‘Tolka1pyam’, which is considered to be the oldest gram-
<>mar, was written by Tolka1pya1r, one of the twelve
<>disciples of Agastya. Even today in certain temples in
<>the Tamilna1d, Agastya-worship is carried on. Kambar,
<>has mentioned about Agastya in his Ra1ma1yan2a. A great

<>trapped in his belly. Agha then closed his mouth and
<>all the boys including S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a were now imprisoned
<>inside his body. Some of the boys died. Realizing the
<>situation S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a now enlarged his body. His body
<>grew larger and larger until at last it burst open the body
<>of the serpent (Agha). Thus Agha was killed. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a

<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were for some time living in an

<>Ra1van2a and save the world from his atrocities. Si1ta1 is
<>going to be a cause for that. Time is not far for you
<>to finish this duty of yours. Ra1van2a is soon to come and

<>Si1ta1 after killing Ra1van2a you will be compelled to
<>throw your wife into the fire to test her chastity. At [Page011-a+ 65]
<>that time I will take back the replica and give you
<>back your real wife”. S4ri1 Ra1ma was very much
<>pleased to hear this. Agni then, by his yogic powers
<>created a Phantom Si1ta1 and gave her to him. Ra1ma
<>kept this as a secret even from Laks2man2a. In the great
<>Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle Ra1van2a was killed and S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>took back Si1ta1 to his kingdom. Then respecting public
<>opinion and wishing to establish in public the purity
<>of his queen King S4ri1 Ra1ma put her into the fire. At
<>that moment Agni took back the replica and gave
<>back the real Si1ta1 to S4ri1 Ra1ma. Si1ta1 thus came out
<>from the fire unscathed. Later, on the advice of Ra1ma
<>and Agni, the Phantom Si1ta1 went to the sacred place
<>Pus2kara and started doing tapas (penance) there.
<>After doing tapas for a long period of three lakhs of
<>divine years this Phantom Si1ta1 became known as
<>Svargalaks2mi1. It was this Svargalaks2mi1 that later on
<>in the Dva1para yuga came out from the yajn5a kun2d2a

<NI>7) {%The story of how Agni burnt the big forest, Kha1n2d2ava.%}
<>When the indigestion continued without abate for some
<>time Agni approached Brahma1 and asked for a cure.
<>Brahma1 declared that his indigestion would be cured
<>if Agni could burn the huge forest, Kha1n2d2ava, the
<>abode of the enemies of the Devas. Agni immediately
<>started consuming the forest. But the inhabitants of the
<>forest soon quenched the fire. Disappointed Agni went
<>to Brahma1 again and the latter advised him to wait for
<>some time till the advent of Nara-Na1ra1yan2as to that
<>forest. They would then help Agni to burn the forest.
<>Agni waited for the time to come. At that time the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were living in Indraprastha with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>When the heat became unbearable there Arjuna and
<>Kr2s2n2a came to the banks of river Yamuna1. Hearing
<>about the arrival of Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna who were none
<>but the incarnations of Na1ra1yan2a and Nara, Agni dis-
<>guised as a brahmin approached them and requested
<>them to help him to burn the Kha1n2d2ava forest. Agni
<>added that any attempt of his to burn the forest was [Page011-b+ 65]
<>always foiled by Indra who would send a heavy down-
<>pour of rain to quench the fire because Taks2aka, an
<>intimate friend of Indra, was living there.
<NI>To gain his end Agni gave Arjuna an arrow-case
<>which would never be empty, a chariot bearing a
<>monkey flag, four white horses adorned with gold
<>chains and also the famous Ga1n2d2i1va bow. To S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>he gave the cakra1yudha or the divine wheel-weapon.
<>(All these military equipments were once given to
<>Agni by Varun2a.) When all these were given to them
<>Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna got ready to help Agni to burn the
<>forest. Agni started burning the forest, Indra at once
<>sent a heavy downpour of rain and Arjuna created a
<>canopy of arrows above the forest preventing the rains
<>from falling on the forest. Agni carried on his work
<>undisturbed, the forest was burnt and Agni was cured
<>of his indigestion. (S4lokas 233 to 239, A1di Parva,

<NI>8) {%Agni falls in love.%} As an inaugural procedure to the
<>great Ra1jasu1ya which Dharmaputra performed at
<>Indraprastha his four brothers Bhi1ma, Arjuna, Nakula
<>and Sahadeva conducted a victory march to the four
<>different sides of the kingdom. Sahadeva who turned
<>south conquered many kings including Dantavaktra
<>and Bhi1s2maka and reached a country called Ma1his2mati1-
<>pura. There he had to encounter a powerful king
<>called Ni1la. Before long there broke a fire in his camp.
<>Disheartened, Sahadeva prayed to the God, Agni, for
<>help. It was then that Sahadeva came to know about
<>the ties between Agni and Ni1la.
<NI>King Ni1la had a beautiful daughter named Sudars4ana1.
<>Once when she was talking to her father after having
<>entered the Agni-hotra Agni fell in love with her. From
<>that day onwards Agni became dreamy about the
<>beautiful lips of Sudars4ana1. It reached a stage when
<>Agni would burn only if it was blown by the lips of
<>Sudars4ana1. This ended in Agni marrying Sudars4ana1.
<>After the marriage Agni lived in the palace of his
<>father-in-law, King Ni1la, as a useful ally. It was at this
<>time that Sahadeva came to conquer Ni1la. But Agni
<>knew that for the proper conduct of the Ra1jasu1ya of

<>and dropped down into the lap of the Emperor who

<>came chasing its prey and finding the dove in the lap
<>of the Emperor said: “O King, is it proper on your

<>offered many things including his kingdom to the

<>of flesh from the body of the Emperor. S4ibi without
<>any hesitation cut a portion of his thigh and weighed
<>it against the dove in a scale. The dove weighed more
<>and the Emperor started putting more and more flesh
<>from his body to make the weight equal. But the dove [Page012-a+ 59]
<>always weighed more and at last the Emperor said he
<>would weigh himself against the dove. As the weak and

<>with his beautiful consort, Ahalya1. Once Indra had an
<>intercourse with her privately and Gautama coming to
<>know of the misdeed cursed her and turned her into

<NI>11) {%How sage Bhr2gu cursed Agni.%} Sage Bhr2gu was living
<>with his wife Puloma1 in his a1s4rama. Puloma1 became
<>pregnant. One day when Bhr2gu wanted to go out for
<>a bath in the river he asked Agni to keep a watch over
<>his pregnant wife. There was a demon by name
<>Puloma who was once in love with Puloma1. On this
<>particular day Puloma entered the a1s4rama to see
<>his former love. When he entered the a1s4rama Puloma
<>saw Agni there burning with a brilliant flame in the
<>fire-pit. Puloma said: “O God of fire, if I ask you a
<>question you must give me an impartial reply. I was
<>in love with this Puloma1 and I had accepted her as
<>my wife spiritually. But, then, her father gave her to
<>Bhr2gu. Who, then, is the true owner of Puloma1?”
<>Agni was afraid of Bhr2gu. Yet he explained the posi-
<>tion honestly. “It is true that Puloma1 has married
<>Bhr2gu. But he has not married her according to Hindu
<>rites.” Hearing this the demon changed himself into
<>the shape of a swine and carried away Puloma1. On
<>the way Puloma1 delivered a male babe and it fell on
<>the ground. The boy was named Cyavana. It was this
<>boy that became later on the famous Cyavana Maha-
<>rs2i. Even at birth the boy was brilliant as the Sun
<>to look at and Puloma, the demon, noticing the un-
<>usual brilliance of the child left the mother and child
<>on the way and fled frightened. Puloma1 returned to the
<>a1s4rama carrying the child weeping profusely all the
<>way and creating a lanchrymal river called Vadhu1-
<>saras. As soon as she entered the a1s4rama the angry
<>sage asked “Who told Puloma that you are my wife?”
<>Puloma1 then told her husband all that happened there
<>and Bhr2gu called Agni and cursed him thus: “May
<>you be a consumer of all things on this Earth”. Great-
<>ly aggrieved Agni went away and hid himself. The
<>absence of Agni created chaos in all the three worlds;
<>Heaven, Earth and the Nether-world. A deputation of
<>all the afflicted people waited upon Brahma1 and [Page012-b+ 65]
<>Brahma1 modified the curse and declared that all that
<>Agni touched would become pure. Agni was consoled
<>and he started his work as usual.
<NI>12) {%How Agni cursed frogs, birds and elephants.%} Many
<>important events took place while Agni was under-
<>ground cursed by Bhr2gu. It was during that time that
<>Pa1rvati1 cursed all the Devas and the Devas were
<>defeated by the asuras (demons). The necessity of a
<>warrior capable of defeating the asuras arose then.
<>The idea of creating Lord Subrahman2ya came up and
<>Brahma1 said that only Agni could help them in this
<>matter since Agni was the only one who escaped from
<>the curse of Pa1rvati1, being underground at the time
<>of the curse. The Devas started a vigilant search but
<>Agni was not to be found. Agni was then hiding inside
<>the ocean. The ocean was getting hot and the animals
<>living there found their life unbearable. Frogs went to
<>the devas and told them where Agni was hiding.
<>Enraged at this Agni cursed the frogs saying that they
<>would never be able to find the taste of anything.
<>Frogs went weeping to the devas who in turn blessed
<>the frogs saying that they would acquire the ability to
<>move about easily in any darkness. Agni changed his
<>place of hiding and went and hid in a big banyan
<>tree. An elephant going by that way found him out
<>and informed the devas; knowing this Agni cursed
<>the elephants saying that its tongue would go deep
<>inside. But the devas blessed the elephants saying that
<>the position of the tongue would never be a hindrance
<>to free eating and that elephants would be able to eat
<>anything and everything. Agni left the banyan tree
<>and hid himself in the hollow of a S4ami1 tree. A little
<>bird living in that tree gave information to the devas
<>and the devas found him out before he got time to
<>leave the place. Agni cursed the bird saying that its
<>tongue would always be curved inside and the devas
<>blessed it saying that the curvature would help it to
<>sing beautiful songs. Since Agni was found out from
<>S4ami1 tree this tree became sacred. Since this finding
<>out of Agni after a long absence is like a re-birth of
<>Agni the Pura1n2as mention that Agni was born from
<>the S4ami1 tree. The Devas then requested Agni to help
<>them to create a son capable of conquering the de-
<>mons.
<F>*) Katha1saritsa1gara gives another version of why Agni went and hid himself under the ocean. When Ka1ma, the God of Love, was
<>burnt to death by S4iva, Pa1rvati1, S4iva1's wife, did not find a way to get a child for her from her husband. At last Brahma1 approached S4iva and
<>told him that the absence of Ka1ma was making creation difficult. S4iva then declared that thereafter Ka1ma would find a place in the minds of all
<>living beings including himself. Pa1rvati1 and S4iva immediately commenced a sexual life which went on incessantly for a hundred years with-
<>out reaching the climax. The world was agitated and the universe stood on the verge of ruin. The Devas decided to send Agni to intervene But
<>Agni was afraid of S4iva and so went and bid himself under the ocean. (Chapter 6, La1va1n2akalambaka of Katha1saritsa1gara).</F> (Chapter 85, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>13) {%Birth of Subrahman2ya.%} At that time Varun2a performed
<>a ya1ga. All the dikpa1lakas (zone guardians of the
<>universe) including S4iva participated in the ya1ga.
<>Seeing the beautiful wives of the sages S4iva had emission.
<>Taking the semen in his hand he put it into the fire.
<>Agni carried it to Gan3ga1 and requested her to take it
<>for conception. Though she at first refused she took it,
<>became pregnant and finally delivered a male child
<>whom she threw into the forest S4aravan2a. It was this
<>child who became known as Ka1rttikeya or Subrah-

<>Damayanti1 who was confused prayed that she should
<>be shown the real Nala. The gods then changed into

<>they went to Pan5canada and started doing penance.
<>Ram3bha sat in the centre of Pan5ca1gni (five fires) and
<>Karam3bha in water to do penance. Indra afraid of the
<>severe and powerful tapas of the two took the form of
<>a crocodile and killed Karam3bha who was doing pe-
<>nance in water by dragging him down to the water. Be-
<>reaved Ram3bha started to commit suicide by jumping
<>into the fire. God Agni appeared before him then and
<>asked him what he wanted. Ram3bha then said that he
<>should get a son who would be famous as a warrior in
<>all the three worlds. Agni agreed. Ram3bha on his way
<>back saw a voluptuous she-buffalo and married her
<>at yaks2a kava1t2a. They lived a happy married life and
<>one day a he-buffalo envious of their life attacked
<>Ram3bha and killed him. Grief-stricken Ram3bha's wife
<>jumped into the funeral pyre and committed suicide.
<>Then from the fire arose a demon named Mahis2a1sura
<>(Mahis2a=Buffalo. Asura=Demon). This buffalo-
<>demon became a terror to all in the three worlds later
<>on. (Chapter 5, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<>ed at this. Agni argued that it was not proper on the
<>part of Brahma1 to give anybody else more brilliance
<>than himself. So as a protest against this Agni dis-
<>appeared from the world. Even An3giras was annoyed at
<>Agni's disappearance and so he went and consoled Agni
<>and took him to Brahma1. Brahma1 declared that hence-
<>forth the world world recognize Agni as the father and
<>An3giras as his son. Thus Agni got the first place in
<>effulgence. This is a story told by sage Ma1rkan2d2eya

<>the vehicle he uses is a goat. (Chapter 51, Agni Pura1n2a).
<NI>15) The sage, Agastya, converted the Vis2n2u idol at the
<>Kutta1lam temple into one of S4iva and when people
<>around started an agitation Agastya sent forth flames
<>of fire through his eyes. (Asura Ka1n2d2a of Ska1nda
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>16) Agni was born to Pururavas as a son named Ja1ta-
<>vedas. (Chapter 14, Navama Skandha of Bha1gavata). [Page015-a+ 65]
<NI>17) The Devas wanted help to clean their hands when
<>oblated materials stuck to their hands and Agni creat-
<>ed from water three sons named Ekata, Dvita and
<>Trita for this purpose. Of these Trita fell into a well
<>while drawing water. Seeing him fall the demons
<>closed the well but Trita broke the top and came out.
<>(Su1kta 52, Anuva1ka 10, Man2d2ala 1 of R2gveda).
<NI>18) Once the earth looked like heaven because of the
<>innumerable celestial beings who came to earth in search
<>of Agni. (Su1kta 65, Anuva1ka 12, Man2d2ala 1 of R2g-
<>veda).
<NI>19) The Sun hands over his effulgence to Agni in the
<>evening and takes it back from him in the morning. (A
<>fact from S4ruti--Su1kta 71, Anuva1ka 12, Man2d2ala 1 of
<>R2gveda).
<NI>20) For making fire for the sacrificial ceremony the
<>sages use two Aran2i sticks (These are two pieces of wood,
<>one upper and another lower, and fire is produced by
<>attrition). It is believed that the sages get the strength
<>to produce fire from it through Vya1na, one of the forms
<>of Va1yu (air). So R2gveda describes Agni as the son of
<>Va1yu. (Su1kta 112, Anuva1ka 16, Man2d2ala 1).
<NI>21) In the times of the R2gveda Agni was worshipped
<>as a God. (Su1kta 1, Anuva1ka 1, Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).
<NI>22) Lord S4iva entered into an elaborate and long
<>conjugal play for creating Subrahman2ya. Hundred
<>years went by and still the preliminaries never ended.
<>The universe was on the verge of a collapse and so
<>the devas decided to send Agni to put a stop to this
<>libidinal play of S4iva. But Agni was afraid of S4iva and
<>therefore absconded and hid himself in the ocean. The
<>ocean became hot and the water-animals unable to
<>bear the increasing heat went and informed the devas of
<>Agni's hiding place. Agni cursed them all saying that all
<>of them would go dumb. He then went to the Mandara
<>mountain in the shape of an owl and hid there. But the
<>devas went there also and picked him up. Agni then by
<>his terrible heat stimulated S4iva into action. S4iva
<>threw his semen into Agni and Agni poured it into
<>Gan3ga1 and Gan3ga1 delivered a child which later on be-
<>came Subrahman2ya. (Taran3ga 6, La1va1n2akalam3baka
<>of Katha1saritsa1gara).
<NI>26) {%Conclusion.%} Agni stands next to Indra in impor-
<>tance in the Vedas. Because Agni1 was indispensable for
<>ya1gas the care of Agni became very important. Accord-
<>ing to the R2gveda the birth of Agni is different. Born
<>of the clouds Agni reaches the earth as lightning. Then
<>Agni forsakes its form and becomes invisible. It was
<>Ma1taris4va1 who gave form to Agni and gave him to the
<>Bhr2gu family. From that day onwards it became
<>possible to produce fire and the R2gveda describes how
<>Agni is produced by sages by the use of Aran2i sticks.
<>The main job of Agni is to receive the oblations from
<>devas when they conduct ya1gas.

<>Ra1van2a, he wanted to accept her as his wife only after
<>her purity had been tested and proved. So he decided to
<>test her by fire (Agnipari1ks2an2a). Si1ta1 shed tears at the
<>thought that her husband doubted her chastity.
<>Laks2man2a, at Ra1ma's bidding, made a pyre. Si1ta1

<>of how Ahalya1 was cursed by her husband, Gautama,
<>and was turned into a stone is told in different versions
<>in different pura1n2as. The following is the version in the
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. When Vis4va1mitra was taking back
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a from the forest to the palace of
<>Janaka they came across an a1s4rama on their way. Giving
<>details about that a1s4rama Visva1mitra told the princes
<>thus: “This is the a1s4rama where the sage, Gautama, was
<>living with his wife, Ahalya1. Indra fell in love with the
<>beautiful Ahalya1 and while the sage was out for bathing
<>Indra entered the a1s4rama in the disguise of the sage
<>himself and took bed with her. But before Indra could
<>get out Gautama himself came to the a1s4rama and en-
<>raged at what he saw, cursed them both. Indra was to
<>lose his testicles and Ahalya1 was to turn into a stone.
<>But taking pity on her the sage declared that she would
<>take her original form the moment Ra1ma of treta1 yuga
<>came to that place and touched the stone by his foot.
<>Testicleless Indra went to devaloka and there his friends
<>feeling sorry for him, substituted a goat's testicle and
<>got him to normal.” While Vis4va1mitra was talking to
<>the princes, S4ri1 Ra1ma's foot touched the stone and Ahalya1
<>stood up in all beauty. Ahalya1 and Gautama lived in
<>the same a1s4rama again for another long period.
<NI>In Katha1saritsa1gara this story is told in a slightly diffe-
<>rent yet more interesting way. As soon as Gautama
<>entered the a1s4rama Indra turned himself into a cat.
<>Angrily the sage questioned Ahalya1, “who was standing
<>here when I came in?” Ahalya1 replied, “Eso thiyo khu
<>majjara” (Es2ah2 sthitah2 khalu ma1rjja1rah2). It was a cat
<>which was standing there. Here Ahalya1 used a pun on
<>the word ‘majjara’ and tried to be honest. ‘Majjara’ is
<>the Prakrit form of the word ‘ma1rjja1rah2’ which means cat.
<>But ‘majjara’ has another meaning also. (ma=mine
<>ja1ra=lover i.e. majja1ra=my lover). So Ahalya1 did not
<>lie to her husband. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1nakalam-
<>baka).
<NI>3) {%How Ahalya1 happened to bring up the mighty monkeys, Ba1li
<>and Sugri1va.%} Once Arun2a, the charioteer of Su1rya (the
<>Sun) went to devaloka to see the dance of the celestial
<>maidens there. Since there was no admission to the dance
<>for men Arun2a disguised himself as A1run2idevi1 and sought
<>admission; seeing the beautiful form of A1run2idevi1 Indra
<>fell in love with her and that night a child was born to
<>Indra by her. On the advice of Indra A1run2idevi1 took the
<>child to Ahalya1 before daybreak and left it there to be
<>looked after by her. It was this child which later on
<>became the famous Ba1li.
<NI>Arun2a went a bit late that morning to his master, the
<>Sun. The latter wanted an explanation and Arun2a told
<>him what had happened. The Sun then asked Arun2a to
<>become A1run2idevi1 again and seeing the enchanting figure
<>the Sun also got a child of her. This child also was taken
<>to Ahalya1 and it was this child that later on became the
<>famous Sugri1va.
<HI>AHALYA1HRADA(M). A sacred pond in the tapovana [Page018-a+ 65]

<HI>AHARA. A son born of Danu to Kas4yapa. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, S4loka 25, Chapter 65).
<HI>AHICCHATRA. This was the capital of the state Ahi-
<>cchatra which Dron2a got from Drupada, the King of
<>Pa1n5ca1la.
<HI>AHICCHATRA(M). A state under the sovereignty of

<>Ahicchatra to Dron2a and got his release. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, S4lokas 73 to 76, Chapter 137).
<HI>AHIM3SA1. Non-injury. There are opinions both in favour
<>of and against Ahim3sa1 in the pura1n2as. S4ukra1ca1rya ex-
<>tols the importance of Ahim3sa1 to the asuras (demons)

<NI>“Oh, foes of the devas, I shall tell you the truth which is
<>good for you. Non-injury to any living being is the most
<>righteous thing. Do not molest even those who come to
<>kill you. Even that act would be ‘him3sa1’ (injury). It
<>was those brahmins who were attached to worldly plea-
<>sures and addicted to overeating that enjoined in the
<>Vedas that him3sa1 is permissible for ya1gas.” (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skanda 4). Ma1rkan2d2eya Muni (sage) says thus:
<>“Why should I mind the innumerable killings going on
<>unnoticed in this world full of life. People of old speak
<>very sacredly about Ahim3sa1. But O best of brahmins,
<>who can live in this world without injury to another
<>life?” (M.B., Aran2ya Parva, S4lokas 32 & 33, Chapter
<>208).
<HI>AHIRATHA. A King of the Pu1ru dynasty. (See under
<>Pu1ru vam3s4a).
<HI>AHIRBUDHNYA. One of the sons of Vis4vakarma1. Five
<>sons and one daughter were born to Vis4vakarma1 of his
<>wife Surabhi1. They were Ajaikapa1t, Ahirbudhnya,
<>Tvas2t2a1, Rudra, Barhis2mati1 and Sam3jn5a1. (See under
<>genealogy of Vis4vakarma1).
<HI>AHITA1. A river of ancient Bha1rata. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,

<HI>AHORA1TRA(M). (See under Ka1lama1na).
<HI>AHOVI1RA. A sage who adhered strictly to the injunctions
<>associated with the Va1naprastha stage of life. (M.B.,

<HI>AI ({#E#}). This diphthong means a female sage (yogini1)
<>according to the Agni Pura1n2a (Chapter 348 of Agni

<>94 of A1di Parva of the M.B.).
<HI>AILA I. Son of Ila1; Puru1ravas. (See under Ila1).
<HI>AILA II. A member of the court of Yamara1ja. (See S4loka
<>16, Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.). In S4loka 65, Chap-
<>ter 115 of Anus4a1sana Parva, it is said that he never ate
<>non-vegetarian food in his life. [Page018-b+ 64]
<HI>AINDAVA. (See paragraph 13 under the word
<>BRAHMA1).
<HI>AIRA1VATA I. A large elephant, son of Ira1vati1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in this order:--
<>Vis2n2u-Brahma1-Kas4yapa-Bhadramata1-Ira1vati1-Aira1-
<>vata. Kas4yapa married Daks2a's daughter, Krodhavas4a1
<>who bore him ten daughters. They were: Mr2gi1, Mr2ga-
<>manda1, Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, Sveta1,
<>Surabhi1, Sarasa1 and Kadru. Of these Bhadramata1 had
<>a daughter named Ira1vati1 and Aira1vata was her son.
<>Aira1vata was not human in shape; he was a large ele-
<>phant. (See Sarga 14, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Indra's Va1hana.%} Indra made Aira1vata his conveyance
<>(va1hana). Indra was Kas4yapa's son by Aditi. Aira1vata
<>also was descended from Kas4yapa. So Indra took
<>Aira1vata as his va1hana.
<NI>3) {%Aira1vata caused the churning of the ocean of Milk.%} There
<>is a story of how Aira1vata was responsible for the churn-
<>ing of the milk-ocean (Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam). Once
<>some maidens of devaloka presented a garland of flowers
<>to sage Durva1sas. When Durva1sas visited Indra's court
<>he gave that garland to Indra. Indra put it on the tusks
<>of his va1hana, Aira1vata. The fragrance of the flowers
<>attracted a swarm of bees which became an intolerable
<>nuisance to Aira1vata. So Aira1vata tore the garland off
<>his tusks and hurled it away. When Durva1sas heard
<>this, he took it as an insult. In his anger he cursed all the
<>gods--the curse was that all gods should become subject
<>to old age and the decrepitude and infirmities of old age.
<>But though Durva1sas cursed the gods, he also prescribed
<>a remedy. The gods could redeem themselves from the
<>curse by drinking Amr2tam obtained from the ocean of
<>Milk (Maha1vis2n2u lies on the serpent, S4es2a on this ocean).
<>The curse began to operate and the gods lost their peren-
<>nial youth. The gods then befriended the Asuras and
<>with their help they churned the ocean of Milk. They
<>got the nectar (Amr2tam), drank it and regained their
<>youth. (See under the word AMR2TAM).
<NI>4) There is another story about Aira1vata--A story of
<>how he also rose out of the ocean of Milk. It is said that
<>when the devas and asuras churned the ocean of Milk,
<>Aira1vata also came up along with the other good things.
<>This story is narrated in the 18th Chapter of A1di Parva
<>of the Maha1bha1rata. The explanation given is that when
<>Durva1sas cursed the gods, Aira1vata was oppressed with
<>a sense of guilt because he was responsible for the curse.
<>So he took refuge in the ocean of Milk and there started
<>propitiating Maha1vis2n2u. There is however no warrant
<>for such an explanation in the pura1n2as. But the expla-
<>nation sounds plausible because it explains the absence
<>of Aira1vata during the interval between Durva1sas's
<>curse and the churning of the sea. Aira1vata is represented
<>as a white elephant. It is probable that he became white
<>after his long residence in the ocean of Milk. This lends
<>some additional plausibility to the above explanation.
<NI>5) {%Aira1vata, the Lord of the elephant.%} In the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>we are told how Aira1vata was made the chief of all ele-
<>phants. When the Mahars2is had crowned Pr2thu as the
<>sovereign King, Brahma1 gave new posts of honour to
<>many of the devas. He made SOMA (Moon) the lord
<>of the Stars and Planets, of Brahmins, Yajn5as and herbs.
<>Kubera was made the overlord of all Kings; Varun2a
<>was made the master of the seas and all water; Vis2n2u,
<>the lord of the A1dityas and Pa1vaka (Fire) the lord of [Page019-a+ 62]
<>the Vasus. Along with these Brahma1 made Aira1vata the
<>lord of all elephants. (Chapter 22, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%The breaking of Aira1vata's tusks.%} There is a story of how
<>the tusks of Aira1vata were broken narrated in the A1sura-
<>ka1n2d2a of Skanda Pura1n2a. Once an asura (demon)
<>named S4u1rapadma attacked devaloka. A fierce battle
<>ensued between the gods and asuras. In the course of
<>this battle, Jayanta, Indra's son, was hit by an arrow
<>and at once he fell dead. Enraged by this Aira1vata
<>rushed at S4u1rapadma's chariot and shattered it to
<>pieces. Aira1vata then attacked S4u1rapadma who broke his
<>tusks and hurled him down to the earth. Aira1vata lay
<>paralysed for a long time; then he got up, retired to a
<>forest and prayed to Lord S4iva. With the grace of S4iva
<>Aira1vata regained his lost tusks and was able to return
<>to devaloka.
<NI>7) {%Other details about Aira1vata.%} (1) There is a belief
<>that Aira1vata is one of the eight elephants guarding the
<>eight zones of the universe. These eight elephants are
<>called the As2t2adiggajas. Aira1vata is supposed to guard
<>the eastern zone. (Chapter 66, A1di Parva, Maha1-
<>bha1rata).
<NI>(2) Aira1vata and three other diggajas are supposed to
<>reside in Pus2kara Island. (Chapter 12, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AIRA1VATA II. Name of a serpent born to Kas4yapa and
<>his wife Kadru. This is mentioned in S4loka 5, Chapter
<>35, A1di Parva of the Maha1bha1rata. Arjuna's father-in-
<>law and Ulu1pi's father, Kauravya belonged to the family
<>of this serpent. (See S4loka 18, Chapter 213, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>AIRA1VATA. An asura who was killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>(See Chapter 38, Sabha1 Parva, Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>AIRA1VATAGHAT2T2A. Name of a place near the sea-
<>shore, lying to the north of the mountain, S4r2n3gava1n.
<>(See S4loka 37, Chapter 6, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>AIS2I1KAM. Name of a small division of a parva of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>AITAREYA I. A great scholar with profound knowledge
<>of the Vedas. Being a non-brahmin he was not able to
<>learn the Vedas from a guru. In spite of this handicap
<>he acquired considerable scholarship and wrote a learned
<>commentary on the R2gveda. This commentary ranks
<>high among the various commentaries on the Vedas.
<HI>AITAREYA II. Son of Sage, Ma1n2d2uki by his first wife,
<>Itara1. Being the son of Itara1 he came to be called Aita-
<>reya. As a boy he was very pious and used to chant the
<>mantra “Namo Bhagavate Va1sudeva1ya” frequently. But
<>he was a shy and silent boy and his father mistook his
<>silence to be a sign of stupidity. Dissatisfied with him and
<>being desirous of having learned sons, Ma1n2d2uki married
<>another woman named Pin3ga1 and had four sons by her
<>who all became very learned. Once Itara1 called her
<>son and told him that his father regarded him as an
<>unworthy son and was often twitting her using insulting
<>words for having given birth to so unworthy a son. She
<>then told him of her resolve to sacrifice her life. Aita-
<>reya then made an enlightening discourse to her and
<>dissuaded her from her determination to commit suicide.
<>Some time later Lord Vis2n2u appeared before them and
<>blessed the mother and son. On the advice of Vis2n2u
<>Aitareya participated in the yajn5a conducted by Hari- [Page019-b+ 65]
<>medhya at Kot2iti1rtha and there he made a learned
<>speech on the Vedas. Harimedhya was so pleased with
<>him that he gave his daughter in marriage to him.
<>(See Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapters 1, 2 and 42).
<HI>AJA I. A king of the Solar dynasty.

<>Aja never used to take meat.
<HI>AJA II. Among the different kinds of R2s2is mentioned by
<>Yudhis2t2hira, we find a class of R2s2is called Ajas. (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 26). These Ajas had attained
<>Heaven by Sva1dhya1ya (self discipline) alone.
<HI>AJA III. King Jahnu had a son named Aja. Us4ika was
<>the son of this Aja. King Us4ika prayed to Indra for a
<>son. Indra himself was born as the son of Us4ika assum-
<>ing the name Ga1dhi. Satyavati1 was born as the daughter
<>of Ga1dhi. She was married to R2ci1ka. Paras4ura1ma's
<>father, Jamadagni was the son of R2ci1ka. (M.B., S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 49).
<HI>AJA IV. By the grace of S4iva Surabhi1 was able to purify

<HI>AJAGAVA. Ajagava is a bow made of the horns of a
<>goat and a cow. Brahmins tormented the right hand of
<>the King Vena. From it the brilliant Pr2thu who shone
<>brightly like the God Agni, appeared as the son of Vena.
<>At that time the very first Ajagava bow, divine arrows
<>and armours dropped from the sky. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,

<>Gardda-Suketu and Br2hatks2etra were Bharata's sons.
<>Br2hatks2etra had four children, who were: Nara, Maha1-
<>vi1ra, Garga and Hasti. Of them Hasti had three sons:

<HI>AJAMI1D2HA II. We come across another Ajami1d2ha also
<>in the Lunar Dynasty. He married Sudeva1, daughter
<>of Vikan2t2ha a King of the Lunar Dynasty. This Aja-
<>mi1d2ha had 2400 children by his four wives, Kaikeyi1,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1, Vis4a1la1 and R2ks2a1. Of them Sam3varan2a
<>married Tapati1, the daughter of Vivasva1n. See Tapati1
<>Sam3varan2a. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verses
<>35-37).
<HI>AJA1MILA. Aja1mila's story is given in the Bha1gavata as
<>an example to illustrate that even the most wicked person
<>can attain Vis2n2upa1da (Salvation).
<NI>Aja1mila was a Brahmin who was once sent by his
<>father to the jungle to fetch samit (leaves and twigs
<>to make the sacrificial fire). Aja1mila met there a beauti-
<>ful S4u1dra woman. Forgetting everything, the Brahmin
<>made her his wife and children were born to them.
<>When that Brahmin, who was the very embodiment of
<>all vices, reached the age of eightyseven, the time came
<>for him to die. Yamadu1tas (Agents of Yama--the god
<>of death) had arrived. The frightened Aja1mila shouted
<>loudly the name of his eldest son, ‘Na1ra1yan2a’. Hearing
<>the repeated call of his name ‘Na1ra1yan2a’, Maha1vis2n2u
<>appeared there and dismissed the agents of Yama. From
<>that day Aja1mila became a devotee of Vis2n2u and did
<>penance on the bank of the Ganges and after some years
<>attained salvation. (Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha,
<>Chapter 1). [Page020-b+ 65]
<HI>AJAMUKHA (AJAVAKTRA). He was one of the
<>soldiers in Skanda's army. (M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter

<>Asuras one of the routed Asuras had fled to Pa1ta1la (Hell).
<>Surasa1 was his daughter. Brahma1's grandson, Kas4yapa
<>married Surasa1. She gave birth to six children--S4u1rapa-
<>dma1, Sim3hika1, Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura, Aja1mukhi1, and
<>Gomukha. The Asura woman Aja1mukhi1 is one of them.
<NI>3) {%Chief events.%} (1) {%Marriage with Durva1sas.%} Once
<>S4u1rapadma1 called his two brothers, Sim3havaktra and
<>Ta1raka1sura and ordered them to set up two cities, one
<>to the north and the other to the south, of Maha1meru.
<>In obedience to his elder brother, Ta1raka1sura started
<>with one half of the army and set up a city to the south
<>of Maha1meru. That city was named Ma1ya1pura. Sim3ha-
<>vaktra lived in the city on the northern side of Maha1-
<>meru. Their sister Aja1mukhi1 went about enticing men to
<>satisfy her lustful passion. Once, in the course of her
<>wanderings, she met Durva1sas in the Hima1layan valley.
<>They fell in love and even married. The two Asuras,
<>Ilvala and Va1ta1pi were born from their union. They
<>insisted on sharing their father's achievements between

<>hands of Agastya. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Asura Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(2) {%The cutting off of Aja1mukhi1's hands.%} While wandering
<>with her lustful passion, Aja1mukhi1 once went to the S4iva
<>temple at Ka1s4i. There she happened to meet Indra's
<>wife, S4aci1devi1. In order to give her to her brother,
<>S4u1rapadma1, Aja1mukhi1 caught hold of S4aci1devi1. S4aci1-
<>devi1 screamed aloud. Suddenly S4iva appeared there
<>with His sword. Even then Aja1mukhi1 refused to release
<>S4aci1devi1. S4iva rescued Indra1n2i1 (S4aci1devi1) by cutting off
<>Aja1mukhi1's hands. Hearing this, S4u1rapadma1 sent his
<>army and imprisoned the Devas. The imprisoend
<>Brahma1 at the instance of S4u1rapadma1, restored Aja-
<>mukhi1's hands. S4u1rapadma1's son, Bha1nugopa fought
<>against the remaining Devas and defeated them. (Skanda

<HI>AJARA. Tapantaka, the minister of King Vatsa, told
<>him the story of a man named Ajara to illustrate the law
<>that all people will have to suffer the consequences of
<>their actions in a previous birth. The story is given be-
<>low:--
<NI>Once upon a time, there lived a King named Vinayas4i1la
<>in Vila1sapura, in the city of S4ri1kan2t2hanagari1. After
<>some years, the King was affected by wrinkles of old age.
<>A physician named Tarun2acandra came to the palace to
<>cure the King of his wrinkles. “The King should remain
<>alone in the interior of the earth for full eight months.
<>He has to use a medicine while remaining there. It
<>should not even be seen by anyone else. I myself am to
<>administer the medicine”--This was the physician's
<>prescription. The King agreed. Accordingly the King [Page021-a+ 65]
<>and the physician spent six months in the interior of the
<>earth. After that the physician, after a search, found a
<>man who exactly resembled the King and brought him
<>to the interior of the earth. After two more months,
<>the physician murdered the King and came out with the
<>new man. The people welcomed him with honour as
<>the King who was cured of his wrinkles. This man was
<>Ajara. After some time, the physician approached
<>Ajara for his reward. Ajara said: “It is by my Karma-
<>phala (consequence of my actions in my previous birth)
<>that I have become King. In my previous birth I re-
<>nounced my body after doing penance. According to the
<>boon which God gave me on that occasion, I have be-
<>come King in my present birth”. The physician returned
<>empty-handed. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Ratnaprabha1-
<>lam3baka, 6th Taran3ga).
<HI>AJAVINDU. He was a King, born in the dynasty of the
<>Suvi1ras. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74, Verse 14).
<HI>AJEYA. He was a King in ancient Bha1rata. Ajeya's name
<>is found among the names of the Kings mentioned by
<>San5jaya to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. All these Kings were mighty
<>and generous rulers who were the recipients of divine
<>arrows. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 234).
<HI>AJI1GARTA (R2CI1KA). He was a greedy Brahmin. (See
<HI>R2CI1KA I
<NI>King Haris4candra who was distressed by having no
<>children, propitiated god Varun2a. Varun2a blessed
<>him saying that a son would be born to him. But
<>the condition was that the child should be sacrificed
<>to Varun2a. When the child was born, Haris4candra did
<>not like to sacrifice the boy. The sage Vis4va1mitra suggest-
<>ed that instead of sacrificing his own son it would be
<>enough if he bought another boy and sacrificed him.
<>Accordingly, Haris4candra sent his minister to find out
<>and purchase a Brahmin boy for the sacrifice. At that
<>time there lived in Ayodhya1 a greedy Brahmin named
<>Aji1garta. He had three sons. In the course of his search,
<>the minister came across this needy Brahmin and asked
<>him whether he was willing to sell one of his three sons.
<>He continued: “Why should you be in this wretched
<>state of poverty and misery? Sell one of your sons and
<>you will get 100 cows as the price”. The minister's
<>words and the price offered for the son made a deep
<>impression on the Brahmin's mind. He thought:
<>“It is impossible for me to earn 100 cows. Even if it were
<>possible how long would it take? If I sell him I shall
<>get hundred cows at once. What a lucky chance! The
<>loss of a son is nothing.” So thinking, he sold his son
<>S4unas4s4epha. (For the rest of the story, see the word
<>“S4unas4s4epha”. Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandhas 7, 8).

<>He was killed in a battle and the King became much
<>depressed. Na1rada consoled him with other stories and

<>mother of Akrodha, was the daughter of Pr2thus4rava1.
<>(S4loka 21, Chapter 95, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>have gone to heaven after completing the fourth a1s4rama
<>of life namely, Sannya1sa. The Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava
<>battle was over. As the eldest, Dharmaputra performed
<>obsequies to all those of his kith and kin dead in the war.
<>He was then met by many sages including Vya1sa and
<>Na1rada who comforted him in his bereavement. When
<>Dharmaputra later met Bhi1s2ma the latter among many
<>other stories told him the story of Akr2tas4rama also.
<>(S4loka 17, Chapter 244, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKR2TAVRANA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} Akr2tavran2a was a great sage of
<>erudition and was a disciple of Paras4ura1ma. He is ex-
<>tolled in the Pura1n2as and it is said that Su1ta who recited
<>first the story of Maha1bha1rata to an assembly of sages in
<>the forest of Naimis4a was a disciple of Akr2tavran2a.
<>(Skandha 12 of Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) {%How he became a disciple of Paras4ura1ma.%} Para ura1ma
<>was returning after obtaining arrows from Lord S4iva
<>after pleasing him by fierce penance. He was walking
<>briskly through the dense forests anxious to be at the side
<>of his preceptors to get their blessings. As he passed a
<>great cave he heard a moan and on getting to the site
<>of the sound found a brahmin boy being attacked by a
<>tiger. The tiger immediately fell dead by an arrow from [Page022-a+ 65]
<>Paras4ura1ma. Lo! the tiger turned into a gandharva
<>freed now from a curse because of which he was for years
<>living as a tiger. The gandharva bowed down respect-
<>fully and thanked the sage for giving him relief and left
<>the place. The brahmin boy fell down at the feet of
<>Paras4ura1ma and said, “Great Lord, because of you I
<>have now become Akr2tavran2a meaning one who has not
<>received any wound. (Akr2ta=not having secured.
<>Vran2a=wound). I shall, therefore, be your disciple for-
<>ever hereafter”. From that day onwards he never left
<>Paras4ura1ma but followed him as his disciple.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) In the story of Maha1bha1rata we
<>find Akr2tavran2a in several different contexts appearing
<>on behalf of Paras4ura1ma. It was Akr2tavran2a who told
<>Dharmaputra the life and exploits of Paras4ura1ma during
<>the exile of the Pa1n2d2avas in the forests. (Chapters 115 to
<>117, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(2) In Chapter 83 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<>Akr2tavran2a meeting S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a while the latter was going
<>to Hastina1pura.
<NI>(3) In Chapter 173 of Udyoga Parva we read about
<>Akr2tavran2a detailing the history of the Kaurava dynasty
<>to Duryodhana.
<NI>(4) Akr2tavran2a has played a very important role in the
<>story of Amba1, daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1. Amba1
<>along with her two sisters, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1, were
<>brought down to Hastina1pura by Bhi1s2ma for his brother
<>Vicitravi1rya to marry. But on knowing that Amba1 had
<>mentally chosen Sa1lva as her husband, Bhi1s2ma allowed
<>her to go back to Sa1lva. But on her return to Sa1lva he
<>refused to accept her and she came back to Hastina1pura.
<>Bhi1s2ma then requested Vicitravi1rya to accept her as
<>his wife which, unfortunately, Vicitravi1rya also refused
<>to do. Amba1 then turned to Bhi1s2ma and besought him
<>to marry her which, much to his regret, he could not do
<>because of his vow of celibacy. Thus forsaken by all,
<>all her sweetness turned into bitter hatred towards
<>Bhi1s2ma and she remained alive thereafter only to kill
<>Bhi1s2ma. But even the foremost of warriors were not
<>willing to antagonise Bhi1s2ma and so her appeal to help
<>was not heeded by any. It was then that Hotrava1ha her
<>grandfather on the maternal side met her and directed
<>her to Paras4ura1ma. When she went to Paras4ura1ma it
<>was Akr2tavran2a who received her and on hearing her
<>sorrowful tale encouraged her to seek vengeance on
<>Bhi1s2ma. Again it was he who persuaded Paras4ura1ma to
<>champion her cause and go for a fight against Bhi1s2ma.
<>During the fight Akr2tavran2a acted as charioteer to
<>Paras4ura1ma. (S4loka 9, Chapter 179, Udyoga Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(5) Akr2tavran2a was one of the many sages who were
<>lying on a bed of arrows during the great Kuruks2etra
<>battle. (S4loka 8, Chapter 26, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKRU1RA.

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4vaphalka of the Vr2s2n2i dynasty married
<>Nandini1, daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1 and Akru1ra was
<>born to them. Akru1ra was an uncle of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a but is
<>respected more as a worshipper of Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) He became famous as a commander
<>of the Ya1dava army. (Chapter 220 of A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>Akru1ra was partaking in the same. (S4loka 10, Chapter
<>218, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<NI>(5) Akru1ra came to the country called Upaplavya for
<>attending the marriage of Abhimanyu. (S4loka 22, Chap-
<>ter 72, Vira1t2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(6) Akru1ra and A1huka always quarrelled with each
<>other both alleging that the other sided with the opposite
<>camp of Kr2s2n2a. (S4lokas 9 to 11, Chapter 81, S4a1nti
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(7) Kam3sa planning to kill Balabhadrara1ma and S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a conducted a festival called Ca1papu1ja1 (worship
<>of the bow). It was Akru1ra whom Kam3sa sent to bring
<>Balabhadra and Kr2s2n2a for the festival. Akru1ra under-
<>stood the plot, informed Kr2s2n2a about it and also advised
<>Kr2s2n2a to kill Kam3sa. (Das4ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>(8) Akru1ra fought against Jara1sandha on the side of
<>Kr2s2n2a. (Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>(9) On another occasion Kr2s2n2a, Balabhadra and Ud-

<>Kunti1 and the Pa1n2d2avas. Akru1ra met his sister Kunti1
<>and talked to her for a long time and also met Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and talked to him after which he returned to
<>Dva1raka1. (Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>(10) Akru1ra went to Hastina1pura as a messenger from
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Refer sub-para 3 of para 13 under Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>4) {%Domestic life.%} Akru1ra married Sutanu1, daughter of

<HI>AKS2A I. (Aks2akuma1ra).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended in order from Vis2n2u as
<>follows: Brahma1-Pulastya-Vis4ravas-Ra1van2a-Aks2a.
<>(Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three sons were born to Ra1van2a, King of the
<>demons, by his wife Mandodari1. They were Megha-
<>na1da, Atika1ya and Aks2akuma1ra. Aks2akuma1ra was a
<>redoubtable hero and a fierce fighter but was killed by
<>Hanu1ma1n in Lan3ka1. (Sarga 47, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>AKS2A II. We find another warrior of this name among
<>the soldiers who came to help Skanda in the Kaurava-
<>Pa1n2d2ava battle. (S4loka 58, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AKS2AHR2DAYA. A sacred chant or mantra. When
<>Nala was roaming about in the forests after his separa-
<>tion from Damayanti1 he happened to save the cobra,
<>Ka1rkot2aka, from a wild fire. But in return the snake bit
<>him and made him as black as clouds. He then advised
<>Nala to go to the palace of King R2tuparn2a where the [Page023-a+ 65]
<>cobra said, Nala would be taught the secret mantra of
<>Aks2ahr2daya by the King.
<NI>One who knows this sacred chant can find out all secrets
<>of a game of dice and can count within no time the
<>number of leaves, fruits and flowers on a tree. Nala went
<>to Rt2uparn2a and stayed with him. While living there a
<>brahmin named Sudeva came to R2tuparn2a and informed
<>him that Damayanti1 was going to marry again. R2tuparn2a
<>immediately started for Vidarbha taking Nala as his
<>charioteer. The chariot driven by Nala flew like a wind
<>and on the way when R2tuparn2a's handkerchief fell down
<>and he requested Nala to stop the chariot. Nala informed
<>him that by the time the request was made they had
<>travelled already one yojana. As they proceeded they
<>saw a huge tree full of leaves and fruits. R2tuparn2a at a
<>glance told Nala that the tree contained five crores of
<>leaves and two thousand nine hund2red and five fruits.
<>Nala was surprised. Then they understood that Nala
<>was able to drive the chariot so quickly because of his
<>knowledge of the sacred chant As4vahr2daya and that
<>R2tuparn2a was able to count the leaves and fruits be-
<>cause of his knowledge of the chant Aks2ahr2daya. They
<>taught each other the sacred mantras. Because of this
<>Aks2ahr2daya Nala was able to win the game of dice the
<>second time and regain his kingdom. (Chapter 72,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>AKS2AMA1LA1 (ARUNDHATI1). See under Arundhati1.
<HI>AKS2APRAPATANA. A particular place in the country
<>of A1nartta. At this place S4ri1 Kr2sn2a killed two demons
<>named Gopati and Ta1laketu. (S4loka 29, Chapter 38,
<>Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AKS2ARAPURUS2A. When all was set for the Kuru-
<>ks2etra battle Arjuna showed signs of weakness and hesi-
<>tated to proceed for a fight. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a then through the
<>famous Gi1ta1 enunciated a philosophy of life during the
<>course of which he speaks about the two purus2as, Ks2ara
<>and Aksara. All that we see in this world and enjoy are
<>Ks2ara and the power behind all of them is Aks2ara.
<>God is one who transcends the aspects Ks2ara and Aks2ara
<>and stands as the root cause of all life. (S4lokas 16 to 19,
<>Chapter 39, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.)
<HI>AKSASU1TRA1. She was the wife of the sage A1pastamba.
<>She was a very chaste woman. (See under A1pastamba).
<HI>AKS2AUHIN2I1. A big division of an army. It is described
<>in the Verses 19 to 26 in the 2nd Chapter of A1di Parva of
<>the Malayalam Maha1bha1rata. It says thus: One chariot,
<>one elephant, three horses and five soldiers constitute
<>what is termed a Patti. Three such pattis make one Sena1-
<>mukha and three such sena1mukhas make one Gulma.
<>Three gulmas make one Gan2a and three such gan2as
<>make one Va1hini1. Three such va1hini1s make one Pr2tana1.
<>An Aks2auhin2i1 contains 21870 chariots, an equal number
<>of elephants, 65160 horses and 109350 soldiers.
<HI>AKS2AYAPA1TRA. This is a copper vessel given to
<>Dharmaputra by Su1rya (Sun). To destroy the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>Duryodhana kept them in a palace made of lac. They
<>escaped from there and passing through dense forests
<>crossed the river Ganges and reached the Kingdom of
<>Pa1n5ca1la where they married the King's daughter,
<>Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1). On their way they killed two demons
<>called Hidimba and Baka. When they were living hap-
<>pily at Indraprastha the jealous Duryodhana defeated
<>them in a game of dice by foul play and sent them for a
<>period of twelve years to the forests. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>found it impossible to feed the innumerable subjects who [Page023-b+ 65]
<>faithfully followed them to the forest. Dharmaputra
<>then prayed to the God, Su1rya and he appeared before
<>him and gave him this Aks2aya Pa1tra (Aks2aya=never
<>getting empty, Pa1tra=pot). Everyday this pot never
<>got empty till the meals of Pa1n5ca1li1 were over. (Chapter
<>3, Vana Parva, M.B.). See also under Duryodhana,
<>Para 12.
<HI>AKS2AYAVAT2A. A sacred lake. When the Pa1n2d2avas
<>during their exile went to Pulastya1s4rama sage Pulastya
<>gave a description of all the sacred lakes in India. He
<>says, “After reaching Ma1rkan2d2eya lake you should visit
<>the meeting place of the rivers Gan3ga1 and Gomati1.
<>Then when you reach Gaya1 you will find there a lake
<>called Aks2ayavat2a. If you bathe in that lake you will
<>get salvation”. In the Navama Skandha of Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata you find the following about Aks2ayavat2a: “Pus2pa-
<>bhadra1 is one of the famous sacred rivers in India. This
<>river starts from the Hima1layas with the name S4ara1vati1
<>and flowing for 500 yojanas (One yojanam is equal
<>to about 8 miles) on the left side of river Gomati1 reaches
<>the western ocean. There is an a1s4rama called Aks2aya-
<>vat2a on the shores of this beautiful river which always
<>carries crystal clear water. The a1s4rama got that name
<>because of a big banyan tree standing near it. Kapila,
<>the great sage, did penance sitting here for a long time.
<>Lord S4iva, Bhadraka1li1 and Skanda used to come and
<>sit underneath this banyan tree.
<HI>AKS2I1N2A. He was the son of Vis4va1mitra. (S4loka 50,
<>Chapter 14, Anus4a1sana Parva. For more details see
<>under Vis4va1mitra).
<HI>AKU1PA1RA.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} There is a lake in the Hima1-
<>layas called Indradyumna. Aku1pa1ra is a tortoise living
<>in it. There is also a statement that this is the A1di-
<>Ku1rma (second of the ten incarnations of God). A
<>description of Aku1pa1ra is found in Chapter 199 of Vana
<>Parva in Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>2) {%Ciran5ji1vi1 (One who has no death).%} When the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas were in exile in the forests sage Ma1rkan2d2eya tells
<>many stories to Dharmaputra to console him in his sad
<>plight. The Pa1n2d2avas asked Ma1rkan2d2eya whether he
<>knew of anybody living before him. Then the sage said,
<>“In times of old Indradyumna an ascetic King (Ra1jars2i)
<>fell down from heaven when he fell short of his accumu-
<>lated ‘Pun2ya’. Sorrowfully he came to me and asked me
<>whether I knew him. I replied in the negative adding
<>that perhaps Pra1vi1rakarn2a an owl living on the top of
<>the Hima1layas might know him since he was older
<>than me. At once Indradyumna became a horse and
<>taking me on its back approached the owl living in the
<>Hima1layas. The owl also could not remember Indra-
<>dyumna but directed him to a stork named Na1d2i1jam3gha
<>who was older than the owl. The Ascetic king took me
<>then to the Indradyumna lake where the stork lived.
<>The stork also could not find the identity of Indra-
<>dyumna. Perhaps he said that a tortoise of name Aku1-
<>pa1ra living in that same lake might know him. We then
<>approached the tortoise and enquired whether he knew
<>Indradyumna. The tortoise sat in meditation for some
<>time and then weeping profusely and shaking like a leaf
<>stood bowing respectfully and said, “How can I remain
<>without knowing him? There are several monuments
<>of the useful work done by him here. This very lake is of
<>his making. This came into existence by the march of
<>the cows he gave away to the people”. The moment [Page024-a+ 64]
<>the tortoise finished speaking a chariot appeared from
<>heaven to take the King away. The King after leaving
<>me and the owl in their proper places ascended to heaven
<>in the chariot.
<HI>ALAGHU. A son born to Vasis2t2ha by U1rjja1. Ra1ja
<>(Rajas) Ga1tra, Urdhvaba1hu, Savana, S4ukra and
<>Sutapas, who were great hermits, were brothers of
<>Alaghu, who has another name ‘Alagha’. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 20).
<HI>ALAKA1. The city of Kubera.
<HI>ALAKANANDA1. River Gan3ga1 of devaloka. The river
<>gan3ga1 of the earth when it flows through devaloka is
<>called Alakananda1 and is called Vaitaran2i1 when it flows
<>through Pitr2loka (nether world). Kr2s2n2advaipa1yana
<>(Vya1sa) declares that Deva Gan3ga1 with crystal pure
<>water flowing in devaloka under the name Alakananda1
<>and Vaitaran2i1 of the nether world, a terror to sinners,
<>are the same as the Gan3ga1 of the earth. (S4lokas 21 and
<>22, Chapter 170, Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, A.P.).
<NI>Starting from Vis2n2upa1da Alakananda1 flows through
<>Devaya1na which blazes with the splendour of a crore of
<>beautiful many-storeyed buildings. Flowing from there
<>to Candraman2d2ala (moon) and flooding it completely
<>flows down to Brahmaloka. From there it divides into
<>four rivulets and flows to the four different sides with
<>the names Si1ta1, Caks2us, Alakananda1 and Bhadra1. Of
<>these Si1ta1 falls on the thickly wooded mountain tops of
<>Maha1meru and flowing from there through Gandha-
<>ma1dana by the side of Bhadra1s4vavars2a falls down in the
<>eastern ocean. Caks2us falls on the top of Ma1lyava1n
<>mountain and flowing through Ketuma1la falls down in
<>the western ocean. The most sacred of the group,
<>Alakananda1, falls on the mountain of Hemaku1t2a and
<>from there flows through Bha1ratavars2a and falls down
<>in the southern ocean. The fourth, Bhadra1, falling on
<>the top of the Mountain, Sr2n3gava1n flows to the northern
<>ocean. Of these the most sacred is Alakananda1 which
<>flows through Bha1ratavars2a and it is believed that even
<>those who think of taking a bath in that will acquire the
<>benefit of performing ya1gas like As4vamedha and Ra1ja-
<>su1ya. (Eighth Skandha of S4ri1 Maha1devi1bha1gavata).
<HI>ALAMBALA. A giant who used to eat human flesh.
<>This cannibal was the son of Jat2a1sura. This asura
<>(Alambala) fought on the side of the Kauravas in the
<>Kuruks2etra battle because Bhi1masena had killed his
<>father, Jat2a1sura. In the battle, Ghat2otkaca cut off the
<>head of this mighty warrior and magician and threw his
<>head into the war-chariot of Duryodhana. (M.B., Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 149).
<HI>ALAMBATI1RTHA. A holy place where there was a
<>sacred bath. Garud2a, when he went to devaloka (the
<>realm of the gods) to bring Amr2tam (ambrosia) took
<>rest in this holy place. (See under the word Garud2a.
<>Also M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 39, Stanza 39).
<HI>ALAMBUS2A I. Son of the giant R2s2yas4r2n3ga. He had
<>fought on the side of the Kauravas. (M.B., Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 167, Stanza 33). There was a combat between
<>Alambus2a and Ghat2otkaca, on the first day of the battle
<>of Kuruks2etra.
<NI>“Alambus2a shot ninety sharpened pointed arrows at the

<HI>ALAMBUS2A1. A celestial woman born to Kas4yapa by

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Begins from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order: Brahma1-Kas4yapa-Alambus2a1.
<NI>2) {%How she enticed the hermit Dadhi1ca.%} In days of yore
<>there was an ascetic named Dadhi1ca. He began doing
<>tapas on the bank of the river Sarasvati1. Indra was in
<>consternation. Indra sent this celestial maid Alambus2a1
<>to entice the hermit. When the ascetic got down to the
<>river, Alambus2a1 approached him with enticing actions
<>and expressions. When the hermit saw her he became
<>passionate and he had seminal flow. The sperm fell
<>into the river. The river became pregnant and delivered
<>a child in due course. He was called Sa1rasvata.
<NI>Alambus2a1 brought the child before Dadhi1ca, who blessed
<>the child and said that there would be a drought in the
<>country continuously for twelve years and that at that
<>juncture Sa1rasvata would recite passages from the
<>Scripture to the Brahmins who had forgotten them. The
<>much pleased Sarasvati1 and Sa1rasvata went back.
<NI>At that time Indra lost his Vajra1yudha (weapon of
<>thunderbolt) somewhere. The Asuras (enemies of
<>Gods) made an onslaught on the gods and their realm.
<>Indra knew that with a weapon made by the bone of
<>Dadhi1ca the Asuras could be destroyed. Indra asked the
<>Gods to bring the bone. They came down to the earth
<>and requested Dadhi1ca to give them a bone. Dadhi1ca
<>giving his bone died and attained heaven. With his
<>bones Indra made a good deal of weapons such as the
<>Vajra1yudha, wheel weapons, maces and sticks and with
<>them Indra slew all the Daityas (Asuras).
<NI>After this there was a great famine in the country. As
<>there was no rain, crops failed and lands became dry and
<>the Brahmins left the country. Sa1rasvata alone remained
<>with his mother. After twelve years the famine and
<>starvation came to an end. By then the Brahmins had
<>forgotten the hymns and mantras of the Vedas. They
<>approached the boy Sa1rasvata and renewed their me-
<>mory. (Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51).
<NI>3) {%Punarjanma (Rebirth).%} Long ago Indra went to
<>Brahma1. There was one Vasu called Vidhu1ma also with
<>Indra. When these two were standing near Brahma1,
<>Alambus2a1 also came there to pay homage to Brahma1.
<>The garments she had on were displaced by wind.
<>Vidhu1ma saw the dazzling beauty of her body and was
<>overpowered by libido. Alambus2a1 who understood
<>this, was filled with passion for him. Brahma1 who saw
<>the changes in them looked at Indra with displeasure.
<>Indra knowing the mind of Brahma1 cursed them: “Both
<>of you who have lost meekness shall become human be- [Page025-a+ 65]
<>ings and then your desire will be fulfilled”. Owing to
<>the curse Vidhu1ma was born as Sahasra1ni1ka, the illus-
<>trious King of Candra vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty) and
<>Alambus2a1 took birth as Mr2ga1vati1, the daughter of King
<>Kr2tavarma1 and his wife Kala1vati1. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Katha1mukhalambaka, Taran3ga 1).
<NI>4) {%The curse of Tilottama1.%} Sahasra1ni1ka the incarnation
<>of Vidhu1ma and Mr2ga1vati1 the incarnation of Alambus2a1
<>fell in love with each other on the earth also. Before
<>the wedding took place Devendra once invited Sahasra1-
<>ni1ka to heaven. He lived there for a time as the guest
<>of the Gods. After having defeated the Asuras it was
<>time for him to return. Indra sent Tilottama1 to keep
<>company. The charioteer was driving. Sahasra1ni1ka
<>immersed in the thought of Mr2ga1vati1 was sitting silent.
<>Tilottama1 said something which the King did not hear.
<>Tilottama1 cursed him that he would be separated for
<>fourteen years from the object about which he was
<>thinking. He was not even aware of the curse.
<NI>5) {%The period of separation.%} The King returned to
<>Kaus4a1mbi his capital city. Without much delay the
<>wedding ceremony also was conducted. She became
<>pregnant. One day she told her lover-husband that she
<>had a desire to dip in a blood pond. The King made a
<>pond and filled it with a solution of La1ks2a1 (wax, when
<>dissolved in water, the water will look like blood) and
<>such other substances. Mr2ga1vati1 was dipping and splash-
<>ing in it when an eagle taking her to be a piece of flesh
<>took her away. At the loss of his wife Sahasra1ni1ka lost
<>his senses and fell down unconscious. Immediately
<>Ma1tali, Indra's charioteer, came down from the realm of
<>Gods and brought the King back to consciousness, and
<>then informing him of the curse of Tilottama1 he returned.
<>Without paying any heed to the consolatory words of
<>his ministers or other inmates of the palace the King
<>went on lamenting and moaning, “ha, my love Mr2ga1-
<>vati1! Where are you now?” and waited for the end of
<>the period of the curse, execrating Tilottama1. Casting
<>Mr2ga1vati1 on the Mountain of the Rising Sun the great
<>bird flew away. The horror-stricken queen, thinking of
<>her present condition cried aloud. A very large mountain
<>snake began to draw near to swallow her. A divine
<>person saved her from that situation and vanished. The
<>unprotected Mr2ga1vati1 decided to commit suicide. It
<>was a forest which abounded in lions, tigers, bears and
<>such other ferocious animals. But none of them came
<>near her; over and above the exertion of carrying, she
<>had to bear the difficulties of her forlorn condition, and
<>she grew weary and worn and became unconscious.
<>Then a hermit boy came there and questioned her who
<>was now lean and ill-dressed, about her condition and
<>consoling her guided her to the hermitage of the great
<>hermit Jamadagni. When she saw the hermit who was
<>as radiant as the Sun, she bowed low before him. “My
<>daughter! Don't fear. You will get a heroic son here who
<>will continue your family. You will be reunited to your
<>husband.” Said the great and noble hermit, who could
<>foresee the future. Somewhat pacified Mr2ga1vati1 lived
<>in that hermitage waiting for reunion with her husband.
<>After some days she gave birth to a son who had all the
<>symptoms of greatness. At the birth of the child Mr2ga1-
<>vati1 heard an unknown voice saying, “This boy would
<>become the great and renowned King Udayana. His son
<>would get the leadership of the Vidya1dharas (the musi-
<>cians of the Gods)”. At this the queen was immensely [Page025-b+ 65]
<>pleased. The boy Udayana grew up in the hermitage,
<>an incarnation of all good qualities. The hermit to whom
<>the past, the present and the future were not obscure,
<>performed the necessary rites and rituals becoming a
<>Ks2atriya boy (Ruling caste) and taught him everything
<>including the Dhanurveda (the Science of Archery).
<>As a token of her intense love for the son, she put a bangle
<>with the name of Sahasra1ni1ka inscribed on the arm of
<>Udayana. One day when Udayana was tramping the
<>forest, he saw a snake-charmer catching a snake. Seeing
<>the beauty of the snake he asked the snake-charmer to let
<>the snake free. But the snake-charmer replied, “Oh
<>Prince, this is my daily bread. I earn my livelihood by
<>exhibiting snakes. My previous snake was dead and it
<>was with the help of a good deal of herbs and spells and
<>incantations that I caught this one”.
<NI>When he heard this Udayana felt pity for him and gave
<>the bangle to the snake-charmer and let the snake free.
<>When the snake-charmer had gone with the bangle,
<>the snake beaming with joy said to Udayana: “I am
<>Vasunemi, the elder brother of Va1suki. I am grateful to
<>you for giving me freedom. I give you this lute producing
<>exquisite notes of music, betels and some tricks to pre-
<>pare never fading garlands and paste to make marks on
<>the forehead. Receive them as my presents”. Udayana
<>accepted the presents with gladness and returned more
<>luminous than before to the hermitage of Jamadagni.
<>The snake-charmer took the bangle, given by Udayana
<>to the bazar for sale. The police caught him and took
<>him before the King, because they saw the name of the
<>King inscribed on the bangle. The King asked him how
<>he got the bangle and the snake-charmer told the King
<>the story from the catching of the snake till he got the
<>bangle. “This is the bangle that I put on the arm of my
<>wife. The boy who gave this bangle to this snake-charmer
<>must be my son.” The King was thinking with sadness,
<>when the King heard a voice from above say, “O King!
<>the period of the curse is over. Your wife and son are
<>in the Mountain of the Rising Sun”. At these words the
<>King felt extreme joy. Somehow or other he spent the
<>rest of the day. Early the next morning the King follow-
<>ed by his army, went to the Mountain of the Rising Sun
<>to bring back his wife and son. They took the snake-
<>charmer to show them the way.
<NI>In due course the King and his train reached the holy
<>hermitage of the eminent hermit Jamadagni. The place
<>was always vibrant with sounds of the repeating and reci-
<>tation of the Holy scriptures and covered with smoke
<>mingled with the fragrance of burning herbs and other
<>oblations burned in the sacrificial fire. The various wild
<>animals which are born enemies of each other got on
<>amicably there. The hermit who was an incarnation of
<>the higher aspirations greeted the King who was the
<>protector of the ascetics, with the hospitality becoming
<>his status. The King who saw Mr2ga1vati1 with their son
<>was overcome with gladness. Their reunion caused a
<>shower of Ambrosia (Amr2ta). The King stood before
<>the hermit with folded arms and bowed head for per-
<>mission to depart. To the King the hermit Jamadagni
<>said: “Oh, King, you are welcome to this hermitage.
<>To those such as you who are of the ‘Rajogun2apradha1na’
<>caste (Ruling race) the peaceful atmosphere of our
<>hermitage may not be appealing to the heart. But a holy
<>hermitage is more respectable than the palace of an
<>Emperor. There is no place for unhappiness here. You [Page026-a+ 63]
<>might have known that the reason for your separation
<>is a curse. When you were returning from heaven with
<>Tilottama1, you were so much engrossed in the thought of
<>Mr2ga1vati1 that you did not pay any heed to the conver-
<>sation of Tilottama1. She was displeased with your be-
<>haviour and cursed you. In future, if ever you happen to
<>get into a position which will cause you mental trouble
<>you can be assured of the presence of this Jamadagni.”
<>The King said, “I am extremely grateful to your Emi-
<>nence for this great boon. I am fully aware of the fact
<>that the presence of the holy hermits who have under
<>their control the eightfold prosperities, is always a
<>harbinger of peace and prosperity. I am very sorry to
<>say that the exigency of my presence at the capital due to
<>the pressure of work in connection with the ruling of the
<>country compels me to cut short my visit to this holy
<>hermitage. I shall be looking forward with pleasure to
<>occasions which will enable me to pay visits to this Holy
<>abode.”
<NI>Much pleased at the speech of the King the hermit said
<>to Mr2ga1vati1: “My daughter! Not only myself, but all
<>the inmates of this hermitage are highly pleased at
<>having got you in our midst for so long. We are sorry to
<>part from you. Now look! the animals of the hermitage
<>are standing round you and shedding tears. Still we are
<>consoled at your reunion with your husband. Naturally
<>you are of a very good character and your life in this
<>hermitage has given you a nice training and so there is no
<>need for any more advice from me at this time.”
<NI>Saying this he drew Udayana to his side, kissed him on
<>his head and said to the King again: “This son is a deco-
<>ration to your dynasty. This handsome boy has been
<>taught everything becoming a royal prince. Let him be a
<>costly gem to you”.
<NI>Thus blessing the boy the hermit led him to the King.
<>The joy at her r{??}nion with husband, her shyness at
<>being near him, her sorrow at having to depart from the
<>hermitage and the surging feeling in her mind--all
<>these made her dumb and so being unable to say any-
<>thing she expressed her love and regard for the hermit
<>whom she loved as her father, by some motions of her
<>body and took leave of him with her son. The blessed
<>King and his train, looking at the men, beasts and birds
<>which accompanied them for a while, took leave of them
<>and proceeded to the capital city. On reaching there
<>the King anointed his son Udayana as King. Sahasra1-
<>nika then went to the Hima1layas to practise ascesis with
<>his wife. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka,
<>Taran3ga 2).

<>with his own name to be living in this world. So he
<>killed the king. After that Vicitravi1rya became king.
<>Bhi1s2ma had to take up the task of arranging a suitable
<>marriage for Vicitravi1rya.
<NI>2) {%The Svayam3vara.%} It was at this time that Bhi1s2ma
<>came to know that the King of Ka1s4i1 was arranging the
<>Svayam3vara of his three daughters, Amba1, Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1. Bhi1s2ma went there and in the presence of all
<>the kings who had assembled there, took the three
<>princesses with him to Hastina1pura. There he made all
<>preparations for the marriage. But as the time for the
<>ceremony approached, the eldest and most beautiful of
<>the princesses, Amba1 went to Bhi1s2ma and said: “I had
<>already made up my mind long ago to marry Sa1lva, the
<>King. Besides, we are deeply in love with each other.
<>Therefore, please consider whether it is proper on the
<>part of a great man like you to force me into another
<>marriage.”
<NI>On hearing this, Bhi1s2ma allowed her to do as she liked.
<>Amba1 then went to King Sa1lva and made an appeal to
<>him to accept her as his wife since they were mutually
<>in love.
<NI>3) {%Sa1lva's rejection.%} To her words Sa1lva replied:
<>“What you have said about our mutual love is true. But
<>it is not right for a man to accept a woman who has been
<>accepted by another. I saw Bhi1s2ma taking you by hand
<>and helping you into his chariot. Therefore go at once
<>to Bhi1s2ma himself and ask him to accept you.” Stunned
<>by his words, she turned away, to go to the forest to do
<>penance.
<NI>4) {%Revenge on Bhi1s2ma.%} In the Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 17, we find that Amba1 had cherished a
<>secret desire to wreak vengeance on Bhi1s2ma. She went to
<>the A1s4rama of S4aikha1vatya Muni in the forest and stayed
<>there for the night. Her wish to do penance was approv-
<>ed by the Muni. On the next day, Amba1's maternal
<>grandfather, Hotrava1hana (Sr2n5jaya) came that way.
<>Hotrava1hana came to know of all her misfortunes. He
<>advised her to inform Paras4ura1ma of all her grievances.
<>Just at that moment Akr2tavran2a, a follower of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma happened to come there. Hotrava1hana introduced
<>Amba1 to Akr2tavran2a. Both Akr2tavran2a and Sr2n5jaya
<>explained all her affairs to Paras4ura1ma. Paras4ura1ma
<>undertook to persuade Bhi1s2ma to accept Amba1 (as his
<>wife). But Paras4ura1ma's proposal was turned down by
<>Bhi1s2ma. A terrible duel took place between them at
<>Kuruks2etra. When the fight reached a critical stage,
<>Na1rada and the gods induced Paras4ura1ma to withdraw
<>from the duel. Thus the fight ended with equal victory
<>to both. Finding that it was not possible to achieve her
<>object through Paras4ura1ma's mediation, Amba1 re-
<>nounced food, sleep etc. and went to the Yamuna1 valley
<>to do penance for six years. (M.B., Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 188). After that for one year she went on a
<>fast, lying under the water in the river Yamuna1. Again
<>for another year she did penance, standing on the tip of
<>the toes and eating only dry leaves. Next, she reduced
<>the sky and earth to flames by doing penance. The
<>goddess Gan3ga1 appeared to her and when she under-
<>stood her plight, she told Amba1 that it was not possible
<>to kill Bhi1s2ma. In her agony and despair, without even
<>drinking water, she wandered about here and there.
<>The goddess Ganga1 cursed her to become a river in the
<>Vatsa country. As a result of the curse, a part of her was
<>turned into the river known as Amba1. [Page028-b+ 65]
<NI>5) {%S4iva's Boon.%} The remaining part of her engaged
<>itself in penance. S4iva appeared to her and told her that
<>in the next birth she would attain masculinity. He added
<>that she would be born in the Drupada dynasty as a
<>great archer under the name of Citrayodhi and kill
<>Bhi1s2ma. Pleased with this prophecy, she took a vow that
<>she would kill Bhi1s2ma and making a pyre, burnt herself
<>to death.
<NI>6) {%Rebirth.%} King Drupada's queen had been in great
<>distress for a long time because she had no children.
<>Drupada propitiated S4iva by worshipping him for an
<>issue. S4iva blessed him and said that a girl would be
<>born to him, but she would be transformed into a boy.
<>In due course, the queen gave birth to a girl, but it was
<>announced that it was a boy. Therefore the child had to
<>be brought up, dressed like a boy. The child became
<>famous under the name of S4ikhan2d2i1. When S4ikhan2d2i1
<>attained youth, Drupada decided to look for a wife for
<>him (her?). Still he was greatly perplexed as to how to
<>find a wife for S4ikhan2d2i1 who was already a youthful
<>virgin! But his wife assured Drupada that Sikhan2d2i1
<>would become a man, according to S4iva's blessing. So,
<>Drupada made a proposal for S4ikhan2d2i1's marriage with
<>the daughter of the King of Das4a1rn2a.
<NI>7) {%S4ikhan2d2i1's Marriage.%} Hiran2yavarn2a, the King of
<>Das4a1rn2a, gave his daughter in marriage to S4ikhan2d2i1.
<>The couple arrived at Ka1mbalyapura. By this time the
<>wife came to know that the “husband” was a woman.
<>She disclosed the secret to her Ladies-in-waiting. They
<>in turn communicated it to the king. Enraged at this,
<>Hiran2yavarn2a sent a messenger to King Drupada to
<>ascertain the truth of the matter. He even began to
<>make preparations for waging a war against Drupada,
<>King of Pan5ca1la. Drupada and his queen were in a fix.
<>At this stage the distressed S4ikhan2d2i1 proceeded to the
<>forest, determined to commit suicide. People were
<>afraid of entering that forest because a Yaks2a named
<>Sthu1n2akarn2a lived there. S4ikhan2d2i1 went to the premises
<>of the Yaks2a and performed certain rites for a number of
<>days. The Yaks2a appeared to her. S4ikhan2d2i1 explained
<>the whole matter to him. They entered into a contract.
<>According to it, they exchanged their sexes--S4ikhan2d2i1
<>receiving the male sex of the Yaks2a and the Yaks2a receiv-
<>ing the female sex of S4ikhan2d2i1. S4ikhan2d2i1 returned home
<>as a man. Drupada repeated with greater force his old
<>plea that his child was a man. Hiran2yavarn2a made a
<>thorough examination of S4ikhan2d2i1 and convinced him-
<>self of the truth. Many years after, Hiran2yavarn2a died.
<NI>8) {%Kubera's Arrival.%} At that time, in the course of his
<>world tour Kubera arrived at the residence of Sthu1n2a-
<>karn2a. The Yaks2a who was in female form, did not
<>come out to receive Kubera. In his anger, Kubera
<>pronounced a curse that the female sex of Sthu1n2akarn2a
<>and the male sex of S4ikhan2d2i1 would continue for ever.
<>The Yaks2a prayed for the lifting of the curse. Kubera
<>released him from the curse by saying that after the
<>death of S4ikhan2d2i1, the Yaks2a would be restored to his
<>own male sex.
<NI>According to the previous agreement, S4ikhan2d2i1 went to
<>Sthu1n2akarn2a's place after the death of Hiran2yavarn2a.
<>But coming to know of all that had happened, he return-
<>ed home. Thus S4ikhan2d2i1 became a man permanently.
<>S4ikhan2d2i1 had received his training in arms under Dron2a1-
<>ca1rya. In the great Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava battle, he became
<>a charioteer. [Page029-a+ 61]
<NI>9) {%S4ikhan2d2i1's Revenge.%} The Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 108, describes Bhi1s2ma's encounter with
<>S4ikhan2d2i1 during the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava battle. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas started the day's battle by keeping S4ikhan2d2i1
<>in the vanguard. Bhi1ma, Arjuna, Abhimanyu and other
<>warriors were giving him support. It was Bhi1s2ma who
<>led the Kaurava forces. Arrows began to fly from both
<>sides. It was the tenth day of the battle and S4ikhan2d2i1
<>shot three arrows aimed at Bhi1s2ma's breast. Bhi1s2ma
<>with a smile of contempt said to S4ikhan2d2i1, “S4ikhan2d2i1!
<>Brahma1 created you as a woman. You may do as you
<>like”. Hearing this taunt, S4ikhan2d2i1 became more in-
<>furiated. Arjuna inspired him with greater courage.
<>After that, keeping S4ikhan2d2i1 in front, Arjuna began to
<>fight with Bhi1s2ma. S4ikhan2d2i1 also showered his arrows
<>on him. Ten of these arrows of S4ikhan2d2i1 hit Bhi1s2ma's
<>breast. Bhi1s2ma disregarded even those arrows. At last
<>he said: “I cannot kill the Pa1n2d2avas because they are
<>invulnerable (avadhya1h2). I cannot kill S4ikhan2d2i1 be-
<>cause he is really a woman and not man. Though I am
<>also invulnerable and cannot be killed in battle, yet
<>today I have to die; the time has come for me to die.”
<>Meanwhile S4ikhan2d2i1 and Arjuna were discharging a
<>continuous and heavy shower of arrows at Bhi1s2ma. At
<>last Bhi1s2ma fell down. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>173).
<HI>AMBA1JANMA. It is a place of sacred bath where the
<>sage Na1rada usually resides. Those who die here will
<>attain salvation (Moks2a) by Na1rada's blessing, accord-
<>ing to M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Verse 81.
<HI>AMBA1LIKA1. (1) The youngest of the three daughters
<>of the King of Ka1s4i1--Amba1, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1.
<>Vicitravi1rya, son of S4antanu married Ambika1 and
<>Amba1lika1. The mother of this princess was Kausalya1.
<NI>2) {%Pa1n2d2u's Mother.%} Vicitravi1rya died before children
<>were born to his wives. To avoid the extinction of the
<>family, Satyavati1, mother of Vicitravi1rya summoned
<>Vya1sa, her other son and asked him to beget a son for
<>Ambika1. Vya1sa obeyed his mother half-heartedly.
<>Ambika1 did not like the dark-complexioned, crudely
<>attired Vya1sa. Still owing to the Mother's pressure, she
<>passively submitted to the act. As a result of their union
<>was born Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who was blind from his birth. The
<>grief-stricken mother called Vya1sa again and asked him
<>to have union with Amba1lika1 this time. As Amba1lika1's
<>face was pale at the time of their union, a child with
<>pale complexion was born to her. He was named Pa1n2d2u.
<>Having thus failed in both attempts, Satyavati1 asked
<>Ambika1 to go to Vya1sa again. At night Ambika1 secretly
<>disguised her waiting-maid and sent her in her own
<>place, to Vya1sa. The waiting-maid experienced exquisite
<>pleasure in Vya1sa's company and as a result a most
<>intelligent son was born to her. It was he who became
<>the renowned Vidura. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 106).
<HI>AMBARI1S2A I. A King of the Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} From Vis2n2u was born in the
<>following order: Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa.-Vivasva1n-
<>Vaivasvatamanu-Iks2va1ku-Vikuks2i-S4as4a1da-Puran5jaya-
<>Kukutstha-Anenas-Pr2thula1s4va-Prasenajit-Yuvana1s4va-
<>Ma1ndha1ta1-Ambari1s2a. Ma1ndha1ta1 had three sons: Amba-
<>ri1s2a, Mucukunda and Purukutsa and fifty daughters. [Page029-b+ 64]
<>The Muni (Sage) Saubhari married the daughters.
<NI>2) {%Ambari1s2a's Ya1ga (sacrifice).%} In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a
<>there is a story of Devendra's theft of the sacrificial
<>cow from Ambari1s2a's ya1gas4a1la1. Devendra could not
<>bear the thought of King Ambari1s2a winning world-
<>renown and glory by performing ya1gas. Therefore Indra
<>stole the sacrificial cow and took it away. The Upa1-
<>dhya1ya (Chief Priest) was alarmed at the disappear-
<>ance of the cow and expressed his opinion to the King
<>that it would be enough to sacrifice a human being in-
<>stead of the cow. The King searched for the cow in all
<>countries, cities and forests. At last he reached the
<>peak of Bhr2gutun3ga where the sage R2ci1ka lived with
<>his wife and children. The King explained to the sage
<>the whole story. He requested him to sell one of his sons
<>in exchange for 100,000 cows. R2ci1ka had three sons.
<>The eldest was his father's favourite and the youngest
<>was the mother's pet. In the end, R2ci1ka sold the second
<>son, S4unas4s4epha in return for 100,000 cows.
<NI>On his return journey with S4unas4s4epha the king rested
<>for a while at Pus2kara Ti1rtha. There S4unas4s4epha
<>happened to meet his uncle Vis4va1mitra and complain-
<>ed to him about his sad plight. S4unas4s4epha's wish was
<>that the king's ya1ga should be performed and at the same
<>time his own life-span should be extended. Vis4va1mitra
<>promised to save S4unas4s4epha. He called Madhu-
<>cchandas and his other sons and said to them: “One of
<>you must take the place of Ambari1s2a's sacrificial cow
<>and save the life of S4unas4s4epha. God will bless you.”
<NI>But none of the sons of Vis4va1mitra was prepared to
<>become the sacrificial cow. Vis4va1mitra uttered a curse
<>on his sons that they would have to spend a thousand
<>years on earth, eating dog-flesh. Then he turned to
<>S4unas4s4epha and told him that if he prayed to the gods
<>at the time of Ambari1s2a's yajn5a, they would save him.
<NI>So S4unas4s4epha went to Ambari1s2a's ya1gas4a1la1. As
<>ordered by the assembled guests, Ambari1s2a bound
<>S4unas4s4epha and had him dressed in blood-red robes,
<>ready for the sacrifice. S4unas4s4epha began to praise and
<>pray to the gods. Soon Indra appeared and blessed him
<>with longevity. He also rewarded Ambari1s2a for his
<>ya1ga. Thus S4unas4s4epha was saved.
<F>*) The story of S4unas4s4epha may be seen with slight variations in the Devi1 Bha1gavata and other Pura1n2as. In those versions, S4unas4s4epha
<>has been described as the sacrificial cow at Haris4candra's ya1ga, and moreover, Aji1garta is referred to as the father of S4unas4s4epha. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 58 gives the same story as in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).</F> (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 61).
<NI>3) {%Ambari1s2a and Durva1sas.%} In Bha1gavata we see a story
<>which describes how the Sudars4ana Cakra which emerg-
<>ed from Ambari1s2a's forehead chased Durva1sas in all
<>the three worlds. Ambari1s2a was a devout worshipper of
<>Vis2n2u. From the very beginning of his reign, peace and
<>prosperity spread all over the country. Maha1vis2n2u
<>who was pleased with the deep piety and devotion of
<>Ambari1s2a appeared to him and bestowed on him the
<>control of his (Vis2n2u's) Sudars4ana Cakra. After that
<>Ambari1s2a started the observance of Eka1das4i1 vrata.
<>The rigour of the observance alarmed even Indra. He
<>decided to obstruct the observance somehow or other. At
<>that time, Durva1sas arrived in devaloka. Indra insti-
<>gated Durva1sas to spoil the Eka1das4i1 observance of
<>Ambari1s2a.
<NI>Durva1sas went to Ambari1s2a's palace. There the King
<>received him with due respect and sent him to the river
<>Ka1lindi1 for his bath and morning rites. Durva1sas went [Page030-a+ 65]
<>for his bath and deliberately stayed away till the con-
<>clusion of Ambari1s2a's Eka1das4i1 observance. At the end
<>of the observance, after feeding the gods with his
<>offerings, Ambari1s2a kept the remaining portion for
<>Durva1sas. After his bath etc., Durva1sas returned, but
<>he was furious when he was offered the leavings of the
<>food of the gods and refused to take any food. In his
<>anger he advanced towards Ambari1s2a. A terrible mons-
<>ter Kr2tya1 emanated from the Mahars2i and was about
<>to destroy Ambari1s2a. Ambari1s2a at once called upon
<>Sudars4ana Cakra, which appeared instantly and after
<>cutting the throat of Kr2tya1, turned against Durva1sas.
<>Terrified by it, Durva1sas began to flee for life. The
<>Cakra pursued him at his heels. Durva1sas went to Indra
<>and sought refuge with him. But the Cakra followed
<>him there. Indra pleaded helplessness. Then the
<>Mahars2i went to Brahma1 and sued for his help. There
<>also the Cakra pursued him. Brahma1 sent him to S4iva.
<>S4iva was also unable to give him shelter. Sudars4ana con-
<>tinued to chase him. Durva1sas then sought shelter with
<>Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u told him plainly that there was
<>no alternative but to go and sue for mercy to Amba-
<>ri1s2a himself and advised him to do so. At last Durva1sas
<>returned to Ambari1s2a and begged his pardon. Ambari1s2a
<>saved him from Sudars4ana Cakra and described to him
<>the glory resulting from the observance of Eka1das4i1
<>vrata. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>4) {%Other Details%} (1) Ambari1s2a performed a ya1ga in

<>Verse 12; Udyoga Parva, Chapter 71, Verse 11).
<HI>AMITRAJIT. A King. In his country there were innu-
<>merable S4iva temples. Na1rada Muni who was delighted
<>by this sight, went to the Palace and said to Amitrajit:
<>“In the city of Campaka1vati1 there is a Gandharva
<>virgin named Malayagandhini1. She has been abducted
<>by Kan3ka1laketu, a Ra1ks2asa. She has promised to marry
<>the person who will rescue her from him. Therefore

<>24).
<HI>AMOGHA1. S4antanu Mahars2i's wife. Once Brahma1
<>visited S4antanu Mahars2i's A1s4rama. As the Mahars2i was [Page031-a+ 65]
<>not at home, it was Amogha1 who received the guest
<>with due reverence. Fascinated by the irresistible
<>charm of Amogha1, Brahma1 had an involuntary emis-
<>sion of seminal fluid. He felt ashamed of his own weak-
<>ness and left the A1s4rama immediately. The Mahars2i
<>who returned to the A1s4rama soon after, came to know
<>from his wife whose semen it was. He asked Amogha1 to
<>accept Brahma Deva's precious semen and not to let it
<>be wasted. Being a devoted wife, she accepted it, but
<>unable to bear the divine pregnancy, she deposited it
<>in the water lying in the valley of the Yugandhara
<>mountain. From that time, it became a place of holy
<>bath, known as Lohita. It was by bathing in this holy
<>water that Paras4ura1ma washed away his sin of annihi-
<>lating the Ks2atriyas. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a, 55).
<HI>AMPIT2T2A. A name for barbers. ‘Ampit2t2a’ is derived from
<>the Sanskrit word “Ambis2t2hah2”. The word Ambis2t2hah2
<>means Physician. In olden days barbers were physicians
<>also. Going about from house to house, they could easily
<>practise both these professions. Since barbers practised
<>physic also they were called Ambis2t2has. Ampit2t2a is a
<>corrupted form of Ambis2t2ha. (Dravidian Philology).
<NI>Barbers sometimes style themselves as “Pandits”. It
<>is on the basis of this that we have today, “All Kerala
<>Pandit Sabha” and other similar names. There is a
<>legend on the basis of which this community has assum-
<>ed the title of “Pandit”.
<NI>Long ago when S4ri1 Buddha was about to go to the
<>forest for performing Tapas, thousands of people flocked
<>together to have his dars4ana. Buddha wished to continue
<>his journey after shaving his head. Buddha asked loudly
<>whether anyone in the crowd was prepared to shave
<>his head. Only a single man came forward cheerfully to
<>do that work. Buddha turned to him and said: “My
<>dear friend, you are the only Pandit in this crowd. You
<>have the wisdom to understand that there is nothing
<>disgraceful in shaving one's head.”
<NI>He shaved Buddha's head. From that day his descen-
<>dants came to be known as “Pandits”.
<HI>AMR2TA1. Daughter of a King of Magadha. She was the
<>wife of Anas4va and mother of Pari1ks2it. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 41).
<HI>AMR2TAM. (See PRA1MR2TAM).
<HI>AMR2TAM. A delicious and precious food obtained from
<>the ocean of Milk when the Devas and Asuras churned
<>it. In Chapter 152 of Agni Pura1n2a, the word “Mr2tam”
<>is defined as wealth received by begging and “Amr2tam”
<>as wealth received without begging, and “Pra1mr2tam”
<>as another kind of wealth obtained without begging.
<NI>1) {%Cause of Ks2i1ra1bdhi-mathanam.%} (Churning of the Sea
<>of Milk)--Once when Mahars2i Durva1sas was travelling
<>through a forest, he met the Apsara1 woman, Menaka1,
<>with a garland of Kalpaka flowers in her hand. The
<>fragrance of the flowers filled the whole forest. Durva1sas
<>approached Menaka1 and requested her to give the gar-
<>land to him. The Vidya1dhari1 (Apsara1 woman) prostrat-
<>ed before the Mahars2i with reverence and presented
<>the garland to him. Wearing that garland on his hair,
<>Durva1sas went to devaloka.
<NI>There he saw Indra riding on his elephant, Aira1vata,
<>accompanied by his retinue of Devas. The Mahars2i took
<>the rare garland from his head and presented it to
<>Indra, the King of Devas. Indra received the garland
<>and placed it on Aira1vata's head. The elephant was
<>attracted by the fragrance of the garland and took it in [Page031-b+ 65]
<>its trunk, examined it by smelling it and then threw it
<>on the ground.
<NI>Durva1sas, who became angry at the way in which his
<>garland was slighted by Indra said to him: “Since
<>you have treated my garland with disrespect, the glory
<>and prosperity of devaloka will perish!” On hearing
<>the curse, Indra alighted from the elephant, frightened.
<>He begged pardon of the Mahars2i. The furious Muni
<>continued: “I am not soft-hearted; nor am I of a for-
<>giving nature. Other Munis may forgive. Remember, I
<>am Durva1sas. You have become so haughty because
<>other Munis like Vasis2t2ha and Gautama have been flat-
<>tering you too much.” Having said this Durva1sas went
<>his way. Indra returned to Amara1vati1.
<NI>From that day the glory of devaloka began to decline.
<>The three worlds became dull. Even the plants and
<>shrubs began to wither. The performance of ya1gas came
<>to an end. The Devas began to be affected by the
<>infirmities of old age. Taking advantage of this situation,
<>the Asuras started preparations for opposing the Devas.
<>Under the oppression of the Asuras, the Devas groaned
<>in distress. Led by Agni Deva they sought refuge under
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 led them to Maha1vis2n2u. They all join-
<>ed in praising Vis2n2u who appeared and told them like
<>this: “O Gods! I shall enhance your glory. Do as I
<>tell you. Along with the Asuras bring all kinds of medi-
<>cinal herbs and deposit them in the ocean of Milk.
<>Obtain Amr2tam from it by churning it with Maha1meru
<>as the churning staff and Va1suki as the rope. The
<>Amr2tam (Amr2ta) which will be produced by churning
<>the Milk sea, will make you strong and deathless. I
<>shall see that the Asuras will share in your troubles but
<>not in enjoying Amr2tam.”
<NI>2) {%Churning of the Milk Sea.%} After Vis2n2u had vanished,
<>the Devas made a treaty with the Asuras and began to
<>work for getting Amr2tam. All of them joined together
<>in bringing various kinds of medicinal herbs and after
<>putting them in the Milk sea which was as clear as the
<>cloudless sky, began to churn it, using Manthara Moun-
<>tain as the churning staff and snake Va1suki as the rope.
<>The party of Devas was posted at the tail-end of Va1suki
<>while the Asuras took their stand at the head. The
<>Asuras became enervated by the fiery breath coming out
<>of Va1suki's mouth. The clouds which were blown by
<>that breath invigorated the Devas.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u transformed himself into a tortoise, and
<>sitting in the middle of the Milk Sea served as the
<>foundation for the Manthara Mountain, the churning
<>staff. Assuming another form, invisible both to Devas
<>and Asuras, Maha1vis2n2u pressed down the Manthara
<>Mountain from above.
<NI>While churning the Milk Sea like this, the first object
<>that rose to the surface was Ka1madhenu. Both Devas
<>and Asuras were strongly attracted towards Ka1madhenu
<>While all were standing spellbound, Va1run2i1devi1 with
<>her enchanting dreamy eyes next appeared on the sur-
<>face. Pa1rija1tam was the third to appear. Fourth, a group
<>of Apsara1 women of marvellous beauty floated up. The
<>Moon appeared as the fifth. S4iva received the Moon.
<>The venom which came out of the Milk Sea as the
<>sixth item, was absorbed by Na1gas. After that arose
<>Bhagava1n Dhanvantari, dressed in pure white robes
<>and carrying a Kaman2d2alu in his hand filled with
<>Amr2tam. All were delighted at this sight. Next Maha1-
<>laks2mi1 made her appearance in all her glory with a [Page032-a+ 65]
<>lotus in her hand and seated in an open lotus flower.
<>Gandharvas sang celestial songs in her presence;
<>Apsara1 women danced. For her bath, the Gan3ga1 river
<>arrived there with her tributaries. The Milk Sea itself
<>took on physical form and offered her a garland of ever-
<>fresh lotus flowers. Brahma1 bedecked her with orna-
<>ments. After that Laks2mi1devi1, fully adorned in all her
<>magnificent jewels, in the presence of all Devas, joined
<>the bosom of Maha1vis2n2u. The Asuras were displeased
<>at it. They snatched the pot of Amr2tam from Dhan-
<>vantari and fled away.
<NI>3) {%How Amr2tam was recovered.%} With the loss of Amr2tam,
<>the Devas were in a fix. They began to consider how
<>the pot of Amr2tam could be recovered. Accordingly
<>Maha1vis2n2u transformed himself into a celestial virgin,
<>Mohini1, of extraordinary beauty. She approached the
<>Asuras as a shy girl. The Asuras were enchanted by
<>her surpassing beauty. They asked her, “Who are
<>you?” Looking down on the ground, Mohini1 replied:
<>“I am the little sister of Dhanvantari. By the time I
<>came out of the Milk Sea, the Devas and Asuras had
<>already gone. Being lonely I am going about in search
<>of a suitable mate.”
<NI>On hearing her words, the Asuras began to make
<>friends with her one by one, determined not to waste
<>this opportunity. They told her that she should distri-
<>bute Amr2tam to all of them and in the end she should
<>marry one of them. Mohini1 agreed, but added: “All
<>of you should close your eyes. I shall serve Amr2tam
<>to all. He who opens his eyes last, must serve Amr2tam
<>to me and he will marry me”.
<NI>All of them accepted this condition. They sat in front
<>of Mohini1 with closed eyes. In a moment Mohini1 left
<>the place with the pot of Amr2tam and went to deva-
<>loka.
<NI>4) {%Ra1hu's neck is cut.%} When the Asuras opened their
<>eyes, Mohini1 was not to be seen. Finding that they
<>were betrayed, they were in great perplexity. All of
<>them pursued Mohini1 to devaloka. Devas had put
<>the Sun and Moon gods on guard duty at the gates
<>of devaloka. At the instance of the Asuras, Ra1hu in
<>disguise entered the divine assembly chamber. The
<>Sun and Moon gods detected him and Vis2n2u with his
<>weapon, Sudars4ana Cakra cut open his neck. Swearing
<>that he would wreak vengeance on the Sun and Moon
<>Ra1hu returned. In the 8th Skandha of Bha1gavata it is
<>said that even now from time to time Ra1hu swallows
<>the Sun and Moon, but they escape through the open
<>gash in his neck and this is known as solar eclipse and
<>lunar eclipse.
<NI>5) {%Defeat of the Asuras.%} Indra and all other gods took
<>Amr2tam. The enraged Asuras attacked the gods, who
<>had gained strength and vigour by taking Amr2tam.
<>The Asuras were driven away in all directions. All the
<>three worlds began to enjoy glory and prosperity again.
<NI>6) {%Kalaku1t2a.%} The story of how the deadly poison,
<>Ka1laku1t2a arose at the churning of the ocean of Milk,
<>is given in M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 18, Verses 42-45,
<>as follows: After many precious things had come up
<>Ka1laku1t2a poison with fumes and flames, appeared on
<>the surface of the ocean. Its strong smell caused a
<>stupor in all the three worlds. Fearing that the world
<>will perish, Brahma1 requested S4iva to swallow that
<>poison. S4iva gulped it down, but stopped it in his
<>throat. From that day he became “Ni1lakan2t2ha”. [Page032-b+ 65]
<NI>7) {%The story of Aira1vata.%} Indra's tusker Aira1vata was
<>responsible for the churning of the ocean of Milk. But
<>in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 18, Verse 42
<>it is said that a white elephant with four tusks arose
<>during the churning of the ocean of Milk and that
<>Devendra caught and tamed it. This is an obvious
<>contradiction. Besides, in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya-
<>ka1n2d2a, 14th Sarga, the wounded Jat2a1yu describing his
<>family history to S4ri1 Ra1ma, gives the following account
<>about the origin of Aira1vata:
<NI>Kas4yapa, one of the Praja1patis, married the eight
<>daughters of Daks2a. One of them named Krodhavas4a1
<>had ten daughters by Kas4yapa. They were: Mr2gi1, Mrga-
<>mada1, Hari, Bhadramada1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li, S4veta1,
<>Surabhi, Surasa1 and Kadru. Of them Bhadramada1
<>gave birth to a daughter, Ira1vati. The tusker Aira1vata
<>is Ira1vati1's son.
<NI>An explanation for this discrepancy may be seen in
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, 3rd Section, Chapter 1. Now six
<>Manvantaras have passed (See ‘MANVANTARA’).
<>This is the seventh Manvantara. Each Manvantara
<>has a new Indra. According to this, different Indras
<>have their own Aira1vatas. This is the only explanation
<>for this apparent contradiction.
<NI>8) {%Amr2tam and Garud2a.%} There is another story about
<>Amr2tam which says that Garud2a once went to deva-
<>loka and brought Amr2tam from there to be given to
<>the Na1gas, but Devendra came down and took it back.
<>This story is given in Maha1bha1rata from Chapter 27
<>onwards. Vinata1, a wife of Kas4yapa gave birth to
<>Garud2a and Kadru and her sister gave birth to the
<>Na1gas. Once there was a dispute between Vinata1 and
<>Kadru. Vinata1 said that the hairs on the tail of Uccai-
<>s4ravas, Devendra's horse, were white but Kadru
<>asserted that they were black. To settle the dispute they
<>made a bet. The condition was that the loser must
<>become the servant maid of the winner. As instructed
<>by Kadru, some of the Na1gas went in advance and
<>hung down from the tail of Uccais4s4ravas, thus giving the
<>false appearance of a tail with black hairs. By this trick
<>Vinata1 lost the bet and had to become Kadru's servant
<>maid. As a result of it, the task of looking after Kadru's
<>children became Garud2a's duty. Kadru told him that
<>if he fetched Amr2tam from devaloka and gave it to the
<>Na1gas, she was prepared to release him from the bond-
<>age. So Garud2a flew up to devaloka, fought with the
<>gods and defeated them. He returned with the pot of
<>Amr2tam and gave it to the Na1gas. The Na1gas went
<>to take their bath after placing the pot on darbha grass
<>spread on the floor. Just then Devendra swooped down
<>and carried away the pot of Amr2tam to devaloka.
<>When the Na1gas returned after their purifying bath,
<>the pot was not to be seen. In their greed they began
<>to lick the darbha grass on which the pot was placed.
<>The sharp edge of the grass cut their tongues into two.
<>This is why the Na1gas (snakes) came to have forked
<>tongues.
<NI>Amr2tam which has been thus recovered after many
<>such adventures, is still preserved carefully in devaloka.

<>Brahma1, Mari1ci and Kas4yapa.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Mari1ci was one of the six sons, all r2s2is, of
<>Brahma1. These six sons, born parthogenetically of
<>Brahma1, were: Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha
<>and Kratu. Mari1ci had a son named Kas4yapa. Kas4yapa
<>married the thirteen daughters of Daks2a. The eldest of

<>(See Chapter 65 of A1di Parva of the Maha1bha1rata).
<NI>3) {%Events.%} The Maha1bha1rata says (S4loka 66, Chapter
<>123) that Am3s4a was present at the time of Arjuna's birth
<>when several devas had come there to see the infant.
<>In S4loka 34, Chapter 45 of S4alya Parva it is said that
<>Am3s4a was present on the occasion of the Abhis2eka of
<>Skandadeva. Am3s4a is said to have presented to Skanda-
<>deva five good warriors: Parigha, Vat2a, Bhi1ma,
<>Dahana and Dahati.
<HI>AM3S4APA1YA. Name of a priest (R2tvik) qualified to

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Sagara, a king of the Su1rya vam3s4a, (mention-
<>ed above) had two wives, Sumati (Vaidarbhi1) and
<>Kes4ini1 (Saiba1) by name. Kes4ini1 gave birth to a son
<>named Asaman5jas. Am3s4uma1n was the son of Asaman5jas

<>Chapter 6 of Karn2a Parva).
<HI>AM3S4UMATI1. The daughter of the Gandharva King
<>named Dramila. Her story is narrated in the S4iva
<>Pura1n2a to illustrate the benefits of performing the Pra-
<>dos2a-Vrata. Su1ta expatiates on the importance and
<>advantages of Prados2a-Vrata to a number of sages
<>in Naim3is4a1ran2ya. King Satyaratha was a scrupulous
<>observer of Prados2a-Vrata. Unfortunately he defaulted
<>in his observance of the Vrata owing to unavoidable
<>circumstances and, after his death, was born again as
<>the King of Vidarbha. He was killed in a battle by the
<>King of Sa1lva and his wife, pregnant at that time, fled
<>to a forest. She gave birth to a son on the bank of a
<>river. Then, when she stepped into the river to drink
<>some water, she was carried away by a crocodile. Pre-
<>sently a Brahmin woman named Us2a1 happened to pass
<>that way with her son named S4ucivrata. Seeing a new-
<>born infant there, that Brahmin woman took him, gave
<>him the name, Dharmagupta and brought him up as
<>her own son. According to the advice of a pious Brah-
<>min named S4a1n2d2ilya, both S4ucivrata and Dharmagupta [Page034-a+ 66]
<>started performing Prados2a-Vrata. Lord S4iva was pleas-
<>ed with them and gave them much wealth. Dharma-
<>gupta happened to meet Am3s4umati1, daughter of the
<>Gandharva King, Dramila, one day in a forest and
<>they fell in love with each other. Dramila came to
<>know of their love and so gave his daughter in marriage
<>to Dharmagupta. As a result of the wealth and power
<>which he had acquired by observing strictly Prados2a-
<>Vrata Dharmagupta was able to return to Vidarbha,
<>defeat King Sa1lva and regain his kingdom from him.
<HI>AMU1RTARAYAS. He was a renowned King of ancient

<>daughters are Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1,
<>Krodhavas4a1, Manu and Anala1. These daughters were [Page034-b+ 66]
<>married to Kas4yapa, son of Mari1ci. Trees, creepers etc.
<>owe their origin to Anala1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya
<>ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>ANALA1 II. Another Anala1 is referred to in Verse 71,
<>Chapter 66 of A1di Parva, in M.B. This Anala1 was the
<>wife of Kas4yapa and a great granddaughter of Krodha-
<>vas4a1, the daughter of Daks2a. Krodhavas4a1 begot S4veta1,
<>and she Surabhi1; Rohin2i1 was the daughter of Surabhi1
<>and Anala1 was Rohin2i1's daughter.
<HI>ANALA1 III. Daughter of Ma1lyava1n born of Sundari1.
<>She was married to Vis4va1vasu. Kumbhi1nasi1 was her
<>daughter. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Uttaraka1n2d2a).
<HI>ANA1LAMBA. A sacred pool. A bath in the pool is as
<>efficacious as the Purus2amedha yajn5a. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 32).
<HI>ANAMITRA I. A king of the Solar dynasty. The
<>A1tmapura1n2a refers to him as the son of Nighna.
<HI>ANAMITRA II. Anamitra, son of Dhr2s2t2a is referred to
<>as a king of the Ya1davas in A1tmapura1n2a.
<HI>ANAMITRA III. One Anamitra, son of Vr2s2n2i is refer-

<HI>ANANTA I. (A1DIS4ES2A).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Maha1vis2n2u begot Brahma1 and he the
<>Praja1patis and Ananta (A1dis4es2a) is one of the Praja1-
<>patis. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 14,
<>Verse 7). Ananta is also referred to as the son of
<>Kas4yapa, one of the Praja1patis born of Kadru1. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 105, Verse 41). Also Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma, elder brother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was a partial incarna-
<>tion of Ananta.
<NI>2) {%Differences with mother.%} Vinata1 and Kadru1 were
<>two wives of Kas4yapa praja1pati. Garud2a was born as
<>Vinata1's son and numerous serpents like Ananta, Va1suki,
<>Taks2aka, Ka1rkkot2aka were sons of Kadru1. Once a
<>controversy developed between Vinata1 and Kadru1, the
<>latter saying that there were a few black hairs on the
<>tail of Aira1vata and the former denying it. It was
<>agreed that she who proved wrong in the argument
<>would become the slave of the other. To prove herself
<>to be right Kadru1, the same night, asked her sons to
<>go and stay suspended in the hairs of Aira1vata's tail.
<>Some of the sons agreed to do so, while her other
<>(prominent) sons like Ananta expressed their disincli
<>nation to do such an unethical act. Kadru1 cursed these
<>disobedient children of hers to die at the serpent yajn5a
<>of Janamejaya, whereupon Ananta and his supporters
<>departed in sorrow. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>3) {%Ananta's new engagement.%} Departing thus from his
<>mother Ananta visited sacred centres like Gandha-
<>ma1dana, Badari1 and practised austerities. And, Brahma
<>appeared before Ananta and asked him not to worry,
<>but to go to the nether world and support the world
<>on his hoods. Brahma1 also told him that Garud2a would
<>render him all help in the new task. Blessed thus by [Page035-a+ 64]
<>Brahma1, Ananta gladly took up the new job. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 24).
<NI>4) Ananta has another abode in the palace of Varun2a
<>in the west. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 110, Verse
<>18).
<NI>5) {%Ananta's prowess.%} About Ananta's prowess Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a has the following to say: At the bottom of
<>Pa1ta1la there is a base (Ta1masic) form of Vis2n2u called
<>A1dis4es2a. Even the Da1navas and the Daityas are not
<>able to describe the attributes of that form. The
<>Siddhas call this A1dis4es2a Ananta who is worshipped
<>by Devas and r2s2is. Ananta has 1000 heads and the
<>Svastika mark which is clearly visible is his ornament.
<>The 1000 gems in his head illuminate all regions, and
<>he renders the Asuras powerless for the good of all the
<>worlds. A1dis4es2a whose eyes ever rotate due to the
<>overflow of his prowess, and who wears blue apparel
<>and garlands of white gems shines forth like another
<>Mount Kaila1sa beautified with garlands of clouds and
<>by the flow of the Gan3ga1. S4ri1 Devi1 and Va1run2i1 Devi1 serve
<>Ananta who holds in one hand a la1m3gala and in the
<>other a mace (mu1sala). As the deluge (end of a yuga
<>Kalpa1nta) approaches Rudra emanates from the faces
<>of Ananta and consumes the three worlds. A1dis4es2a
<>dwells in the nether world wearing the whole earth as
<>a crown. Even the Devas cannot gauge his nature, shape,
<>prowess etc. When he yawns the earth and waters shake
<>and shiver. The Gandharvas, Na1gas, Ca1ran2as etc. fail
<>to understand the real extent of his attributes, and that
<>is why this strange being is called Ananta (endless). It
<>was by worshipping Ananta and by his grace that sage
<>Garga was able to master the sciences of astronomy
<>and causation (nimitta). (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 2,
<>Chapter 5).
<NI>6) {%The land of Ananta.%} Pa1ta1la is Ananta's world, and
<>at its bottom there is a spot called Ananta. That spot
<>is 30000 yojanas in extent, and here lives Ananta. He is
<>known as San3kars2an2a also. He bears the whole nether
<>world as though it were a mustard seed. And, when
<>he thinks of destroying the entire world the Rudra
<>called San3kars2an2a will appear with other Rudras and
<>weapons like tridents (Tris4u1la). Other serpents bow at
<>the feet of Ananta, who is supremely beautiful with
<>divine lustre. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<HI>ANANTA II. A synonym of the Sun God. (M.B., Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 24).

<HI>ANANTA1. Wife of Janamejaya, son of King Pu1ru.
<HI>ANANTA. The abode of Ananta in the nether regions.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Canto 8). (There are certain indica-
<>tions that Ananta refers to Trivandrum, Capital city of
<>the Kerala State. Explanations of words like Svarga,
<>Bhu1mi, Pa1ta1la, Ananta, Deva, Asura, throw much light
<>on this inference).
<HI>ANANTAVIJAYAM. The conch of Dharmaputra. It
<>was blown during the great war. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 15). [Page035-b+ 65]
<HI>ANAPA1YACOLA. A King of the Cola country, 1063-
<>1112. The Tamil poet Sekhilar who composed the
<>twelfth song of the great S4aiva religious book called
<>Tirumurayil was a minister of this King.
<HI>ANARAKATI1RTHA. A sacred pool. Brahma1, along
<>with Vis2n2u and others bathe daily in this sacred pool.
<>Therefore, it is said that the sins of all those who bathe
<>in the pool will be washed off.
<HI>ANARAN2YA (ANA1RAN2YA). A King of the Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 236).
<>For genealogy, see IKS2VA1KU. Anaran2ya was a vege-
<>tarian. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 115, Verse 59).
<>Ra1van2a once attacked his country whom he challenged
<>to a duel. In the duel Anaran2ya died. Before dying he
<>cursed Ra1van2a that he would be killed by Ra1ma, son

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Maha1vis2n2u were born in order
<>Brahma1, Sva1yambhuva Manu, Devahu1ti, Anasu1ya1. To
<>Sva1yambhuva, son of Brahma1, was born by his wife
<>S4ataru1pa1 five children: Utta1napa1da, Priyavrata, A1huti.
<>Devahu1ti and Prasu1ti and Devahu1ti was married to
<>Kardama, son of Brahma1. They begot two daughters,
<>Kala1 and Anasu1ya1. Mari1ci married Kala1 and Atri
<>married Anasu1ya1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 1, Chapter 4).
<NI>2) {%The Tapas4s4akti of Anasu1ya1.%} Once upon a time, rains
<>having failed for ten years the whole world sweated in
<>agony and river Gan3ga1 got dried up. Famine stalked the
<>world. In this dire contingency it was the tapas4s4akti of
<>Anasu1ya1 that made trees bear fruits and Gan3ga1 to flow
<>again. Also, she converted ten days into nights on the
<>request of the Devas.
<NI>During their forest life Ra1ma and Si1ta1 reached the her-
<>mitage of sage Atri, and the sage and Anasu1ya1 treated
<>the guests sumptuously. The above story about the
<>tapas4s4akti of Anasu1ya1 was told then by Atri. The story
<>helped to increase Ra1ma's respect for Anasu1ya1. Anasu1ya1
<>gave Si1ta1 all proper advice. She taught Si1ta1 that abso-
<>lute service to husband is the greatest tapas ordained
<>to women. Anasu1ya1 gave to Si1ta1 a very sacred garland
<>and a sublime gem. And, after that Ra1ma and Si1ta1 left
<>the hermitage. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayodhya1ka1n2d2a,
<>Cantos 117 and 118.).
<NI>3) {%Sons of Anasu1ya1.%} She had three sons: Datta1treya,
<>Durva1sas and Candra. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter
<>10). (The reason for Maha1vis2n2u being born as Datta1t-
<>reya, S4iva as Durva1sas and Brahma1 as Candra to
<>Anasu1ya1 is given under Atri).
<HI>ANAUPAMYA1. Wife of Ba1n2a1sura. Once she developed
<>an amorous interest in Na1rada, which led to some
<>domestic quarrels. (Padma Pura1n2a, A1dika1n2d2a, Chapter
<>14).
<HI>ANAVADYA1. Wife of Kas4yapa, this Apsara1 woman
<>participated in the birthday celebrations of Arjuna.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 62).
<HI>AN2D2A.
<F>*) AN2D2A. The primal seed (An2d2a=egg or seed) from which everything was born.</F> Su1ta, the disciple of Vya1sa said to the Munis
<>at the Naimis4a1ran2ya about the creation of the Universe:
<>In the beginning in the heavy universal darkness, the [Page036-a+ 65]
<>first seed of life (an2d2a) appeared. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verse 28).
<HI>AN2D2AKAT2A1HA. The entire universe consisting of the

<>Atala.
<HI>ANDHA I. An offspring of Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Kadru1. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Verse 16).
<HI>ANDHA II. There is a story in M.B., about a hunts-
<>man, Vat2aka killing one Andha, an evil being. Andha
<>whose form and shape were that of an animal, by do-
<>ing tapas, became recipient of a boon for destroying
<>everything. Brahma1 rendered him blind lest the world
<>perish, and that animal began to be known as Andha.
<>When Andha began his programme of complete destruc-
<>tion many people rushed up to Vis4va1mitra in his abode
<>in the forest. Andha followed them. But, Vis4va1mitra,
<>in the interests of self-protection pointed out the refu-
<>gees to Andha. As punishment for this sin Vis4va1mitra
<>had once to go to hell. This story was related by
<>Kr2s2n2a to Arjuna during the great war at Kuruks2etra,
<>and the reason for telling the story was this: During
<>the fight Arjuna hesitated to aim arrows against Karn2a.
<>Enraged by this attitude of Arjuna Dharmaputra asked
<>him to hand over his famous bow, Ga1n2d2i1va to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>Feeling insulted at this demand Arjuna, all on a sud-
<>den, drew his sword to do away with Dharmaputra.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, prevented Arjuna from attacking his noble
<>brother, and in this context related the above story to
<>prove the truth that sins committed even unwittingly
<>will lead one, as in the case of Vis4va1mitra to hell.
<>(M.B., Karn2a Parva, Chapter 69).
<HI>ANDHA III. Upamanyu, the excellent disciple of
<>Dhaumya, consumed the leaves of a tree which made
<>him blind. (See Ayodhadhaumya) (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 3).
<HI>ANDHAKA I. There was a very renowned king called
<>Andhaka in the Yadu dynasty. All kings belonging to
<>this dynasty used to be called Andhakas.
<HI>ANDHAKA II. Verse 12, Chapter 4 of M.B., Udyoga
<>Parva refers to another King called Andhaka. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas had sent to him a messenger soliciting mili-
<>tary help.
<HI>ANDHAKA III. An Asura.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} This Asura was the foster son of Hiran2ya1ks2a.
<>S4iva was really his father. While once S4iva was
<>immersed in yoga his daughter closed his eyes play-
<>fully with her hands, and lo! a darkness rose and
<>enveloped the whole place. From that darkness, with
<>a sound as that of thunderbolt, appeared a Ra1ks2asa.
<>He got the name Andhaka as he was born from dark-
<>ness. At that time Hiran2ya1ks2a was doing tapas for a
<>son. S4iva appeared before him and bestowing on him
<>Andhaka as a foster son said as follows: “If he
<>(Andhaka) earns the hatred of the world or desires
<>even the mother of the three worlds or kills brahmins
<>I will myself burn him to ashes”. After saying this
<>S4iva disappeared. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 63).
<NI>2) {%Andhaka desires Pa1rvati1 with lust.%} One day overcome
<>by erotic passion Andhaka said to his henchmen as
<>follows: “He is my true friend who brings S4iva's
<>consort, Pa1rvati1 to me. Yes, he is my brother, nay,
<>father even.” Hearing these ravings of Andhaka,
<>Prahla1da went to him and convinced him that Pa1rvati1, [Page036-b+ 65]
<>in fact was his mother. But Andhaka was not quieten-
<>ed. Then Prahla1da explained to him the gravity of
<>the sin of desiring other people's wives. Even this had
<>no effect on Andhaka. He sent S4ambara1sura to S4iva
<>to ask for and bring Pa1rvati1 to him. S4iva sent word to
<>Andhaka that if the latter would defeat him in the
<>game of dice Pa1rvati1 would be sent to him. Andhaka
<>got enraged and rushed to mount Mandara and began
<>a fight with S4iva.
<NI>3) {%Death.%} Defeated in the encounter, Andhaka craved
<>for S4iva's pardon. He admitted that Pa1rvati1 was his
<>mother. He also prayed for S4iva's blessings for removal
<>of his Asurahood. S4iva granted him the prayers. The
<>sins and Asurahood of Andhaka were thus ended. S4iva
<>made him the head of the Asuras, named Bhr2n3gi.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 63 etc.).
<HI>ANDHAKA(M). A sacred pool. A dip in this pool will

<HI>ANDHAKU1PA(M). In the Devi1 Bha1gavata Maha1vis2n2u
<>describes 28 hells to Na1rada, and Andhaku1pam is one
<>of them. (see Naraka). Andhaku1pa is reserved for those
<>who kill either Brahmins or devotees of God or Sannya1-
<>sins (holy people). This hell abounds in cruel beasts
<>like the bear and leopard, evil birds like the eagle,
<>reptiles like the snake and scorpion and dirty insects
<>like bugs and mosquitos. The sinner will have to put
<>up with all these sufferings in hell till the period of his
<>punishment expires. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama
<>Skandha).
<HI>ANDHATA1MISRA. One of the 28 hells. (See Naraka).
<>This hell is destined for wives who cheat their husbands
<>and consume food and for husbands who cheat their
<>wives and eat food. Agents of Yama get hold of
<>such sinners and push them into the Andhata1misra. As
<>the cords of the agents with which they bind the sin-
<>ners get tighter around their bodies they faint and fall
<>down owing to unbearable pain. When they regain
<>consciousness and try to run away and escape, the
<>Agents of Yama again bind them with the cord. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>ANDHRA (A1NDHRA). This is the Andhra Pradesh in
<>modern India. It has to be surmised that this place was
<>very famous during the period of the composition of the

<>49).
<HI>ANDHRA. Warriors from Andhra were called Andhras.
<>(M.B., Dron2a Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 8).
<HI>ANDHRAKA I. Verse 24, Chapter 4 of Sabha1 Parva,
<>describes this king of Andhra Des4a as having sat in the

<>the Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a performed by Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 11).
<HI>ANDHRAKA II. The warriors of Andhra Des4a were
<>called Andhrakas also. (M.B., Karn2a Parva, Chapter
<>20, Verses 10 and 11). In the Bha1rata war the King of
<>Pa1n2d2ya defeated those warriors. Kr2s2n2a incited Arjuna
<>to kill the Andhras and the Pulindas. (M.B., Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 73, Verses 19 to 21).
<HI>ANDHRAKA III. Andhrakas are classed with Mlec- [Page037-a+ 65]
<>chas (lowest caste of people) in Verse 42, Chapter 207
<>of S4a1nti Parva.
<HI>ANENAS I. A king of the Lunar dynasty (Candra

<>Nahus2a, Ks2atravr2ddha, Ra1ji, Rambha and Anenas.
<>Nahus2a had a son named Yaya1ti to whom were born

<NI>Once there lived a hermit named Utatthya. He was
<>the elder brother of Br2haspati. One day when Mamata1,
<>Utatthya's wife, was pregnant, Br2haspati approached
<>her with carnal desires. In spite of her efforts to dis-
<>suade her brother-in-law from his attempts she could not
<>prevail upon him. He forced her and satisfied his desire.
<>The child in her womb protested and kicked the sperm
<>of Br2haspati out into the floor. Br2haspati got angry and
<>cursed the child in the womb: “May you fall in perpe-
<>tual darkness”. So the child was born blind and
<>remained blind throughout his life. Hence he got the
<>name ‘Di1rghatamas’. Di1rghatamas married Pradves2i. A
<>son named Gautama was born to them. The duty of
<>supporting Di1rghatamas fell upon the wife and the son,
<>who put him on a raft and pushed him astray into the
<>River Ganges. King Bali, who was bathing in the river
<>saw this. He rescued the hermit and took him to the
<>palace and pleasing him by hospitality, requested him
<>to beget children in his wife Sutes2n2a1, who detesting the
<>idea sent a S4u1dra1 woman Dha1treyi1 in her stead and
<>eleven children were born to them. By and by Di1rgha-
<>tamas came to know of the deceit played by Sutes2n2a1 on
<>him and he became very angry. But the King pacified
<>him and pleased him again and Di1rghatamas begot five
<>sons by Sutes2n2a1. They were An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Paun2d2ra and Suhma. Di1rghatamas blessed them that they
<>would become very famous. An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Paun2d2ra and Suhma were the five kingdoms ruled by
<>An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga, Paun2d2ra and Suhma respectively.
<>These five are the famous Kings of the Ba1li family.
<>(Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 104).
<NI>3) {%How An3ga got children.%} Once An3ga performed a
<>horse sacrifice. But the gods did not appear to receive [Page037-b+ 64]
<>oblations. Holy seers said that the Gods refused to
<>accept the oblations offered by the King because he was
<>childless. So he performed the sacrifice called Putraka1-
<>mes2t2i (Sacrifice to get a son) and from the sacrificial
<>fire arose a divine person with a golden flask of pud-
<>ding, which he offered to the King and his queen. The
<>King and the queen Suni1tha1 ate the pudding, as a
<>result of which a son was born to them. He was named
<>Vena. This son was wicked. Because of his wickedness
<>the King became so miserable that he left his kingdom
<>and went on a pilgrimage. Since there was no other
<>means the people enthroned Vena, who tortured his

<NI>f) After the battle, S4ri1 Ra1ma anointed An3gada as the
<>heir-apparent to the Kingdom of Kis2kindha1. The neck-
<>lace which Ba1li had given on his death to Sugri1va, was
<>returned to An3gada. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>g) S4ri1 Ra1ma returned to Ayodhya1 after his forest
<>life and celebrated a horse sacrifice. The sacrificial
<>horse was caught and detained by King Suratha. Com-
<>ing to know of this S4atrughna sent An3gada to deal
<>with Suratha, who said that the horse was detained
<>with the intention of meeting with S4ri1 Ra1ma personally.
<>An3gada returned and told S4atrughna what Suratha had
<>said to him. (Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a).
<HI>AN3GADA II. There was a prince called An3gada among

<HI>AN3GAKARMA. Actions on the stage are of two kinds.
<>One is to express by the major organs of the body. The
<>other is to express by the minor organs of the body. Head
<>etc. are major organs and eyebrow etc. are minor

<>An3gakarma and those by minor organs are called Prat-
<>yan3ga Karma. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 341).
<HI>AN3GA1LAMMA. She is the wife of Vi1rabhadra, a servant [Page038-a+ 65]
<>of S4iva. She has a rope in her left hand, with which she
<>hauls up the spirits of the dead.
<HI>AN3GA(M). The kingdom ruled by King An3ga. Other
<>details:
<NI>1) {%The Dynasty.%} The first King of the An3ga dynasty
<>was An3ga the son of Bali. Anaga1bhu, Draviratha,
<>Dharmaratha, Romapa1da (Lomapa1da), Caturan3ga,
<>Pr2thula1ks2a, Br2hadratha, Br2hanmanas, Jayadratha,
<>Vijaya, Dr2d2havrata, Satyakarma1, Atiratha, Karn2a,
<>Vr2s2asena and others were kings of this dynasty. Karn2a
<>was the adopted son of Atiratha. During the period of
<>the Maha1bha1rata, Kings of the Atiratha family were
<>under the sway of the Candra vam3s4a (Lunar dynasty)
<>kings such as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u. (For further in-
<>formations see the word Atiratha).
<NI>2) {%How Karn2a became the king of An3ga.%} A contest in
<>archery and the wielding of other weapons was going
<>on in Hastina1pura, the competitors being the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. The status of Karn2a, who appeared
<>on the side of the Kauravas, was questioned by the
<>Pa1n2d2avas on the occasion and Duryodhana, who always
<>stood on his dignity, anointed Karn2a as the King of
<>An3ga, on the spot. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 136).
<NI>3) {%Drought in the kingdom of An3ga.%} Lomapa1da (Roma-
<>pa1da) the king of An3ga once deceived a hermit Brahmin.
<>So all the Brahmins quitted the country and thereafter
<>there was no rainfall in the country for several years.
<>The sages of the country began to think on the means
<>of bringing about rain. One day they approached the
<>King and told him that the only way to get rain was
<>to bring the great hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga to the country.
<NI>Once Kas4yapa happened to see Urvas4i1 and he had
<>seminal flow. The sperm fell in a river. A deer swal-
<>lowed it along with the water it drank. It gave birth to a
<>human child with horns on the head. This child was
<>called R2s2yas4r2n3ga. It was brought up by a hermit
<>called Vibha1n2d2aka in his hut. R2s2yas4r2n3ga had never
<>seen women and by virtue of this, there occurred rain-
<>fall wherever he went. The King Lomapa1da sent some
<>courtesans to the forest to attract R2s2yas4r2n3ga, who
<>following them arrived at the court of Lomapa1da the
<>King of An3ga and the King gave R2s2yas4r2n3ga, as a gift,
<>his daughter S4a1nta1. Thus the country got rain. This
<>Lomapa1da was a friend of Das4aratha. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Aran2ya Parva, Chapters 110 to 113).
<NI>4) {%How the Kingdom got the name An3ga.%} One opinion is
<>that the Kingdom got its name from the King An3ga
<>who ruled over it. Another opinion is that the king got
<>his name from the country he ruled. However there is
<>a story revealing how the country came to be called
<>An3ga.
<NI>In the realm of God, preliminary steps were being taken
<>for making S4ri1 Parames4vara wed Pa1rvati1. According to
<>the instructions of Devendra, Ka1madeva (the Lord of
<>Love--Cupid) was trying to break the meditation of S4iva
<>and when S4iva opened his third eye, fire emitted from
<>it and Anan3ga (Ka1madeva) was burned to ashes. It
<>was in the country of An3ga that the ashes of the ‘an3ga’
<>(Body) of Ka1madeva fell and from that day onwards
<>the country came to be called An3ga and Ka1madeva,
<>‘Anan3ga’ (without body). (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la-
<>ka1n2d2a, Sarga 26).
<NI>5) {%Other informations.%}

<>Vis4va1mitra told the boys in answer to their questions
<>thus: “In olden days this place was a countryside
<>known as An3gamalaja or Malada or Karu1s2a. There is
<>a reason for calling the country by that name. Indra
<>killed Vr2tra and thereby incurred the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1 and so he came away to this country and lived
<>here for a while. The Gods found him out here. They
<>poured water on the head of the unclean Indra and the
<>dirt, hunger, excreta and Karu1s2a having been separated
<>from his body fell on the soil of this place and was
<>mingled with it. Indra's body became pure. As excreta,
<>Karu1s2a etc. were mingled with the soil of this country,
<>it came to be called An3gamalaja, Malada or Karu1s2a
<>from that day onwards. One part of the country was
<>called Malada and the other part Karu1s2a. Indra, having
<>been purified by washing in water returned to heaven
<>with the gods. After that this country became uninha-

<>Parames2u. To Sabha1nara was born Ka1la1nala and Sr2n5-
<>jaya to Ka1la1nala, Puran5jaya to Sr2n5jaya and Janamejaya
<>to Puran5jaya. Maha1sa1la was the son of Janamejaya;
<>Maha1manas the son of Maha1sa1la, and Us4inara the son

<>Kr2mi, Suvrata and S4ibi by his wives Nr2ga1, Nara1, Kr2mi,
<>Das4a1 and Dr2s2advati1 respectively. To S4ibi were born
<>four sons called Pr2thudarbha, Vi1raka, Kaikaya and

<HI>AN3GA1RAKA I. An Asura who took the form of a pig.
<>The story of how this Asura was killed by his daughter
<>An3ga1ravati1, is given below.
<NI>Long ago there was an emperor named Mahendra-
<>varma1 in Ujjayini1. His son Maha1sena did penance for
<>a long time to get a wife and a sword. At last Devi1
<>appeared and granted the boon: “My son! take this
<>extraordinary sword. So long as you have this sword,
<>your enemies will not prevail against you. An3ga1ravati1,
<>the renowned beauty of the three worlds, who is the
<>daughter of the Asura An3ga1raka, will become your
<>wife in due course. As you do horrible deeds, you will
<>be called Can2d2amaha1sena”. He was given the sword
<>and a tusker called Nad2a1giri. One day Maha1sena went
<>to the forest for hunting. He saw a very large pig. The
<>King used his arrows. But they did little harm to the
<>pig. Moreover it turned the chariot of the King over
<>to one side and ran to a cave. The King followed it
<>with fury. On the way he sat on the bank of a lake
<>with wonder, for a lady of exquisite beauty was walk-
<>ing along the mossy turf in the midst of some maids.
<>Slowly she approached the King and talked with him.
<>The young lady had entirely captured the heart of the
<>King, who told her everything. She began to weep.
<>“Who are you? Why do you weep?” The King asked [Page039-b+ 65]
<>her. She replied with a deep sigh. “The pig you saw,
<>is my father An3ga1raka1sura. His body is as hard as
<>diamond and not vulnerable to any sort of weapon.
<>These maids have been caught by him from various
<>royal houses and brought here for my help. My name
<>is An3ga1ravati1. My father was changed to a giant by a
<>curse. Now he is asleep discarding the form of pig.
<>When he wakes up, filled with hunger and thirst, he
<>will do you harm. My tears flowed out in the form of
<>heated life-breaths, when I thought of these things.”
<NI>The King said, “Go and sit by him and cry when he
<>wakes up. He will ask the reason. Then tell him that
<>you had been crying, when you thought how forlorn
<>you would be without a mate, in case your father was
<>killed by somebody”. An3ga1ravati1 did as she was told.
<>Hearing her words An3ga1raka said, “My daughter! No
<>body can kill me. My body is made of diamond. There
<>is only one vulnerable point in my body which is on
<>my left forearm and it is always covered with my
<>bow.”
<NI>The king hid himself closely and heard everything. He
<>fought with the Asura and hitting at the vuinerable
<>point killed him. The king married An3ga1ravati1 and
<>took her to his palace. Two sons were born to him.
<>They were called Gopa1laka and Pa1laka. By the grace
<>of Indra a daughter also was born to him by her and
<>she was Va1savadatta1, the wife of the famous Udayana.

<>satellite of Brahma1 is seen to have been called by the
<>name An3ga1raka also. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 11, Stanza 29).
<HI>AN3GA1RAKA IV. We see one An3ga1raka among the one
<>hundred and eight sons of the Sun. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 10).
<HI>AN3GA1RAKA1. (SIM3HIKA1).
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended in the following order from
<>Vis2n2u. Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-An3ga1raka1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} In the battle between the Gods and the
<>Asuras, most of the Asuras were killed and one Asura
<>fled from the clutches of death to Pa1ta1la (the nether
<>world). Surasa1 was the daughter of that Asura. Kas4yapa
<>married Surasa1. To them were born the two daughters,
<>An3ga1raka1 (Sim3hika1) and Aja1mukhi1, and four sons,
<>called S4u1rapadma, Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura and
<>Gomukha. Thus Sim3hika1 is the sister of Ta1raka1sura.
<>(Skand2a Pura1n2a, Asura Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>{%Other details.%} This giantess An3ga1raka1 had a clash once,
<>with Hanu1ma1n. Sugri1va had sent a large number of
<>monkeys under the leadership of Hanuma1n to search
<>for Si1ta1. He gave Hanu1ma1n certain instructions regard-
<>ing the route he had to follow. Sugri1va said, “There is
<>a giantess in the middle of that Southern Sea. Her
<>name is An3ga1ra. She pulls the shadow towards her and
<>feeds on the object of the shadow.”
<NI>From this it is clear that she was a giantess who lived
<>in the sea between Lan3ka1 and South India. She knew
<>the art of bringing to her side, anybody who passed
<>over the sea, by pulling at his shadow. When Hanu1ma1n
<>jumped to Lan3ka1 from the mountain of Mahendra the
<>giantess attacked Hanu1ma1n. It is seen that the name [Page040-a+ 65]
<>Sim3hika1 also is used for An3ga1raka1. Hanu1ma1n who was
<>subjected to the excessive attraction of Sim3hika1, felt a
<>great storm raging round him. Finally he found her out,
<>a monster with such an uncouth face and a mouth as
<>wide as the hole of Pa1ta1la (the nether world). There
<>was a terrible fight between Hanu1ma1n and the monster,
<>in which Sim3hika1, fell on the ground beaten. After the
<>fight Hanu1ma1n resumed his journey. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-

<>celebrated by Yudhis2t2hira. (Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,

<HI>AN3GIRAS I.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He is a hermit born from the mind of Brahma1.
<>Six mind-born sons (Ma1nasa-Putras) were born to
<>Brahma1, known as Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya,
<>Pulaha, and Kratu. All the six of them became great
<>hermits. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65,

<F>*) There is another story about the birth of An3giras. At a sacrifice celebrated by Rudra, seminal flow occurred to Brahma1 who
<>happened to see some celestial maids and was overpowered by passionate feelings. Brahma1 put the sperm in the fire. From that fire appeared
<>An3giras along with Mari1ci, Bhr2gu and others. This deva (the shining one--the God) was called An3giras because his origin was from An3ga1ra
<>or Cinder.</F>
<NI>2) {%Important events.%}
<NI>(1) {%The failure of An3giras.%} There was a King named
<>Citraketu in the kingdom of S4u1rasena. Once An3giras
<>reached his palace when the King was in a miserable
<>state as he was childless. The King informed An3giras of
<>his sorrow. He pacified the King and said that a son
<>would be born to him. He and his wife Kr2tadyuti1 were
<>filled with joy. The other wives of the King did not like
<>this. They feared that when a son was born to Kr2ta-
<>dyuti1 the King might overlook them. To the king a
<>son was born of Kr2tadyuti1 and the other wives poisoned
<>the child and killed him. While the parents were weep-
<>ing over the dead child An3giras and Na1rada arrived
<>there and wiped their tears. An3giras agreed to bring the
<>child back to life. He instantly called the spirit of the
<>dead child to him and asked it to become the son of
<>Citraketu. The spirit replied that it had a large number
<>of parents in several previous births and that it was not
<>possible for it to become the son of Citraketu, and then
<>it vanished. An3giras and Na1rada went on their way.
<>Citraketu became a devotee of Vis2n2u and by the
<>curse of Pa1rvati1, was born again as Vr2tra1sura. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 6, Chapter 14).
<NI>(2) {%How An3giras cursed Sudars4ana and transmuted him to a
<>serpent.%} While Sudars4ana, a vidya1dhara (a class of semi-
<>gods) was travelling lustfully with a group of beautiful
<>girls he came across An3giras and some other hermits. He
<>teased An3giras calling him ‘durbha1ga’ (unlucky) and
<>An3giras cursed him and changed him to a big serpent
<>and he was promised liberation from the curse, when,
<>during the dva1para yuga (one of the four ages) Maha1-
<>vis2n2u would incarnate as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and would tread
<>upon him and then he would regain his former form.
<>From that day onwards Sudars4ana lived on the banks
<>of the river Ka1lindi1 in the form of a serpent. It was [Page040-b+ 61]
<>the time when S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was having his game of love
<>with the Gopa women. On one night one serpent bit
<>Nanda the foster father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. The cowherds
<>or gopas hit at the snake with burned wood. But it was
<>of no use. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came there and thrashed the
<>serpent, which instantly took the form of Sudars4ana
<>Vidya1dhara and praising S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a entered heaven.

<>stripped Pa1n5ca1li1 of her clothes in the Palace hall, in

<>in the game of dice. Before this Pa1n5ca1li1 had asked
<>Duryodhana one question, “Have you won yourself or
<>myself?” One husband was not authorised to stake his
<>wife Pa1n5ca1li1 who was the wife of five husbands. Moreover
<>according to the S4a1stras (sciences) the deeds executed
<>by a King, who was miserable due to hunting, drinking,
<>playing dice and hankering after a woman, were not
<>legally binding. Hence how could the Kauravas own
<>Pa1n5ca1li1?” Vidura said that the witnesses in the hall had
<>to give an impartial answer to this question, and that
<>the punishment of falsehood would come upon the doer
<>himself. As an instance he gave the following old story:
<>Virocana was the son of Prahla1da; Sudhanva1 the son
<>of An3giras and Virocana fell in love with the same
<>woman once. There arose a contention between these
<>two as to who was greater. They staked their lives on
<>the issue. Then both of them together approached Prah-
<>la1da and requested him to give a decision as to which
<>of them was the elder. Thinking that Prahla1da might side
<>with Virocana his son, Sudhanva1 said to him, “Sir, [Page041-a+ 65]
<>you should not utter words of falsehood, nor should you
<>abstain from speaking the truth. If you do so your head
<>will be cut into a hundred pieces by Indra with his
<>Vajra1yudha (the weapon of thunderbolt)”. Hesitating
<>to take a decision, because of the words of Sudhanva1,
<>Prahla1da went to Kas4yapa to clear his doubts, and
<>asked: “Lord, do you know which are the future worlds
<>destined for those who utter words of falsehood or abstain
<>from giving out the truth?” Kas4yapa said, “On him, who
<>abstains from speaking truth knowingly a thousand cords
<>of death will fall. He who tells falsehood will have
<>to perform many a deed of duty to attain heaven.”
<NI>Having heard the words of Kas4yapa, Prahla1da said to
<>Virocana, “Virocana, Sudhanva1 is greater than you.
<>An3giras is greater than me. Likewise the mother of
<>Sudhanva1 is nobler than your mother. So according to
<>your bet you owe your life to Sudhanva1.” Pleased at
<>the righteousness of Prahla1da, Sudhanva1 gave Virocana
<>a boon to live a hundred years more. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 63).
<NI>(6) {%How An3giras became the first son of Agni (Fire God).%}
<>Once An3giras was blazing out as a furious being. All
<>the worlds were illuminated by that flame-fire. As
<>An3giras was performing the functions of Agni (fire),
<>peoples of the worlds discarded Agni, who being sad at
<>the derision shown towards him by the worlds went to
<>a forest and hid himself there. The living beings
<>were in trouble owing to lack of fire. When he became
<>aware of this An3giras went to the forest and pacified
<>Agni. From that day onwards An3giras agreed to be-
<>come the first son of Agni, who resumed his duties as
<>usual. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 217).
<NI>(7) {%How An3giras got the name Atharva1n3giras.%} After the
<>slaughter of Vr2tra1sura, Indra went to the lake known
<>as Amr2tasaras and hid himself there in a lotus flower. At
<>this time the Gods anointed Nahus2a as Indra. Agastya
<>cursed him and turned him to a serpent and sent
<>him to the earth. When Indra returned to heaven many
<>persons gathered there to greet him. An3giras also was
<>one among them who did obeisance to Indra. He paid
<>his homage by reciting the hymns of Atharvaveda. Indra
<>who was greatly pleased at this, said to An3giras, “Here-
<>after you shall be known as Atharva1n3giras”. An3giras
<>who got this boon from Indra, returned with gratitude.

<>many other hermits came to Dron2a and told him,
<>“You have burned to death innumerable men with your
<>Brahma1stra (The most powerful of all missiles). Your
<>end is very near. So put your weapons down and stop
<>your fight.” Dron2a seems to have paid no heed at all
<>to the advice of the hermits. He did not stop fighting
<>too.
<NI>(9) {%The sermon of An3giras on the merits of Ti1rthas or holy
<>places (Baths).%} Dharmaputra once asked Bhi1s2ma about
<>the importance of holy gha1t2s or ti1rthas (Baths). Bhi1s2ma
<>told Dharmaputra, what An3giras had once told Gautama

<HI>AN2IMA1N2D2AVYA.
<NI>1) {%General. How he got the name An2ima1n2d2avya.%} Once
<>there was a famous Brahmin named Ma1n2d2avya. He did
<>Tapas (penance) for many years standing silent in
<>front of his A1s4rama, under a tree, raising his hands in
<>prayer. At that time some thieves happened to pass by
<>that place, with stolen property belonging to the King.
<>Finding that the King's men were pursuing them, the
<>thieves fled away after leaving their stolen property in
<>Ma1n2d2avya's A1s4rama. The King's men seized Ma1n2d2avya
<>with the king's property. Even prolonged and repeated
<>questionings did not bring out a single word from
<>Ma1n2d2avya. At last the thieves were caught. Mistaking
<>him as one of the thieves, the King's men produced
<>Ma1n2d2avya also along with the thieves before the King.
<>The thieves were all condemned to death. The royal
<>executioners took all of them to the place of execution
<>and stuck them up at the tip of a trident (S4u1la). The
<>thieves died, but even after a long time Ma1n2d2avya did [Page042-b+ 64]
<>not die. In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Verses 46-
<>51, it is said that at this stage S4iva appeared and blessed
<>him with longevity and then vanished. Several Munis in
<>the shape of birds came near Ma1n2d2avya who was lying
<>on the trident and made enquiries about him. The King
<>came to know of all these stories. Full of repentance, he
<>went and begged pardon of Ma1n2d2avya. The attempt
<>to pull out the trident from Ma1n2d2avya's body failed. At
<>last it was removed by cutting it off. Since the tip (An2i)
<>of the trident was left behind in his body he was there-
<>after known as “An2i Ma1n2d2avya”. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 107).
<NI>2) {%Curse on Dharma.%} After going about in the world
<>for many years with the tip of the trident in his body,
<>An2i Ma1n2d2avya once asked Dharma: “Oh! Lord, why
<>is it that an innocent man like me is afflicted with the
<>trident?”. Dharma answered: “In your boyhood
<>you once caught small birds and pierced them with
<>a grass reed. It is a result of that sin that you have been
<>pierced with the trident.” Ma1n2d2avya replied: “The
<>S4a1stras ordain that there shall be no punishment for
<>sins committed till the age of twelve. Therefore the
<>punishment inflicted on me is wrong. As the murder
<>of a Brahmin is a greater sin than any other murder,
<>may you be born as a man in the ‘S4u1dra Caste’.”
<NI>By the above curse of Ma1n2d2avya, Dharma was born a
<>son of a S4u1dra woman. It was this child who later on
<>became the renowned Vidura of the Maha1bha1rata.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 107).
<NI>3) {%The story of how the Sun did not rise.%} When An2i
<>Ma1n2d2avya lay on the tip of the trident another event
<>happened. Atri Muni's son Ugras4ravas was the husband
<>of S4i1lavati1. No other woman had so far surpassed
<>S4i1lavati1 in her fidelity to her husband. Once Ugras4ravas
<>happened to fall ill. He expressed his desire to visit a
<>prostitute's house. As he was too weak he could not walk.
<>The devoted wife S4i1lavati1 carried him on her own
<>shoulders and took him to the prostitute's house. They
<>were passing near the piace where An2i Ma1n2d2avya was
<>lying on the trident. Coming to know of the matter,
<>Ma1n2d2avya pronounced a curse that Ugras4ravas should
<>die before sunrise. S4i1lavati1 shuddered on hearing this.
<>Fearing that she would be widowed by the death of
<>Ugras4ravas, she, in her turn, pronounced a curse that
<>the Sun should not rise again.
<NI>Next day the sun did not rise. All activities came to a
<>standstill. At last the gods approached Atri Muni. They
<>induced Anasu1ya1, Atri's wife to persuade S4i1lavati1 to
<>withdraw her curse. Then the sun rose again and
<>Ugras4ravas died. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 42).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%} When the Pa1n2d2avas were living in
<>Hastina1pura, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once paid a visit to them. On
<>his way he met with certain munis. Among them was
<>An2i Ma1n2d2avya also. (M.B., Udyoga Parva, Chapter 83).
<NI>5) Once the King of Videha told Ma1n2d2avya that the
<>world is transient and advised him to strive for spiritual
<>peace. An2i Ma1n2d2avya who was pleased with the
<>King's advice attained moks2a (salvation) at once. (M.B.,

<>handsome prince refers to his being kidnapped by Us2a1
<>daughter of Ba1n2a1sura. Ba1n2a1sura, chief among the 100
<>sons of emperor Maha1bali had 1000 hands. S4iva pleased
<>by the sacrificial devotion of Ba1n2a1sura granted, as
<>requested by him, the boon that he himself (S4iva) and
<>Pa1rvati1 would guard the fort of the Asura, of course
<>with some reluctance. Now, none had the prowess to
<>attack this valiant Asura. Overflowing with conceit at
<>this he challenged S4iva to a fight. S4iva foretold that
<>the flagstaff of Ba1n2a would one day be broken and
<>then a powerful antagonist would defeat him. Ba1n2a
<>impatiently awaited the threatened day.
<NI>One day Us2a1 happened to witness the scene of S4iva
<>and Pa1rvati1 engaged in love-making. Excited by the
<>sight Us2a1 too desired to enact such a scene with a lover,
<>and she intimated her desire to Pa1rvati1. Pa1rvati1 told
<>her that Us2a1 would, within three days, see in a dream
<>a handsome prince with whom she might make love.
<>Accordingly, dressed herself in all glory with choicest
<>ornaments Us2a1 awaited the happy day. On the third
<>day a handsome prince appeared before her in her
<>dream. Waking up, she began crying. Seeing Us2a1 crying
<>Citralekha1, her companion, and daughter of her father's
<>minister, assured her (Us2a1) that whoever might be the
<>prince who appeared in her dream shall be brought
<>down with the power of Mantra. Citralekha1 drew the
<>pictures of all princes known to her and showed them to
<>Us2a1. The pictures represented all handsome men from
<>Devas to men. ‘No, this is not my prince charming’ was
<>Us2a1's reply. Then Citralekha1 drew the picture of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>of Pradyumna, and then of Aniruddha. When Us2a1 saw
<>Aniruddha's picture she stretched her hands to embrace
<>that. It was this prince who had appeared before her
<>in the dream.
<NI>Next night Citralekha1, by the power of her Mantra,
<>brought into Us2a1's room from Dva1raka1 Aniruddha, who
<>was then in his sleep. While Us2a1 and Aniruddha were
<>thus together in the room her father, Ba1n2a, got scent
<>of it and took Aniruddha into custody.
<NI>The disappearance of Aniruddha led to much commotion
<>in Dva1raka1. Then Na1rada reached Dva1raka1 and gave
<>details about the Aniruddha incident. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and
<>Pradyumna, in all rage, hurried to Ba1n2a's palace and
<>encircled his palace with a strong army. Then did Ba1n2a's
<>flagstaff break into two and fell down. The fierce fight
<>that ensued ended in the defeat of Ba1n2a. Aniruddha
<>married Us2a1 and the elated couple started for Dva1raka1.
<>Vajra was the son of Aniruddha. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama
<>Skandha, Chapters 61, 62 and 63).

<HI>ARAKKILLAM. (Palace of wax). Both the Kaurava
<>and the Pa1n2d2ava princes lived in Hastina1pura. The

<>of their eyes to the people. This evoked great jealousy
<>in Duryodhana who made up his mind to completely
<>ruin the Pa1n2d2avas somehow or other. Duryodhana, with
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's consent, built a new palace at Va1ran2a1-
<>vata. Though many others did not know that the
<>palace was made of wax the Pa1n2d2avas, from secret
<>information knew the fact. But, they only pretended
<>ignorance. Duryodhana and his minister Purocana,
<>saw to it that the Pa1n2d2avas shifted their residence to
<>the waxen palace. Duryodhana had planned to set fire
<>to the palace and burn to death the Pa1n2d2avas. But, the
<>shrewd Vidura through his messenger Kanaka gave
<>notice of the conspiracy to the Pa1n2d2avas just in time.
<>One night Purocana set fire to the waxen palace, but
<>the Pa1n2d2avas escaped by a secret passage, which the
<>architect of the palace had made while constructing
<>it, and about which the Pa1n2d2avas had previous know-
<>ledge. The same night a huntsman, with his five children,
<>was also staying in the palace. As they were uncon-
<>scious with heavy dosage of liquor they could not es-
<>cape the fire. Those six people, and accidentally
<>Purocana too were burnt to death. People, who gather-
<>ed at the spot, thus saw seven corpses, and the news
<>was broadcast that the Pa1n2d2avas, including their wife
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 and their mother had been burnt to death.

<>permanent abode of these divine birds. They do not
<>like the rainy season. So they come down to the earth
<>when rain begins at the Ma1nasasaras, and go back to
<>the Saras, when rain begins on the earth. This pheno-
<>menon explains Cerus4s4eri's (Malayalam poet) state-
<>ment in his Kr2s2n2aga1tha1 that ‘when rain set in ham3sas
<>-Arayannams--began flying away’.

<>va1ka got Devatva (divinity). (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,

<>ted the story of an Arayanna to elaborate the stand taken
<>by the aged Bhi1s2ma. An aged Ham3sa (Arayanna) which
<>once dwelt on the sea-coast preached to all the other
<>birds much about ethical actions. The birds felt great res-
<>peet for the Arayanna. They flew across the sea in search
<>of prey after entrusting their eggs to the Arayanna. The
<>old Arayanna grew fat on those eggs. There was one
<>intelligent bird among the lot, and when it looked for
<>the eggs they were not to be found. That bird informed
<>its colleagues about the treacherous conduct of the
<>Arayanna. The birds organised themselves and attacked
<>the Arayanna to death. Oh! Bhi1s2ma, the same will be
<>your end also. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 41, Verses
<>30-41).
<NI>4) {%Nala and Arayanna.%} While Nala, the prince of the
<>Nis2adha kingdom was resting in a garden he saw an
<>Arayanna in a tank there. Out of curious pleasure Nala
<>caught it, but seeing its mental tremor he let it free.
<>Out of gratitude for this generous act, the Arayanna
<>played the role of the messenger for Nala to get as his
<>wife Damayanti1, the very beautiful daughter of the
<>King of Vidarbha.
<NI>5) {%How the Arayanna (Ham3sa) got the white colour.%} Once
<>king Marutta was conducting the Ma1hes4vara Satra
<>(a ya1ga) and Devas like Indra came down to receive
<>their share of the Havis (oblations in the sacrificial
<>fire). And, this was the time when Ra1van2a with his
<>attendants was on his triumphal tour. Hearing that the
<>Devas were at the A1s4rama of Marutta, Ra1van2a also
<>went there, and Indra and the other Devas, trembling
<>with fear, assumed different disguises and hid them-
<>selves away. Indra assumed the guise of the peacock,
<>Yama of the crow, Kubera of the chameleon and
<>Varun2a of the Arayanna. Thus beguiled Ra1van2a went
<>his own way. The Devas, who thus escaped blessed the
<>family of those birds whose forms they assumed. Indra
<>shaped the blue feathers of the peacock with mixed
<>colours and eyes like his own. Moreover, he blessed
<>them that they would never be affected with any
<>disease, and that they would dance with their feathers
<>spread when rain set in. Yamadharma blessed the [Page047-b+ 65]
<>crows that they would get the offerings made on earth
<>by men to their departed ancestors. And Bhagava1n
<>Varun2a told the Ra1ja-Ham3sas: “I escaped the clutches
<>of Ra1van2a by assuming your shape and form. Therefore,
<>be thee, who are now black and white, in future as
<>purely white as milk”. Kubera blessed the Chameleon
<>with capacity to change colour as and how it pleased,
<>and also for its cheeks to appear golden in colour to the
<>onlookers. After thus blessing the birds the Devas dis-
<>appeared. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>Mahars2i with the help of the Marutta and wedded
<>Rathavi1ti. Mahars2i S4ya1va1s4va was their son.

<>with its horns and bellowing like hell. But S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>faced the beast, and rained blows on him and it was

<HI>ARIS2T2ANEMI I. One of the six sons of Vinata1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Vis2n2u, Brahma1, Kas4yapa and Aris2t2anemi.
<>Kas4yapa married Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1, daughter of Daks2a. S4uki1
<>was their daughter, S4uki1 had a daughter Nata1 and

<>of Vinata1. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 40).
<NI>2) {%Tapas4s4akti of Aris2t2anemi.%} Aris2t2anemi with his son
<>was once performing tapas in the forest. The son was
<>immersed in meditation clad in the skin of a deer thus
<>looking like a deer. Parapuran5jaya, the King of Hehaya
<>who happened at the time to be hunting in the forest
<>discharged his arrow against the son of Aris2t2anemi taking
<>him for a deer. When the king found out the real fact
<>he felt extremely sorry, and he craved pardon of the
<>boy's father for unwittingly killing his son. Then Aris2t2a-
<>nemi pointing out his son who was standing alive
<>asked the King, “Is this the boy whom you killed?”
<>The King was naturally wonder-struck. But Aris2t2a-
<>nemi told the King that there was nothing to wonder
<>at in the case as nobody would be able to kill them be-
<>cause their Tapas4s4akti was so great. The King felt so
<>happy at this, and returned to his palace after prostrat-
<>ing at the feet of the sage. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 184).
<NI>3) {%Some other details.%} (1) Sumati, wife of King Sagara
<>of the Solar dynasty, was the daughter of Aris2t2anemi.
<>(Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Canto 38, Verse 4). (2)

<HI>ARIS2T2ANEMI VI. A King. Realising the transient
<>nature of worldly life, he gave up his kingdom and
<>went to and did tapas at Mount Gandhama1dana. Indra
<>who was very much pleased at this sent a messenger
<>with a vima1na (aeroplane) to conduct the King to
<>Svarga (heaven). When he was told that there was in
<>Svarga also the states of being high or low, and fall
<>happened when the effect of good actions decreased,
<>the King gave up his desire for Svarga and sent back
<>Indra's messenger. Then Indra sent the King with a [Page048-b+ 65]
<>messenger to the A1s4rama of Va1lmi1ki so that he might
<>gain spiritual knowledge. Va1lmi1ki consoled the King
<>with the advice that the telling, hearing and pondering
<>over the story of the Ra1ma1yan2a alone would be enough
<>to get eternal salvation. (Yogava1sis2t2ham).
<HI>ARJUNA. The third of the Pa1n2d2avas.

<NI>2) {%Previous birth.%} Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a are often re-
<>ferred to as Narana1ra1yan2as (Nara and Na1ra1yan2a). In
<>their previous life they were two R2s2is called Nara and
<>Na1ra1yan2a, and from that time onwards they lived as
<>inseparable companions and sons of the same parents.
<>They entered Maha1sama1dhi at Badarya1s4rama in the
<>Hima1layas. Of the two Na1ra1yan2ars2i was a partial in-
<>carnation of Vis2n2u. About the Narars2i the Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata has the following to say: “Dharma had his
<>origin in the heart of Brahma1, and he earned great
<>reputation for truthfulness and adherence to Vedic
<>dharma. He married the daughters of Daks2a. Dharma
<>had four sons, Hari, Kr2s2n2a, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. Of
<>the four sons Hari and Kr2s2n2a became great yogi1s, and
<>Nara and Na1ra1yan2a, great tapasvins. Nara and Na1ra1-
<>yan2a did tapas, worshipping Brahma1 for 1000 years at
<>the holy Badarya1s4rama in the plains of the Hima1layas.
<>Nara was born in the next birth as Arjuna. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha). See Nara.
<NI>3) {%Birth.%} To Vicitravi1rya son of S4antanu was born
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra by Ambika1, and Pa1n2d2u by Amba1lika1.
<>Pa1n2d2u had two wives, Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. The curse of a
<>Muni made physical contacts with his wives impossible for
<>Pa1n2d2u. (See Pa1n2d2u). Kunti1, before her marriage had
<>attended on Mahars2i Durva1sas who pleased with her
<>service made a gift of five mantras to her. The effect
<>of the mantras was that Kunti1 would become mother of
<>a son from him about whom she was thinking while she
<>repeated the mantra. As soon as she got the mantras
<>she retired to a solitary place and thinking of the Sun-
<>God repeated the first mantra. At once Su1ryadeva appear-
<>ed and Karn2a was born to her by him. After assuring
<>her that the incident would not affect her chastity Su1rya
<>disappeared. Kunti1 abandoned the child to float in the
<>river Gan3ga1, and stayed with Pa1n2d2u keeping the other
<>four mantras to herself. Since Pa1n2d2u could not contact
<>the body of his wives, with his permission Kunti1 began
<>practising the other four mantras one by one. By three
<>mantras she got three sons, Dharmaputra from Ka1la,
<>Arjuna from Indra and Bhi1masena from the wind God
<>(Va1yu). The remaining one mantra Kunti1 gave to
<>Ma1dri1. She repeated it thinking of the As4vini1 Devas,
<>and two sons, Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 63 onwards).
<NI>4) {%Festival of birth.%} At the birth of Arjuna Kunti1 heard
<>a heavenly voice declare as follows: “Oh! Kunti1!
<>your son will be equal to S4iva in prowess and uncon-
<>querable just as Indra is. After defeating all the Kings
<>he will perform the As4vamedha thrice. He will please [Page049-a+ 65]
<>S4iva and get the great weapon called Pa1s4upata from
<>him. On the orders of Indra he will kill Niva1takavacas.
<>Hearing the above prophecy the Devas played ecstatic
<>music and flowers were showered from the sky. The
<>Saptars2is, Praja1patis and other sages arrayed themselves
<>in the sky. Thus, all animate and inanimate objects
<>celebrated the birth of Arjuna.
<NI>5) {%Naming.%} Sages from the top of the S4atas4r2n3ga
<>mountain came together to perform the christening
<>ceremony of Arjuna. While enumerating the various
<>names of Arjuna, it is said in the Vira1t2a Parva that
<>Kr2s2n2a was the name Pa1n2d2u gave to his son. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 123, Verse 20).
<NI>6) {%Childhood.%} The Pa1n2d2avas spent their childhood at
<>Hastina1pura with the Kauravas. Then Arjuna studied
<>the art and science of using weapons, dance, music etc.
<>along with the other boys. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>129, Verse 1). Kas4yapa, the high priest of Vasudeva
<>did for Arjuna the usual Sam3ska1ras like Upanayana
<>(wearing of the holy thread) etc. Arjuna was taught
<>the first lessons in Dhanurveda (Science of archery)
<>by Ra1jars2i S4uka. Afterwards, Kr2pa1ca1rya became the
<>preceptor of the Pa1n2d2avas in Dhanurveda, and it was
<>then that Dron2a1ca1rya came. There is a particular story
<>about Dron2a1ca1rya becoming the guru. (See Dron2a).
<NI>7) {%Special favour of Dron2a.%} Arjuna showed very great
<>interest in the science of the use of weapons. Dron2a, the
<>master, wanted to teach As4vattha1ma1, his son, certain
<>special things, and he began sending all his disciples to
<>fetch water. As4vattha1ma1 used to be the first to return
<>with the water, and before the others returned Dron2a
<>began teaching As4vattha1ma1 the special lessons. Arjuna
<>came to understand this programme and he began
<>returning with water along with As4vattha1ma1. Then
<>the guru began teaching the special things to both
<>As4vattha1ma1 and Arjuna. Dron2a instructed the cook
<>not to serve Arjuna food in the darkness. While
<>Arjuna was once taking his food, wind blew out the
<>burning lamp, and Arjuna alone continued eating.
<>Because of constant practice Arjuna was quite sure
<>about the position of the hand and the mouth in
<>the process of eating, and Arjuna surmised from this
<>that archery also could be practised in darkness. He
<>began practising them. The guru came to know of it,
<>and witnessing Arjuna's performance praised Arjuna as
<>a unique archer. (Bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 132).
<NI>8) {%Ekalavya's finger was cut.%} Ekalavya, son of Hiran2ya-
<>dhanus, King of the Nis2a1das (a tribe of hunters, forest-
<>men) approached Dron2a to learn the science of the
<>use of weapons. Dron2a, the Brahmin, refused the prayer
<>of this prince of the forest tribe. Ekalavya, after pros-
<>trating at the feet of Dron2a returned to the woods,
<>made an image of Dron2a with earth and meditating
<>upon it as guru began practising the use of weapons.
<NI>The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas went hunting in the
<>forest. Seeing there Ekalavya with his matted hair and
<>clad in deer skin the hunting dogs began barking at
<>him. Ekalavya shot into the mouth of the dog seven
<>arrows at one and the same moment. With the arrows
<>thrust in the mouth the dogs ran back to the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>and they found out the culprit, Ekalavya, who claimed
<>himself to be a disciple of Dron2a. Grief-stricken at this
<>claim Arjuna hurried up to Dron2a and said: “You had
<>pronounced me to be your foremost disciple without an
<>equal. But, today Ekalavya, another disciple of yours [Page049-b+ 64]
<>has relegated me to the second place”. Thereupon
<>Dron2a went and saw Ekalavya in the forest. Ekalavya,
<>in all devotion stood up and saluted the guru. And
<>the guru said as follows: “Oh! Ekalavya if thou
<>art my disciple give me the daks2in2a1 (fee) due to the
<>guru, and I desire to get the thumb of your right hand as
<>my fee”. At once Ekalavya cut his thumb and gave it to
<>Dron2a. Henceforth Arjuna became Dron2a's unequalled
<>disciple. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 132).
<NI>9) {%Arjuna got Brahmas4ira1stra.%} When once Dron2a and
<>his disciples were bathing in the river Gan3ga1, a whale
<>caught hold of the leg of the guru. The combined
<>efforts of the disciples failed to extricate the leg from
<>the grip of the whale. Ultimately Arjuna shot an arrow
<>and released the guru's leg. Greatly pleased at this
<>Dron2a imparted to Arjuna knowledge about Brahma-
<>s4ira1stra, and Arjuna was enjoined not to use the astra
<>against men, but to use it only when confronting
<>higher beings than men. [Bha1rata (Malayalam), A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 133].
<NI>10) {%Competition in arms.%} When the training of the princes
<>was almost over Dhr2tara1s2t2ra decided to have a rehear-
<>sal of their attainments, and the scene for it also was
<>set. The princes with bows and arrows appeared on
<>the scene. Yudhis2t2hira and others first exhibited their
<>skill in shooting arrows in the order of their seniority.
<>Every scene was explained to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra by Vidura
<>and to Ga1ndha1ri1 by San5jaya. Duryodhana and
<>Bhi1ma clashed with each other. As4vattha1ma1 pacified
<>them and kept them apart. And, then Arjuna and
<>Karn2a appeared on the scene, and the onlookers dec-
<>lared them to be equal in skill in archery. When
<>their shooting exhibition was over, Karn2a who got
<>angry again rushed to the stage. Arjuna also got
<>ready. Arjuna challenged Karn2a's eligibility on the
<>ground that he was low-born and not a Ks2atriya. At
<>once Duryodhana proclaimed him as the King of An3ga.
<>Though this pacified the scene, this competition in
<>archery served much to make the Kauravas and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas the bitterest of enemies. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapters, 136, 137).
<NI>11) {%Arjuna's gurudaks2in2a1 (Offering of fee to the preceptor).%}
<>At the starting of training the princes Dron2a told them:
<>“I have one thing in mind, and you must do it for
<>me when you have completed the course of training.
<>All the disciples except Arjuna kept silent at this, but
<>Arjuna promised to fulfil the guru's wish at the
<>proper time
<NI>The training was over, and it was time for gurudaks2in2a1.
<>Dron2a asked to be brought bound before him Drupada,
<>King of Pa1n5ca1la. (For Dron2a's enmity towards Dru-
<>pada see Drupada). Thereupon the Pa1n2d2avas marched
<>to Pa1n5ca1la, and in a fierce battle Arjuna defeated
<>Drupada. Though Bhi1ma tried to kill Drupada Arjuna
<>did not permit it, but took him bound to Dron2a.
<>This ended Dron2a's hatred towards Drupada, who
<>now gifted half his kingdom to Dron2a. Dron2a was
<>very much pleased with Arjuna for the above act,
<>and advised him to fight even him (Dron2a) if the
<>latter opposed him (Arjuna). To this Arjuna replied
<>‘Yes’. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 139, Verse 14). With
<>this promise to fight even the guru in case the guru
<>attacked him Arjuna became the most reputed archer
<>in Bha1rata. [Page050-a+ 65]
<NI>12) {%Jealousy of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.%} After the gurudaks2in2a1 Arjuna
<>marched against the neighoouring kingdom. He de-
<>feated very easily in war the King of Yavana and the
<>Kings Sauvi1ra, Vipula and Sumitra. These victories of
<>Arjuna made the Kauravas very anxious; Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>brooded over it. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 138, Verses
<>20-23).
<NI>13) {%Escape from the waxen palace.%} Duryodhana made
<>up his mind to destroy the Pa1n2d2avas somehow or
<>other. He got the Pa1n2d2avas to shift their residence to
<>a palace made of wax at Va1ran2a1vata, and one year after
<>this the palace was set fire to. The Pa1n2d2avas escaped
<>death by fire through a tunnel and entered the forest,
<>the next day. (See Arakkillam).
<NI>14) {%Arjuna on the banks of river Ga ga1.%} The Pa1n2d2avas walk-
<>ed much through the terrible forest, and after midnight
<>reached the banks of the Gan3ga1. At that time Am3ga1ra-
<>parn2a (Citraratha), the Gandharva was enjoying
<>his time in the river with some Apsara1 women. The
<>presence of men at the scene, the Gandharva did not
<>relish. Arjuna and the Gandharva crossed in words,
<>which led to a duel. In the duel the Gandharva was
<>defeated. As the wife of the Gandharva prayed with
<>tears in her eyes Arjuna spared him his life. The
<>grateful Gandharva told the Pa1n2d2avas many interesting
<>stories. He also made a present of divine horses and
<>imparted to them the esoteric knowledge called Ca1ks2us2i1-
<>vidya1. The Gandharva finally told the Pa1n2d2avas that
<>they were attacked because they came without Agni and
<>A1huti in their front. He also explained this fact that
<>Arjuna could subjugate him on account of his (Arjuna's)
<>genuine celibacy. (See Citraratha).
<NI>15) {%Pa1n5ca1lisvayam3vara.%} Citraratha, during his talks
<>with the a1n2d2avas had pointed out to them the need to
<>have a priest to lead and guide them in all matters,
<>and accordingly they visited Dhaumya1s4rama and ins-
<>talled the Mahars2i (Dhaumya) as their priest.
<NI>And, meantime seeing thousands of people on their way
<>to attend the Svayam3vara (marriage by open choice
<>of husband by the girl) of Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1) daughter
<>of the King of a1n5ca1la, the Pa1n2d2avas also followed the
<>crowd. Veda Vya1sa, whom the Pa1n2d2avas met on their
<>way blessed them. King Drupada wished to give his
<>daughter Kr2s2n2a1 in marriage to Arjuna. The news that
<>the n2d2a as were burned to death in the palace of
<>wax grieved Drupada. Yet he had made arrangements for
<>a trial of strength by Heroes at the Svayam3vara. A
<>tremendous bow was got ready and installed on the
<>ground, and a machine constructed which was kept
<>suspended in the air. The target was placed inside
<>the machine. And then Drupada spoke thus: “My
<>daughter shall be married to him who will bend the
<>bow and with the first arrow hit the target placed
<>inside the machine”. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 155,
<>Verse 11). Great warriors like Duryodhana, Karn2a,
<>S4is4upa1la, S4im3s4uma1ra took their seats in the marriage
<>hall. All the kings failed even to lift the bow up. Ulti-
<>mately Arjuna lifted the bow and hit the target very
<>easily. Pa1n5ca1li1 put the wedding garland on Arjuna's
<>neck. When the Pa1n2d2avas returned to their mother
<>with Pa1n5ca1li1 in the evening the mother from inside her
<>room said: “What you have got today, my sons, you
<>enjoy among yourselves.” Kunti1 said this under the
<>impression that what her sons had got was some
<>Bhiks2a1. At any rate, in obedience to the above injunc- [Page050-b+ 65]

<>during a particular year if any other husband than the
<>one whose turn it was to live with Pa1n5ca1li1 saw her the

<NI>Once a brahmin came to the palace complaining that

<NI>17B) {%The mark on Arjuna's flag is Hanu1ma1n, and the
<>following story is attached to it.%} Arjuna, once during a
<>tour of the country was much surprised to see the Dam
<>constructed by S4ri1 Ra1ma from Ra1mes4vara to Lan3ka1.
<>He also felt that it was not at all proper on the part
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma to have sought the help of monkeys to
<>construct the dam. S4ri1 Ra1ma could have made a dam
<>with arrows. Arjuna put this question to a great
<>scholar (Pandit) who was sitting nearby reading the
<>Ra1ma1yan2a. Neither the Pandit nor the other brahmins
<>gathered there could give a convincing answer to Ar-
<>juna's doubts. Then a monkey child went up to Arjuna
<>and told him with pride that a dam made of arrows
<>would have broken when the monkeys walked on it.
<>Arjuna said then, “no, no, no monkey will be able to
<>break the dam built with Ra1ma's arrows; which monkey
<>will break a dam of arrows made even by me?” And,
<>a debate began about the subject. The monkey and
<>Arjuna agreed to a bet that if a monkey broke the dam
<>made by Arjuna he would end his life by jumping into
<>fire, and if the monkey could not break the dam it
<>would for ever be Arjuna's slave. Arjuna constructed
<>a dam with arrows. And, as soon as the monkey set
<>foot on it it was broken. Arjuna tried again. Though
<>now it caused some efforts on the part of the monkey
<>the dam broke this time also. Arjuna was thus left with
<>no alternative but to die by jumping into fire and a
<>fire was accordingly lit. Before Arjuna jumped into the
<>fire a brahmin boy, who was bathing in the river ran [Page051-a+ 65]
<>upto Arjuna and told him that his attempt at self
<>annihilation was not justified as the bet was made with-
<>out an arbiter. When Arjuna who was wedded so
<>much to truth brushed aside this argument and got
<>ready to end his life the boy said: “If you are so very
<>insistent about it you (Arjuna and the monkey) com-
<>pete once again with me as arbiter. This suggestion of
<>the boy was accepted. The monkey child tried its best
<>to break the dam, but it failed. It developed its body
<>to the size of a mountain and jumped on the dam.
<>Even then it did not break. Then he ran up to the boy
<>who was acting as arbiter and prostrated at his feet
<>crying ‘Ra1macandra’. At the same moment Arjuna
<>also prostrated before the boy crying ‘S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, slave
<>to devotees’. The boy asked both of them to get up,
<>and after admonishing them for their conceit gave them
<>good advice. He also asked the monkey child to keep
<>his word by remaining as the emblem of Arjuna's flag.
<NI>(The monkey boy was actually Hanu1ma1n and the
<>brahmin boy S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>17C) {%Arjuna married Subhadra1.%} Arjuna went to the holy
<>place called Saubhadrati1rtha and redeemed the woman
<>named Varga1 from the curse she was labouring under.
<>(See Varga1). Arjuna continued his journey and reached
<>Gokarn2a and Prabha1sa ti1rtha, where he met Gada,
<>brother of S4ri1 kr2s2n2a. Gada described to Arjuna the
<>great beauty of his sister, Subhadra1. Arjuna went to
<>Dva1raka1 and paid his respects to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. A few days
<>later the ya1davas celebrated a great festival at mount
<>Raivataka. Arjuna went there disguised as a Sannya1sin
<>and forcibly took away Subhadra1 with him with the
<>permission of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Though the ya1davas got ready
<>for a fight they were ultimately pacified, and Subhadra1
<>was married to Arjuna. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter,
<>218-224).
<NI>17D) {%Brahmin boy saved.%} When once Arjuna was in
<>Dva1raka1 with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a a brahmin appeared on the
<>scene lamenting that his child died as soon as it was
<>born. Nobody paid any heed to this, and then Arjuna
<>rose up and assured protection to the next child to be
<>born to the brahmin and asked him to return home in
<>peace. Arjuna also vowed that he would end his life
<>by jumping into fire if he failed to protect the next
<>child of the brahmin.
<NI>As the time for the delivery of his wife approached the
<>brahmin took Arjuna home. Arjuna made the house
<>secure by making an enclosure with his arrows. Yet
<>the child died; not only that, at the time of birth it-
<>self its body disappeared. And, the brahmin heaped
<>insults on Arjuna, who looked very foolish. Rendered
<>thus an object of ridicule Arjuna began to make a fire
<>for him to jump into. At this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a appeared be-
<>fore Arjuna and prevented him from jumping into fire.
<>And then both Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna went to Vis2n2uloka
<>and submitted the case of the brahmin to him. Vis2n2u
<>told them: “Oh! Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna, it was I who took
<>away the brahmin boys for the pleasure of seeing you
<>both here. You may immediately return with the brah-
<>min boys. And, Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna returned with the
<>boys to the brahmin, who now felt very happy.

<>were spending their days on the banks of river Yamuna1

<>Agni Bhagava1n, who presented to Arjuna the bow
<>called Ga1n2d2i1va, a white horse and many other power-

<>sent a heavy shower of rain. By creating a tent with
<>arrows Arjuna saved the forest from the rain. Arjuna
<>killed Taks2aka's wife, cursed the N ga called As4vasena
<>and saved Maya, the architect of the Asuras who was

<>divine arrows to Arjuna. Maya gave the famous conch,
<>Devadattam to Arjuna. By now the one year of the

<NI>18) {%Again to the forest.%} Maya, who escaped death in
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest, in his great gratitude, went to Indra-
<>prastha, and with the permission of Dharmaputra built
<>for the Pa1n2d2avas an exceptionally beautiful palace.
<>And then the Pa1n2d2avas made the conquest of all the
<>earth, and after killing enemy kings like Jara1sandha,
<>the Kimpurus2as, the Ha1dakas, S4is4upa1la, Kurundha and
<>Bhagadatta returned to Idraprastha and performed
<>the Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a. The Kauravas who got jealous at
<>this went on a visit to Indraprastha. When they enter-
<>ed the palace built by Maya they were put into many
<>a ludicrous situation. (See Sabha1praves4a). Insulted
<>and humiliated they returned to Hastina1pura and
<>challenged the Pa1n2d2avas to a game of dice, and in the
<>game the Pa1n2d2avas lost not only their kingdom and
<>other riches, but Pa1n5ca1li1 as well. Dus4s4a1sana dragged
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 and stripped her of her clothes in the royal
<>assembly and thus mercilessly insulted her. According
<>to the terms and condition agreed to with reference to
<>the game of dice, the Pa1n2d2avas had to lead forest life
<>for twelve years and live for one year incognito. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas again started for the forest. (M.B., Sabha1
<>Parva).
<NI>19) {%Pa1n2d2avas in Ka1myaka forest.%} A number of brahmins
<>also accompanied the Pa1n2d2avas to the forest. The noble
<>brahmin, S4aunaka consoled the aggrieved Dharma-
<>putra in the Dvaitavana. Dharmaputra felt worried
<>that he could not feed the brahmins who accompanied
<>him into the forest. Pa1n5ca1li1 prayed to the Sun-God,
<>and he gave the Aks2ayapa1tra to her. (See Aks2yapa1tra).
<>And, after this the Pa1n2d2avas, along with the brahmins,
<>entered the Ka1myaka forest. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 36).
<NI>20) {%Arjuna secured divine arrows.%} Dharmaputra asked
<>Arjuna to do tapas in the Hima1layas and thus secure
<>divine arrows. Accordingly Arjuna went south and saw
<>Indra in the Indraki1la mountain. Indra gave him
<>boons. There Arjuna killed Mu1ka1sura. And, then
<>Arjuna went to Mount Kaila1sa and prayerfully concen-
<>trated his mind on S4iva. S4iva appeared in the guise of
<>a forest dweller. (See Pa1s4upata1stra). After that he got
<>the Dan2d2a1stra from Yama, Pa1s4a1stra from Varun2a and
<>Antardha1na1stra from Kubera. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapters 37-41).
<NI>21) {%Arjuna in Indraloka.%} Indra, who was so very pleas-
<>ed that Arjuna got so many divine arrows deputed his
<>charioteer, Ma1tali, to bring Arjuna to Devaloka, and
<>at Devaloka he learned more about archery and music.
<>The Apsara1 women forgot themselves when they saw
<>the exceptionally handsome Arjuna. Urvas4i1, mad with [Page052-a+ 65]
<>love, sent her messenger Citrasena to Indra. Being told
<>about Urvas4i1's love Arjuna closed both his ears with
<>hands, and reminded the messenger of Urvas4i1's mater-
<>nal position with reference to him. Urvas4i1 cursed and
<>turned Arjuna into an eunuch. Indra consoled Arjuna
<>by assuring him that Urvas4i1's curse will turn out to be
<>of great benefit to him. Afterwards Arjuna stayed in
<>Devaloka for a few days with Citrasena, and during
<>the period he killed Niva1takavaca and Ka1lakeya.
<NI>Arjuna became a friend of Mahars2i Lomas4a, who had
<>gone to Devaloka to see Indra. Promising Arjuna that
<>he would protect Dharmaputra Lomas4a returned to the
<>earth. Arjuna left the Ka1myaka forest and returned to
<>his brothers after an absence for five years. He met the
<>brothers at Mount Gandhama1dana. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapters 42-47).
<NI>22) {%Procession.%} At last a witty and humorous brahmin
<>went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and dilated upon the hardships
<>being suffered by the Pa1n2d2avas, and Duryodhana and
<>others were extremely pleased and happy to hear it.
<>Yet, they shed crocodile tears. But, Duryodhana was
<>in a mighty hurry to see with his own eyes the pitiable
<>plight of the Pa1n2d2avas. On the pretext of going out for
<>hunting Duryodhana and others with the permission of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, started for the forest with a number of
<>attendants. 8,000 chariots, 30,000 elephants, thousands
<>of infantry soldiers, 9,000 horses, merchants, ornaments,
<>courtesans and thousands of hunters formed this pro-
<>cession into the forest. Just like roaring winds during
<>the rainy season the procession caused thunderous noise.
<>Duryodhana approached the pool in the Dvaita forest
<>and waited at a distance. (M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 239, Verses 25-29).
<NI>Duryodhana and attendants put up tents in the forest.
<>The Gandharvas obstructed Duryodhana, and he and
<>the Gandharva called Citrasena clashed with each
<>other. Duryodhana was made a prisoner. Arjuna came
<>on the scene and released him. And, thus humiliated
<>Duryodhana returned to Hastina1pura with the atten-
<>dants. (M.B., A1ran2ya Parva, Chapters 239-253).
<NI>23) {%Arjuna lost consciousness.%} While once Pa1n5ca1li1 was
<>alone King Jayadratha forcibly took her away. Within
<>seconds the Pa1n2d2avas confronted Jayadratha and regain-
<>ed Pa1n5ca1li1. Jayadratha and his men were killed. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas, who were very weary and tired walking in
<>the forest felt extremely thirsty. Nakula, at the instance
<>of Dharmaputra climbed a tree and looked around and
<>sighted a pool of clear water. When Nakula went to the
<>pool and began to draw water a voice from above was
<>heard saying as follows: “Do not be so very daring.
<>This is my ancestral wealth. If you answer my ques-
<>tions you may not only drink the water but also take
<>some with you”. Without paying any heed to this warn-
<>ing Nakula drank water from the pool, and lo! he fell
<>down unconscious immediately. Sahadeva who went to
<>the pool in search of Nakula and drank water from the
<>pool also met with the same fate as Nakula. Arjuna
<>and Bhi1ma also had the same fate at the pool. Lastly
<>Dharmaputra went to the pool and understanding what
<>happened to his brothers requested permission to drink
<>water. At once a Yaks2a appeared and brought the bro-
<>thers of Dharmaputra back to consciousness. In fact,
<>the Yaks2a was none other than Yamadharmadeva. (For
<>questions and answers of the Yaks2a see Dharmaputra.)
<>(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chapters 312-315). [Page052-b+ 65]
<NI>24) {%Life incognito.%} Now the twelve years of forest life
<>being over the Pa1n2d2avas decided to spend the one year
<>of life incognito in the Vira1t2a palace. Arjuna disguised
<>himself and deposited his clothes and weapons in the
<>hollow of a S4ami tree in the forest. And the Pa1n2d2avas
<>in various disguises reached the Vira1t2a palace. They
<>assumed false names: Dharmaputra as Kan3ka, Bhi1ma
<>as Vala1la, Arjuna as Br2hannala, Nakula as Granthika
<>and Sahadeva as Aris2t2anemi and Draupadi1 as Ma1lini1.
<NI>When the life incognito of the Pa1n2d2avas for one year
<>was about to expire a rumour reached the Kauravas
<>that the Pa1n2d2avas were at the Vira1t2a capital, and the
<>Kauravas thought that the Pa1n2d2avas will appear on the
<>scene if a war was fought against King Vira1t2a. The
<>Kauravas, with this object in view, lifted the cows of
<>Vira1t2a and that led to war. Uttara, the prince of Vira1t2a
<>boasted that he would fight provided he had a good
<>charioteer. Br2hannala (Arjuna) agreed to act as such
<>and they started for the warfield. At the sight of the
<>massive army of the Kauravas Uttara got frightened
<>and tried to run away from the field. But Br2hannala
<>tightly bound Uttara to the chariot, drove it very fast
<>to the forest, took back from the hollow of the S4ami
<>tree his weapons and returned to the battle-field. The
<>Kauravas were absolutely defeated in the war and they
<>took to their heels. They understood that the very clever
<>and terrible warrior in disguise was Arjuna himself. But,
<>by the time the period of the Pa1n2d2avas life incognito
<>was over. The king of Vira1t2a, greatly pleased over this
<>victory in war gave his daughter, Uttara1 in marriage to
<>Abhim3anyu, son of Arjuna. (M.B., Vira1t2a Parva).
<NI>25) {%Preparations for war.%} After the forest life and life
<>incognito the Pa1n2d2avas returned. The Kauravas refus-
<>ed to give them half the Kingdom. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, on behalf
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas, implored that half the kingdom or five
<>districts or five houses or at least one house be given to
<>them. But the Kauravas took the stand that not even
<>an iota of land would be given to the Pa1n2d2avas. And,
<>war was perforce decided upon. Duryodhana went to
<>Kr2s2n2a at Dva1raka1 to request for support in war. Kr2s2n2a,
<>who favoured the Pa1n2d2avas lay in false sleep as he did
<>not want to fight against them. Duryodhana sat at the
<>head of Kr2s2n2a. Arjuna, who came after some time sat
<>at the feet of Kr2s2n2a and remained there standing.
<>Awakening from sleep, it was Arjuna whom Kr2s2n2a saw
<>first. After the greetings were over with Arjuna, Kr2s2n2a
<>saw Duryodhana also. Between Kr2s2n2a without any arms
<>and the armed forces of Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna chose Kr2s2n2a
<>and Duryodhana his armed forces to help each side in
<>the impending war. (Udyoga Parva).
<NI>26) {%War.%} Both the Parties were encamped in Kuruk-
<>s2etra ready for war. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a acted as Charioteer to
<>Arjuna. He stopped the chariot in between the opposing
<>armies. Arjuna felt deep anguish to find his own people
<>arrayed on the opposite side for war. Reluctant to kill
<>relations, elders, friends and preceptors Arjuna laid
<>down his arms in the chariot. Then did Kr2s2n2a instruct
<>him in Karmayoga (the philosophy of action). That
<>instruction and advice of Kr2s2n2a is the world-famous
<>Bhagavad Gi1ta1. The Gi1ta1 cleared off Arjuna's illusions
<>and he praised the Lord, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, who revealed his
<>all comprehensive form (Vis4varu1pa) to Arjuna.
<NI>On the first day of the war Arjuna fought a duel with
<>Bhi1s2ma, and the second day he fought the Kaurava
<>forces with exceptional prowess. And then Arjuna pre- [Page053-a+ 64]
<>vented Kr2s2n2a from killing Bhi1s2ma. But, the Kaurava
<>army faced defeat that day. On the third day Arjuna
<>defeated Bhi1s2ma, As4vattha1ma1, Trigartta, Bhagadatta
<>and others. Thereupon a really fierce fight began. The
<>war lasted for 18 days. The important incidents during
<>the 18 days can be summarised as follows:--
<>(1) Fierce fight between Arjuna and Bhi1s2ma.
<>(2) Fight between Arjuna and As4vattha1ma1.

<>after digvijaya Arjuna was killed by the arrows of his
<>son, Babhruva1hana. Immediately did Ulu1pi1, Arjuna's
<>wife bring back to life her husband by Mr2tasan5ji1vani1

<>prastha1na Parva, Chapter 1, Verses 1-42). The Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas continued their journey, Yudhis2t2hira leading them.
<>They reached the Hima1layas, and there Pa1n5ca1li1 expir-
<>ed. To Bhi1ma's querry as to why Pa1n5ca1li1 expired first,
<>Yudhis2t2hira replied that it was due to her having been
<>more partial to Arjuna. The others continued their
<>journey and then Sahadeva died. Yudhis2t2hira explain-
<>ed that Sahadeva died second due to his arrogance
<>and conceit. And, the others continued going forward.
<>An emaciated dog was already with the Pa1n2d2avas
<>during their journey. Nakula was the third to die, and
<>Yudhis2t2hira attributed it to his (Nakula) extreme con-
<>ceit about his beauty. And, Arjuna's death next,
<>Yudhis2t2hira said, was due to his having not kept his
<>vow, once made, to kill the whole lot of enemies in a
<>day. After proceeding a short distance further Bhi1ma
<>also fell dead, and Yudhis2t2hira thought to himself
<>that it was due to Bhi1ma's voracious eating. And, then
<>Devendra came in his chariot of gold and welcomed
<>Yudhis2t2hira to Svarga. But, he refused the offer saying
<>that he would not do go alone, leaving his brothers
<>behind. When Indra assured him that his brothers
<>were already there, in Svarga, Yudhis2t2hira got into
<>the chariot and reached Svarga, and he was elated to
<>find his brothers there happy with Pa1n5ca1li1. (Maha1-
<>prastha1na Parva and Svarga1rohan2a).

<NI>Once, the son of an old Brahmin woman Gautami1,
<>died on account of snake-bite. A hunter caught and
<>brought before Gautami1 the snake. His object was to
<>kill it immediately. But the serpent proved its innocence
<>by pleading that it bit the boy impelled and prompted
<>by Death. At once death (mr2tyu) appeared on the
<>scene and explained that it was prompted by the God
<>of Death. And, it was the child who was responsible for
<>the cause of death, and Gautami1 was the cause for the
<>birth of the child. Ultimately Gautami1 herself assumed
<>responsibility for the sin. Bhi1s2ma consoled Dharma-
<>putra by telling that as in the case of Gautami1 in

<>of Karma. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 1). [Page055-a+ 65]

<HI>ARUN2A I.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Son of Kas4yapa by Vinata1. Kas4yapa, son
<>of Brahma1, married Vinata1 and Kadru1, and being so
<>much pleased by their services he gave them boons.
<>Kadru1 got the boon to have 1000 na1ga (serpent) sons,
<>and Vinata1 to have two sons more powerful and vital
<>than the sons of Kadru1. After this Kas4yapa went into
<>the forest again for Tapas. After a period, Kadru1 gave
<>birth to 1000 eggs and Vinata1 to two. Both the mothers
<>kept their eggs in pots so that they were in the right
<>temperature. After 500 years the pot broke up and
<>Kadru1 had her 1000 sons. Vinata1 felt pained at this
<>and opened one of her pots. A child only half-developed
<>emerged from the egg and he was Arun2a. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 16, Verses 5-7). After another 500
<>years the other egg of Vinata1 hatched itself and a glow-
<>ing son emerged. He was Garud2a.
<NI>2) {%Genealogy.%} While Ra1ma and Laks2man2a wandered
<>in the forest searching for Si1ta1 they saw the wounded
<>and disabled Jat2a1yu. Jat2a1yu described his genealogy
<>as follows: “Kas4yapa, son of Brahma1, married the
<>daughters of Daks2a. Of the two wives, Vinata1 delivered
<>two sons, Garud2a and Arun2a. Sampa1ti was Arun2a's
<>elder son and he (Jat2a1yu) the younger. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 14). Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 19 also refers to Garud2a and Arun2a as the sons
<>of Vinata1.
<NI>3) {%Arun2a curses his mother.%} The fact of Vinata1 forcing
<>open one of her eggs prematurely and Arun2a emerging
<>out of it with only a half-developed body has been
<>mentioned above. Arun2a got angry at the haste of his
<>mother and cursed her to live as slave of Kadru1 for
<>500 years, and then Garud2a would redeem her from
<>slavery. He also asked her to wait for 500 years so that
<>the birth of another physically deficient son like him-
<>self might be avoided. After pronouncing this curse Arun2a [Page055-b+ 65]
<>rose to the sky. This curse was the reason for Vinata1's
<>becoming a slave of Kadru1. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>16, Verses 18-23).
<NI>4) {%Arun2a became charioteer of Sun.%} The Sun and the
<>Moon betrayed to the Devas Ra1hu, who waited at the
<>entrance of Devaloka to snatch off the Nectar (Amr2tam)
<>got at the churning of the sea of milk (Ks2i1ra1bdhi).
<>Thenceforth Ra1hu does often swallow the Sun and the
<>Moon. That phenomenon is called the eclipse (of the Sun
<>or Moon. Su1rya-grahan2a and Candra-grahan2a). Enraged
<>by these frequent attacks of Ra1hu, the Sun-God began
<>once to burn like anything. Murmuring that everyone
<>would cooperate when there was something to be achiev-
<>ed, but would go on their own way when the object was
<>achieved, the Sun-God began burning so virulently as
<>to destroy all living forms, and the Devas were frighten-
<>ed by this and took refuge in Brahma1. Brahma1 called
<>Arun2a and asked him to stand as charioteer in front
<>of the Sun-God everyday so that the Sun's intensity
<>might be reduced. From that day onwards Arun2a has
<>been functioning as the charioteer of the Sun. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 24, Verses 15-20).
<NI>5) {%Birth of sons.%} S4yeni1, wife of Arun2a delivered two
<>sons, Sampa1ti and Jat2a1yu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>68, Verse 71).
<NI>6) {%Arun2a assumed female form.%} S4i1la1vati1, the chaste
<>woman, once did naked Tapas to redeem her husband,
<>Ugratapas from the consequences of a curse. The object
<>of her tapas was to prevent the next dawn (Sunrise).
<>Owing to the intensity of her tapas the Sun ceased to
<>rise, and this gave his charioteer Arun2a some rest. Then
<>it was that Arun2a came to know of a programme of
<>naked dance by the women in Devaloka. Women alone
<>were admitted to the dance hall. Arun2a, therefore, assum-
<>ed female form and sat among the Deva women, and
<>the beautiful ‘female’ kindled erotic sentiments in Indra
<>and he enjoyed a night with ‘her’. Also, a son was born
<>to them. And, before the day dawned Arun2a, at the ins-
<>tance of Indra entrusted the child to Ahalya1devi1 and re-
<>turned to join duty as the Sun-God's charioteer. (Arun2a,
<>while he acted as Indra's wife was called A1run2i1devi1).
<>Arun2a was a bit late to report for duty, and when
<>questioned by Sun he detailed the happenings during
<>the last night. This evoked the desire in the Sun to see
<>Arun2a in female form. Arun2a did so, and the Sun en-
<>joyed her. This also resulted in the birth of a son, who
<>too was, at the instance of the Sun, entrusted to Ahalya1-
<>devi1. Ahalya1devi1 brought both the children with tender
<>love, which Gautama muni, her husband did not like.
<>He cursed them and turned them into monkeys. After
<>some time Indra went to Ahalya1 to see his child and he
<>was told the story of Gautama's curse. Indra searched
<>out both the monkeys. In view of the elder one having a
<>long tail he was called Ba1li (Va1li) and the neck of the
<>second one being very beautiful, he was named Sugri1va.
<>At that time, R2ks2ara1ja, the monkey King of Kis2kindha1
<>was very unhappy because he had no sons. He came to
<>know of Ba1li and Sugri1va, and requested Indra to give
<>both the monkeys to him as sons. Indra gladly obliged
<>him. Indra blessed Ba1li to the effect that half the
<>strength of anybody who attacked him would be added
<>to his own natural power. Indra then sent him and
<>Sugri1va to Kis2kindha1.

<>deputed a messenger to challenge Indra for war. At that
<>time a heavenly voice called out that as long as Arun2a
<>did not give up the Ga1yatri1 he could not be worsted in
<>war. Then the Devas sent Br2haspati to Arun2a to make
<>him give up Ga1yatri1. Arun2a questioned Br2haspati as to
<>why he of the enemy camp had come to him (Arun2a).
<>Br2haspati replied: “You and I are not different; both

<HI>ARVA1VASU. An ancient Ascetic who had been a lumi-
<>nary in the Durbar hall of King Yudhis2t2hira. There
<>is a story in the Maha1bha1rata showing the merits of
<>penance of Arva1vasu. This story was told by the her-
<>mit Lomas4a to the Pa1n2d2avas, when they arrived at the
<>holy bath Madhugilasaman3ga, during their exile in
<>the forest. “Long ago two ascetics Raibhya and Bhara-
<>dva1ja had built their hermitages and lived here. A son
<>named Yavakri1ta was born to Bharadva1ja. To Raibh-
<>ya, two sons called Arva1vasu and Para1vasu were born.
<>Raibhya and his sons were learned men. Bharadva1ja and
<>Yavakri1ta became ascetics. Yavakri1ta started doing
<>penance with a view to get the boon of learning com-
<>ing to him automatically without getting it directly
<>from Brahmins. When his penance became severe Indra
<>appeared and told him that the boon he asked for was
<>an impossibility and tried to dissuade him from his
<>attempt. Yavakri1ta was not willing to give up penance.
<>Later Indra came in the guise of a Brahmin to the [Page057-a+ 63]
<>Banks of the Ganges and began to build a dam with
<>sand particles. Yavakri1ta said that it was an impossible
<>task. Indra said that the desire of Yavakri1ta also was
<>as impossible as that. Still Yavakri1ta did not show any
<>intention of drawing back. Finally Indra granted him
<>the boon.
<NI>Yavakri1ta returned to the hermitage. Full of arrogance
<>he hankered after the daughter-in-law of Raibhya.
<>Raibhya plucked a tuft of hair from his head and put
<>it as oblation in fire and created a giant who killed
<>Yavakri1ta. Bharadva1ja felt sad and cursed Raibhya
<>that he would be killed by his son. Then with Yava-
<>kri1ta he jumped into the fire and died.
<NI>At that time Br2haddyumna, a Brahmin performed a
<>sacrifice. He invited Arva1vasu and Para1vasu as helpers.
<>As Para1vasu was going along the forest he saw his father
<>covered with the hide of a deer and shot at him think-
<>ing him to be a deer. He stealthily informed the matter
<>to Arva1vasu. Arva1vasu went to the forest completed the
<>funeral rites of his father and returned. Para1vasu spread
<>the rumour everywhere that Arva1vasu had murdered
<>his father. In the innocence of Arva1vasu, nobody
<>believed. Everyone avoided him. He became sad and
<>forlorn and went to the forest and did penance to the
<>Sun. The Sun appeared before him and blessed him.
<>He returned and brought Yavakri1ta, Bharadva1ja and
<>Raibhya to life again.
<NI>All these occurrences happened in this bath called
<>Madhubilasam3gama. (Maha1bha1rata, Aran2ya Parva,

<NI>Arva1vasu did penance to the Sun for getting children.
<>The Sun-God came down from his way in the sky and

<HI>ARYAMA1. One of the twelve A1dityas born to Kas4yapa
<>and Aditi. (A1dityas = sons of Aditi). The twelve

<HI>ASAMAN5JASA (ASAMAN5JA). A King of the Solar
<>dynasty born to Sagara. For genealogy see under
<>SAGARA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about his birth in the Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a. Once there was a king called Sagara in Ayodhya1.
<>He married two women named Kes4ini1 and Sumati. For [Page057-b+ 64]
<>a long time they had no sons and so they went to the
<>Hima1layas and started penance there in the mount of
<>Bhr2guprasravan2a. After a hundred years Bhr2gumaha-
<>rs2i appeared before them and pleased them thus: “Your
<>elder wife Kes4ini1 will give birth to a son who will
<>continue your dynasty and your second wife will give
<>birth to sixty thousand children”. After a few years
<>Kes4ini1 gave birth to Asaman5jas and Sumati to a big
<>ball of flesh. That ball broke and sixty thousand babes
<>came out from it. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 83).
<NI>2) {%Character of Asaman5jas.%} He was a very cruel man
<>always tormenting people. He used to throw little child-
<>ren into the Sarayu1 river and stand on the banks of the
<>river enjoying the sight of the children dying drowning.
<>People hated him. His father, therefore, drove him out
<>of his palace. To this bad man was born Am3s4uma1n, a
<>King who became the favourite of the people. (Va1l-
<>mi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 38).
<HI>ASAMPREKS2YAKA1RITVA. See under DEVASARMA

<HI>AS4ANI. A holy hermit. While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was going to
<>Hastina1pura this hermit met him on the way. (M.B.,

<HI>ASIKNI I. A river flowing through the Punjab in India.
<>This is called Candrabha1ga1 and also Ci1na1b (Ci1na1).
<>The R2gveda also mentions about this. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>ASIKNI II. A wife of Daks2a. Daks2apraja1pati, son of
<>Brahma1, commenced creation with his own mind. When
<>he found that it was not conducive to the propagation
<>of the species he pondered over the subject once more
<>and decided to effect it by the sexual union of the male
<>and the female. He, therefore, married Asikni daughter
<>of Vi1ran2apraja1pati. There is a version in the seventh
<>Skandha of Devi1 Bha1gavata that Vi1ran2i1 was born of
<>the left thumb of Brahma1.
<F>*) It was Maha1vis2n2u who gave Daks2a his wife, Asikni, when Daks2a was doing penance in Vindhya. (S2as2t2a Skandha, Bha1gavata).</F> Then the virile Daks2a-
<>praja1pati begot by Asikni five thousand Haryas4vas with
<>a view to propagating his species and the Haryas4vas
<>also evinced great desire to increase their number.
<>Knowing this devars2i Na1rada of enchanting words
<>approached them and said “Oh, Haryas4vas, I under-
<>stand you, energetic young men, are going to continue
<>creation. Phew! You are children who have not cared
<>to understand the ins and outs or ups and downs of this
<>earth and then how do you think you can create
<>people? You are all endowed with the power to move
<>about on all sides without any obstruction and you are
<>only fools if you do not attempt so find out the limits
<>of this earth”. Hearing this they started on a tour to
<>different sides of the earth to find out its boundaries.
<>Just like worms fallen into the ocean the Haryas4vas have
<>never returned so far.
<NI>When he found that the Haryas4vas were lost the mighty
<>Daks2a begot in the daughter of Vi1ran2i1 a thousand sons
<>called S4abala1s4vas. They were also desirous of propaga-
<>tion but were also persuaded by the words of Na1rada to
<>follow the footsteps of their elder brothers. They dis-
<>cussed it among themselves and said “The words of the
<>Mahars2i are right. We must also follow the course taken
<>by our brothers. It is wise to commence creation after [Page058-a+ 63]
<>knowing the size of the earth.” They also went to
<>different sides and never returned just like rivers falling
<>into the ocean. The loss of the S4abala1s4vas infuriated
<>Daks2a and he cursed Na1rada.
<NI>Again to commence creation Daks2a got of Asikni sixty
<>girls. Of these ten he gave to Dharmadeva, thirteen
<>to Kas4yapa, twentyseven to Soma and four to Aris2t2a-
<>nemi. Two were given to Bahuputra, two to An3giras
<>and two to the scholar Kr2s4a1s4va. Dharmadeva's wives
<>were Arundhati1, Vasu, Yami1, Lamba1, Bha1nu, Marut-
<>vati1, San3kalpa1, Muhu1rta1, Sa1dhya1 and Vis4va1. Of Vis4va1
<>were born Vis4vedevas. Sa1dhya delivered the Sa1dhyas,
<>Marut2va, the Marutvans and Vasu, Vasus. Bha1nus were
<>born of Bha1nu. From Muhu1rta came Muhu1rta1bhima1nis
<>and from Lamba1, Ghos2a and from Yami1, Na1gavi1thi1.

<>to this hell. (Chapter 6, Anus4a1sana Parva 2, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a). The Devi1 Bha1gavata describes Asipatravana
<>like this: “Those who forsake their own natural duty
<>and go in for that of others are thrown into this hell;
<>they die by the orderlies of Yama, the King of Death.
<>There they will be whipped by a whip made of thorny
<>herbs and as they run about with pain they will be
<>followed and whipped. Crashing against the big stones

<>with his permission went to Vasis2t2ha and got with child.
<>Vasis2t2ha returned to the forest. Even after the lapse of a

<>on a flat square piece of granite) and crushed her stomach
<>with it and she delivered a son. As he was born by using

<HI>AS4OKA III. A King of the family of the famous Asura
<>As4va. This king had been ruling over Kalin3ga. (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 67, Stanza 14).
<HI>AS4OKADATTA. Once the Vidya1dhara (a class of
<>semi gods) named As4okavega was going through the sky,
<>when the hermit maids of Ga1lava1s4rama (the hermitage
<>of Ga1lava) were bathing in the Ganges. He hankered
<>after them. So the hermits cursed him and changed
<>him to a man. The name of As4okavega in his human
<>birth was As4okadatta. The story of As4okadatta in
<>the “Katha1saritsa1gara” is as follows:
<NI>Long ago there lived a Brahmin named Govindasva1mi1,
<>near the river Ka1lindi1. He had two sons, As4okadatta
<>and Vijayadatta. They were good men like their father.
<>Once there occurred a great famine in the country.
<>Scarcity prevailed everywhere. Govindasva1mi1 told his
<>wife, “I cannot bear to see the difficulties of our peo-
<>ple. So let us give everything we have for famine relief
<>and then go to Ka1s4i1 and live there.” His good-natured
<>wife agreed to it and giving everything for the relief
<>work, Govindasva1mi1 with his wife and children started
<>for Ka1s4i1. On the way he met a hermit sage who had
<>renounced the world. He had his whole body besmear-
<>ed with ashes. With his tuft of hair and garment made
<>of the barks of trees, he seemed to be S4iva. Govinda-
<>sva1mi1 bowed before him, and asked about the future
<>of his children. The Yogi1 (hermit) said, “the future of
<>your two sons is good. But this Vijayadatta will go away
<>from you. Reunion will become possible by the good-
<>ness of As4okadatta.” Govindasva1mi1 felt glad and sad at
<>the same time. Leaving the hermit they proceeded to
<>Ka1s4i1. They neared Ka1s4i1. There was a temple on the
<>way. They stayed there and conducted worship in the
<>temple and took shelter for the night under a tree out-
<>side the temple. Other travellers also were there. Being
<>tired of walking all went to sleep. Vijayadatta the
<>second son of Govindasva1mi1 caught cold. So he woke
<>up in the night. When he began to shiver, because of
<>cold, he called his father and said, “Father, it appears [Page059-b+ 65]
<>that I have caught cold and I am shivering. I would
<>grow better if I could get some fire. So please get some
<>twigs and make a fire. I don't think, I may complete
<>this night otherwise”. They saw a fire close by. It was
<>in a burial-ground. Govindasva1mi1 took Vijayadatta to
<>that place where a dead body was burning.
<NI>Vijayadatta sat near the fire and warmed himself. In
<>the meanwhile he was talking to his father. He said,
<>“Father, what is that round thing seen in the middle
<>of the fire?” “That is the head of a dead body burn-
<>ing” said his father who was standing close by. He took
<>a burning faggot and hit at the head. The head broke
<>into pieces and some viscous stuff from the head fell
<>into his mouth. There occurred a sudden change in
<>Vijayadatta. He became a fearful giant with huge
<>tusks and hair standing erect on the head. Somehow
<>or other he got a sword also. That giant took the burn-
<>ing head from fire and drank up all the viscous liquid
<>in it. With his tongue which looked like blazing fire he
<>licked the bones. Then he threw away the skull. Then
<>he approached his father with open mouth to swallow
<>him. “You! giant, Don't kill your father, come here!”
<>a voice shouted to him from the burial-ground. Thus
<>Vijaya became a giant and disappeared. “Oh dear!
<>my child! my son! Vijayadatta!”, cried his father
<>and came away from the burial-place, and went to the
<>shelter of the tree and told his wife, son and others
<>everything that had happened. Stricken with grief
<>they all fell on the ground. All those who came to
<>worship in the temple gathered round them and tried
<>to console them. Among them was a merchant named
<>Samudradatta, a native of Ka1s4i1. He consoled Govinda-
<>sva1mi1 and his family and took them to his house in
<>Ka1s4i1. He showed hospitality and gave them a separate
<>place to live in. Noble men are kind to those who are
<>in distress. The great hermit had said that their son
<>would come back in due course. Hoping that such a
<>time would come soon Govindasva1mi1 and his family
<>dragged on their time. At the request of that wealthy
<>merchant they stayed there on. As4okadatta got his
<>education there. When he grew up to a youth, he got
<>physical training. He became such an expert in wrestl-
<>ing and other modes of fighting that nobody on earth
<>could overcome him. During a festival there was a
<>contest in wrestling. A renowned wrestler had come
<>from the south to take part in the contest. In the con-
<>test which took place in the presence of Prata1pamukut2a,
<>the King of Ka1s4i1, the wrestler challenged every wrest-
<>ler in the country and had overthrown each one of
<>them. Having heard from the merchant Samudradatta,
<>the King sent for As4okadatta and put him against the
<>wrestler from the south. A very serious fight began
<>between the two. They grappled each other with firm
<>and resolute grips. The audience was struck with won-
<>der at the variety of the modes of grappling and twist-
<>ing and turning they exhibited. Applause came from
<>everywhere. The fight lasted for a very long time.
<>Finally As4okadatta threw the other to the ground,
<>and got much presents from the King. Gradually he
<>became a favourite of the King, and consequently
<>became wealthy. One day the King went to a temple
<>of S4iva, a little away from the capital to observe fast
<>on the fourteenth night of the Moon and while return-
<>ing he passed by a burial-ground and heard a voice
<>saying, “Oh Lord! The judge had ordered me to be [Page060-a+ 64]
<>hanged, for a charge of murder, merely out of personal
<>grudge and without any proof, and this is the third day
<>since I was put on this scaffold. My life has not yet
<>departed from the body. My tongue is dried of thirst.
<>Have the kindness to give me a little water.”
<NI>“Punished without proof! It will appear only so to him
<>who is punished”. Thinking thus the King asked
<>As4okadatta to give the man some water. “Who will go
<>to a burial-ground in the night? I myself shall take
<>water to him”. Saying so As4okadatta took water and
<>went to the burial-ground and the King went to the
<>palace. The world was in darkness. With here and
<>there a spark of fire and light of fire-flies and lightning
<>mingled with the shouting of ghosts and the roaring of
<>the demons and occasional cries of birds and animals
<>the burial-ground was a dreadful place, where As4oka-
<>datta came and asked, “Who asked the King for
<>water?” He heard a voice saying “Myself” and he
<>went to the place of the voice and saw a man lying on
<>a scaffold. An extremely beautiful woman also was lying
<>under the scaffold crying, and getting ready to jump
<>into the burning fire since she could not bear the
<>separation of her husband on the new moon day. She
<>had plenty of golden ornaments on her body. As4oka-
<>datta asked her, “Madam! who are you, why are you
<>crying here?” She replied, “I, an unfortunate woman,
<>am the wife of the man on the scaffold. My intention
<>is to burn myself along with his body. I am waiting for
<>his life to depart. Because of my sin he is not dying.
<>This is the third day since he is lying like this. He will
<>be asking for water now and then. So I have brought
<>some water. But his face being high I cannot reach it
<>and I am seeing him burning with thirst, and am
<>swallowing the grief.” As4okadatta said, “See! The
<>King has sent this water for him. Now climb on my
<>back and you yourself give him this water.”
<NI>The woman instantly took the water and got on the
<>back of As4okadatta who had stooped down for her to
<>climb on his back. After a while he felt drops of blood
<>falling on his back and looking up he saw her cutting
<>flesh from the body of the man on the scaffold and eat-
<>ing it. He got wild with anger and catching hold of her
<>legs he was about to strike her on the ground, when
<>she shook her legs free and ran away and disappeared.
<>Because she dragged away her legs with force one
<>bangle came off from her leg and was left with
<>As4okadatta. Her behaviour aroused in him at first com-
<>passion, detestation in the middle stage and fear in the
<>final stage, and when she had disappeared from his
<>sight he looked at the bangle she had left behind with
<>astonishment. When he reached home it was dawn.
<>After his morning ablution he went to the palace. “Did
<>you give him water yesternight?” asked the King and
<>he replied “Yes”, and placed the bangle before the King.
<>“Where did you get this from?” the King asked and in
<>reply he said everything that had happened in the
<>night. The King thought that As4okadatta was an extra-
<>ordinary man and calling his queen showed her the
<>ornament and told her everything. She was filled with
<>joy and wonder. She praised As4okadatta a good deal.
<>The King said, “Dear queen! This As4okadatta is a
<>young man of greatness, learning, bravery, truth and of
<>good birth. He is handsome too. If he would become
<>the husband of our daughter what a good thing it will [Page060-b+ 65]
<>be? I have a desire to give him our daughter Madana-
<>lekha1”.
<NI>The queen also said that the thought was pleasing to
<>her. “This youth is the most suitable person to be her
<>husband. Some days ago Madanalekha1 had seen him in
<>Madhu garden and from that day a change is visible in
<>her. All laughing and playing is gone from her, and she
<>spends time in loneliness and thinking. I knew this from
<>her maids. Because of my thought about her I did not
<>sleep last night and only just closed my eyes in the
<>dawn. Then it seemed to me that a divine woman
<>appeared and said to me, “My daughter, Don't give
<>your daughter Madanalekha1 to anybody else. She had
<>been the wife of As4okadatta in previous birth”. I woke
<>up immediately. Believing in the dream I consoled our
<>daughter. I am glad that now you also think so. Let the
<>Jasmine creeper entwine round the Mango tree.”
<NI>When the King heard these things from his queen, with-
<>out wasting more time he gave his daughter Madana-
<>lekha1 in marriage to As4okadatta. They suited each
<>other so much that not only their relatives, but the
<>others also were delighted. Brahma1 is well experienced
<>in joining suitable things together. As they were all
<>getting on well one day the queen said to the King,
<>“My lord! this Bangle being single doesn't shine well.
<>We must have another bangle made in the same shape
<>and design.”
<NI>The King immediately had some goldsmiths brought be-
<>fore him. He showed them the bangle and asked them
<>to make one of the same pattern. They turned it on all
<>sides and looked at it and said, “Please your highness!
<>This is not man-made. It is not possible for us to make
<>one of this kind. Precious stones like these are not
<>available in this earth. So the only possible way is to
<>search for its mate in the place where this was found.
<>On hearing these words the King and the queen were
<>crestfallen. Seeing this As4okadatta said that he would
<>bring the mate of the bangle. Fearing danger the King
<>tried to dissuade him. But As4okadatta was not prepared
<>to change his decision. He took the bangle and went to
<>the burial-ground that night. To get the bangle he had
<>to meet the same woman who had left the bangle. He
<>began to think of a means to find her out. He procured
<>a corpse took it on his shoulder and walked about call-
<>ing out “Do you want flesh?” He heard a voice say
<>“Bring it here”, and he walked in that direction. He
<>saw a beautiful woman who appeared to be the mistress,
<>sitting in the midst of so many servant maids on a tree.
<>He called out “Take the flesh”. She asked “How much
<>will it cost?” As4okadatta said, “There is a bangle with
<>me. If you, will give me another bangle like this you shall
<>have the whole body”. Hearing the words of As4okadatta
<>the beautiful woman laughed and said, “That is my
<>bangle. I have its mate with me also. I am the same wo-
<>man you saw when you came to give water to the man
<>on the scaffold. Now the situation is changed. So you do
<>not recognize me. Tonight is the fourteenth lunar night
<>too. It was good that you thought of coming to night.
<>Otherwise you would not have seen me. Now see; let
<>the flesh be there. If you will consent to do what I say I
<>shall give you the other bangle also.” As4okadatta promis-
<>ed to do what she required. Then she began, “There is a
<>city in the Hima1layas known as Trighan2d2a. There lived a
<>giant in that city. His name was Lambajihva. I bearing
<>the name vidyucchikha1, am his wife. Only one daughter [Page061-a+ 65]
<>was born to me. Then my husband was killed in a fight
<>with his overlord Kapa1lasphot2a, who being kind did not
<>do us any harm; and I live in my house now. My daugh-
<>ter is now a young woman. I was roaming about thinking
<>of a way to find out a man of might and bravery as hus-
<>band for my daughter. Then I saw you going this way
<>with the King. The moment I saw you I knew you to be
<>the man I was searching for and I decided to give you
<>my daughter in marriage. What you heard as the words
<>of the man on the scaffold was a trick played by me. You
<>brought water to the scaffold and nobody needed water
<>then. With the knowledge I have in Sorcery and witch-
<>craft I put you into a little confusion. I gave you that
<>bangle to bring you again to me and it has served
<>the purpose today. Let us go to my house. It is my ear-
<>nest wish that you should be the husband of my daughter.
<>And I shall satisfy your immediate need also.”
<NI>The brave As4okadatta agreed to the request of the
<>giantess. She, with her power, took him to their city
<>through the sky. As4okadatta saw the golden city and
<>wondered if it was the sun taking rest after its tedious
<>journey. There he saw the daughter of the giantess and
<>thought her to be the incarnation of his adventurous
<>spirit. She was beautiful in every part of her body. She
<>was called Vidyutprabha1. He married her and lived with
<>them for a while. Then he said to his mother-in-law
<>“Mother! now give me the bangle. I must go to Ka1s4i1.
<>I have promised the King to get the mate of this bangle.”
<>Vidyucchikha1 gave her son-in-law her bangle and a
<>golden lotus flower which he accepted with great joy. As
<>before he came with the giantess to the burial-ground
<>through the sky. Then she said “I shall be here on every
<>fourteenth lunar night on the root of this tree in the
<>burial-ground. If you want to see me come on that day.”
<>“I shall do so”, so saying As4okadatta came away and
<>went to his parents. They were stricken with grief at the
<>departure and exile of their remaining son. They were
<>overcome by joy at the return of their son. Not waiting
<>long he went to the King, his father-in-law, who embrac-
<>ed him with joy. As4okadatta gave him the two bangles.
<>He presented the golden lotus flower also. The King and
<>the queen were amazed at the daring spirit of As4okadatta
<>who told them in detail everything that had happened to
<>him. The fame of As4okadatta grew higher and higher.
<>The King and the queen thought it a blessing that they
<>got so adventurous a son-in-law. Next day the King got
<>a casket made of silver and placed the golden lotus at the
<>mouth of the casket and placed it on the step of his own
<>temple for everyone to see. The white casket and the
<>red lotus were very charming to look at and they glistened
<>as the fame of the King and of As4okadatta. One day the
<>King looked at it with pleasure and said “If we could
<>get one more lotus like this, we could make another casket
<>and place it on the left side of this”. As soon as he heard it
<>As4okadatta said “If the King orders it shall be brought”.
<>But the King said “Ho’ you need not go anymore
<>on erranda like this. This is not such an urgent need”.
<>After a few days the fourteenth lunar night came. Leav-
<>ing his wife the princess sleeping in the bed he left the
<>palace and reached the burial-ground. He saw his mother-
<>in-law the giantess and went with her to the city of the
<>giant and lived there happily for a while with his wife
<>Vidyutprabha1. When he was about to return he requested
<>Vidyucchikha1 to give him one more golden lotus. She said
<>that there was no more lotus with her and that they grew [Page061-b+ 65]
<>in the lake of the giant King Kapa1lasphot2a. As4okadatta
<>requested her to show him that lake. At first Vidyuc-
<>chikha1 dissuaded him from this attempt. But he was
<>stubborn. So she took him to a place away from the
<>lake and showed it to him. The lake was full of golden
<>lotus flowers. It was a pleasing sight. As4okadatta imme-
<>diately got down into the lake and began to pluck the
<>flowers. The guards came and opposed him. He killed
<>a few of them. The others went to their master and in-
<>formed about the theft. Kapa1lasphot2a with his weapons
<>came shouting and roaring and saw his elder brother
<>As4okadatta. He was overpowered by joy and wonder.
<>Throwing away his weapons, with love and devotion
<>towards his elder brother he bowed before him. “My
<>brother! I am Vijayadatta your younger brother. By
<>the will of God I lived as a giant so long. You might
<>have heard this from father. Because we have met now
<>by good luck I remembered that I was a Brahmin. My
<>giantness is gone. On that day something obscured my
<>mind. That is why I became a giant”. When he heard
<>the words of his younger brother As4okadatta embraced
<>him. Both shed tears of joy. At that time Prajn5apti
<>Kaus4ika the teacher of the Vidya1dharas came to them
<>and said, “You are Vidya1dharas. All this happened due
<>to a curse. Now you and your people are liberated from
<>the curse. So learn the duties and functions of your
<>class and with your people take your proper place in
<>the society.” Having taught them everything they re-
<>quired he disappeared. Thus the Vidya1dhara brothers,
<>having plucked golden lotus reached the peak of the
<>Hima1layas through the sky. As4okadatta went to Vidyut-
<>prabha1 who also having been liberated from curse be-
<>came a Vidya1dhara girl. With that beautiful girl the
<>two brothers continued their journey and reached Ka1s4i1
<>where they bowed before their parents. That reunion
<>appeared to be a dream or something nearing madness
<>to their parents. They could not believe their eyes.
<>As4okadatta and Vijayadatta each saying his name bowed
<>before them. Their parents lifted them up and embraced
<>them and kissed them on the head, and cried for joy.
<>They did not know what to do or what to say. Their
<>minds were incapable of thinking. Everybody heard
<>this and was amazed at it. The King was also filled
<>with joy. He came there and took them to the palace.
<>As4okadatta gave all the lotus flowers to the King, who
<>was happy and joyful at the achievement of more than
<>he had hoped for. Everybody appreciated them.
<>Govindasva1mi1, in the presence of the King asked
<>Vijayadatta to tell his story from the moment he turned
<>a giant in the burial-place; “We are very curious to
<>hear it” he said. Vijayadatta began to say “Father,
<>you have seen how because of my mischief, I had brok-
<>en that skull and some viscous liquid fell into my
<>mouth and I changed to a giant. After that the other
<>giants gave me the name Kapa1lasphot2a. They invited
<>me into their midst. We lived together. After a few
<>days they took me to the presence of the King of the
<>giants. As soon as he saw me he was pleased with me
<>and appointed me as the commander-in-chief of the
<>army. He who was overconfident in his power went to
<>war with the Gandharvas and was killed in the fight.
<>From that day onwards all the giants came under my
<>control. Then I met with my brother who came to
<>pluck the golden lotus flowers from my lake. With this
<>all the previous conditions of my life had vanished. [Page062-a+ 63]
<>My brother will say the rest of the story. When Vijaya-
<>datta had finished saying As4okadatta continued the
<>story.
<NI>Long ago when we were Vidya1dharas both of us were
<>going through the sky and we saw the hermit maids
<>of the hermitage of Ga1lava, bathing in the Ganges. We
<>wished to get those girls. The hermits who saw this
<>with their divine eyes cursed that we would take birth
<>as men and in that birth we would be separated in a
<>wonderful way and both of us would unite again in a
<>place where man could not reach and we would
<>be liberated from the curse and learn everything from
<>the teacher, and would become the old Vidya1dharas
<>with our people. And according to this curse we took
<>birth as men and separation was effected. You all have
<>heard it. Today I went to the lake of the King of the
<>giants, with the help of my mother-in-law the giantess
<>for plucking the golden lotus flowers and recovered my
<>brother, this Vijayadatta. There we learned everything
<>from our teacher Prajn5apti Kaus4ika and became
<>Vidya1dharas and have arrived here as fast as we could.”
<>Thus he informed them everything that had occurred.
<>Afterwards by the learning he received from his teacher
<>he changed his parents and the daughter of the King
<>into Vidya1dharas and then bidding adieu to the King
<>As4okadatta, with his two wives, parents and brother
<>went to the emperor of the Vidya1dharas through the
<>sky. When they reached there As4okadatta and Vijaya-
<>datta changed their names into As4okavega and Vijaya-
<>vega. According to the orders of the emperor those
<>Vidya1dhara youths went to the mountain of Govinda-
<>ku1t2a with their people as it was their abode, and
<>lived with happiness and joy. King Prata1pamukut2a
<>with wonder took one of the golden lotus flowers and
<>placed it in the temple and with the rest he made
<>oblations to god and considered his family to have
<>made wonderful achievements. (Katha1saritsa1gara,

<>wife of Yaya1ti. (S4loka 18, Chapter 119, Udyoga Parva,
<>M.B.). See under Ga1lava.
<NI>1) {%How As2t2aka went to heaven.%} This story was told to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas by the sage Ma1rkan2d2eya.
<NI>“As2t2aka, son of Vis4va1mitra, performed an As4vamedha
<>Ya1ga. All the kings took part in this. Pratardana,
<>Vasumanas and Aus4i1nara S4ibi, and all the brothers of
<>As2t2aka attended the function. After the ya1ga As2t2aka
<>took his three brothers for an air travel and on the way
<>met the great sage Na1rada. Na1rada was also taken in
<>and as they continued their flight, As2t2aka asked Na1rada
<>who should step down from the aeroplane if only four
<>were allowed to go to heaven. “As2t2aka”, replied Na1rada
<>and explained the reason also. Once when Na1rada
<>stayed at the a1s4rama of As2t2aka the former found many
<>varieties of cows there and asked As2t2aka whose they
<>were. Then in self praise As2t2aka had said that all
<>those were cows which he had given away as gifts.
<>As2t2aka then asked who should get down if only three
<>were allowed to go to heaven. ‘Pratardana’, said
<>Na1rada and explained the reason. Once when
<>Pratardana was taking Na1rada in the former's chariot
<>four brahmins one behind the other approached him
<>and begged for a horse each. When Pratardana asked
<>for some time the brahmins were not prepared to wait
<>and so he gave all but one of his four horses and asked
<>the fourth to wait. As he was also found to be persistent
<>he gave the one drawing his chariot also and dragged the
<>chariot himself but abusing the brahmins all the way. It
<>was that abuse that gave him the slur. Then As2t2aka asked [Page063-b+ 65]
<>Na1rada who should get down if only two were permitted to
<>enter heaven. ‘Vasumanas’, said Na1rada and explained
<>the reason. Na1rada went to the house of Vasumanas
<>three times and each time the latter spoke highly of his
<>chariot. Na1rada also joined in praising his flower-cha-
<>riot and the brahmins present there also followed suit.
<>Pleased at this Vasumanas became proud of his possession
<>and his vainglorious talks made him unfit. Then As2t2aka
<>asked if only one were allowed to go to heaven who
<>should go. ‘S4ibi’, said Na1rada immediately. Even Na1rada
<>would be only next to S4ibi and Na1rada explained the
<>reason thus. Once a brahmin went to S4ibi for food. S4ibi
<>asked him what food he relished most and the brahmin
<>said that he would like to have the fresh flesh of S4ibi's
<>only son, Br2hadgarbha. Without even the slightest hesi-
<>tation S4ibi killed his son and cooked his flesh and when
<>the food was ready he went out to invite the brahmin.
<>But on going out the King saw the brahmin setting
<>fire to his palace, treasury, armoury, stables, harem and
<>elephant-sheds. Without even a quiver on his face, the
<>king respectfully took the brahmin inside and gave him
<>food. The brahmin was amazed at the patience of the
<>King and sitting before his food for some time told the
<>King that he would be satisfied if the King himself ate
<>that food. Respecting the request the King was about to
<>eat the flesh of his own son when the brahmin who was
<>none other than Brahma1 in disguise praised him for
<>his devotion and gave him back his son adorned with
<>sweet smelling flowers and disappeared blessing them.
<>When his ministers questioned him about this S4ibi said,
<>“I do not give for a name or fame. Neither do I give
<>for wealth and happiness. I do it because it is the only
<>way to be rid of sins”. (Chapter 168, Aran2ya Parva,
<>M.B.).

<HI>AS2T2A1VAKRA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The sage Udda1laka had a disciple named
<>Khagodara (Kahodara) and a daughter named Suja1t2a1.
<>Appreciating the devotion and good conduct of his
<>disciple, Udda1laka gave his daughter Suja1ta1 in marri-
<>age to him. Suja1ta1 became pregnant. When once
<>Khagodara was reciting from the Vedas the babe in the
<>womb of Suja1ta1 said, “I have learnt the mantra you
<>are chanting but the way you chant it is wrong”. (The
<>vibrations of sound created by the utterance of each
<>word is important). Khagodara was angry and he curs-
<>ed his babe in the womb thus “Since your mind seems
<>to be crooked let your body also be of that type, with [Page065-a+ 65]
<>curves all over”. When Suja1ta1 delivered the child it
<>had eight bends and light curves and so the boy was
<>named As2t2a1vakra, meaning one with eight bends.
<>(Chapter 132, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>2) {%Father died before he was born.%} When Suja1ta1 was preg-
<>nant they suffered much from poverty and at the in-
<>sistence of Suja1ta1, Khagodara went to the King Janaka,
<>to beg for some money. Janaka was performing a ya1ga
<>then and so Khagodara had to wait. When at last he
<>went to the royal assembly he was asked to enter into
<>a polemical contest with Va1ndi1na, the court scholar and
<>having been defeated by him was asked to drown him-
<>self.
<NI>Udda1laka got a son named S4vetaketu and Suja1ta1 deli-
<>vered As2t2a1vakra. Both the boys grew in the a1s4rama
<>on great intimacy and Suja1ta1 withheld the news of the
<>death of her husband from the boys. (Chapter 132,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%How Khagodara was got back.%} One day the two boys
<>went to bathe in the river and during a controversial
<>talk S4vetaketu said that As2t2a1vakra had no father. This
<>teased him much and As2t2a1vakra went to his mother
<>and gathered all the facts about his father. He went,
<>then, straight to the royal assembly of King Janaka.
<>He was not allowed inside. The gate keeper said that he
<>was only a boy and only learned men could go inside
<>the sacrificial hall. As2t2a1vakra contended that neither
<>size nor age was any indication of one's knowledge or
<>worth and got himself admitted into the hall. There
<>he entered into a polemical contest with the same court
<>scholar, Va1ndi1na, who had killed his father. Va1ndi1na
<>was defeated and was thrown into the same river in
<>which his father had drowned himself. The moment
<>Va1ndi1na fell into the river Khagodara rose up
<>from there and the father and son along with S4veta-
<>ketu returned to the a1s4rama. Khagodara then took his
<>son for a bath and when it was over As2t2a1vakra became
<>a bright boy without crooks. (Chapter 133, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.)
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} As2t2a1vakra wanted to marry Suprabha1, the
<>daughter of a sage named Vada1nya. When Vada1nya was
<>approached for this the Sage decided to test the love
<>which As2t2a1vakra had towards his daughter and said: “I
<>am going to test you. You go to the north to the Hima1-
<>layas. Pay homage to S4iva and Pa1rvati1 and go further
<>north. There you will find a very beautiful damsel. You
<>talk to her and return and when you come back I shall
<>give you my daughter.”
<NI>Accepting this challenge As2t2a1vakra went north. When
<>he went to the Hima1layas Kubera entertained him. He
<>remained there for a year enjoying the dances of celes-
<>tial maidens and then, after worshipping S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1 went further north. There he came across seven
<>very attractive women. At the command of As2t2a1vakra
<>the eldest of the lot, Uttara1, remained with him; all the
<>rest left the place immediately she started making love
<>with him and requested him to marry her. But As2t2a1-
<>vakra did not yield and told her about his promise to
<>Vada1nya. Pleased at this reply Uttara1 revealed that she
<>was the queen of the north in disguise and was testing
<>him. She then blessed As2t2a1vakra who fulfilling his
<>mission successfully, returned and married the girl he
<>wanted. (Chapter 19, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Another version of how the body became crooked.%} There
<>is another story also about As2t2a1vakra. Once there lived [Page065-b+ 65]
<>a sage named Asita. He did great penance to please S4iva
<>to bless him with a child. S4iva blessed him and he got a
<>son named Devala. Rambha1, the queen of devaloka, fell
<>in love with him but Devala did not yield to her wishes.
<>Then Rambha1 cursed him and made him into one with
<>eight crooks. Thus Devala came to be called As2t2a1vakra.
<>He then did penance for six thousand years and Bhaga-
<>va1n Kr2s2n2a accompanied by Ra1dha1 appeared before him.
<>Ra1dha1 was shocked by the ugliness of the sage and did
<>not relish his sight. But Kr2s2n2a asking her to remain
<>quiet went and embraced him. At once As2t2a1vakra lost
<>all his crooks and became a beautiful man. At that time
<>a chariot descended from heaven and all of them went
<>to heaven in it. (Brahmavaivartta Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%Other information.%} (1) As2t2a1vakra was also present
<>among the r2s2is who partook in the coronation ceremony
<>conducted after Ra1ma's return to Ayodhya1 from Lan3ka1.
<>(Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>(2) As2t2a1vakra cursed those. celestial maidens who re-
<>buked him for his ugliness and they were born on earth
<>as the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. When after the death of
<>Kr2s2n2a they were being taken by Arjuna to the north they
<>were forcibly taken by some of the shepherds. (Chapter
<>15, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>AS2T2A1VAKRATI1RTHA. If one observes complete fasting
<>for twelve days doing tarpan2a in this sacred pond it is
<>said that he gets the benefit of doing of Naramedha-
<>yajn5a. (S4loka 41, Chapter 25, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS2T2A1VAKTRA. See under As2t2a1vakra.

<>Ji1vaka, It2avaka, R2ddhi, Vr2ddhi (These are used in infu-
<>sions for treating rheumatism).
<HI>AS2T2AVASU(S).
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Gan2adevata1s are called As2t2avasus. They
<>were born to Dharmadeva of his wife Vasu, daughter of
<>Daks2a. They are: Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Ahar, Anila,
<>Anala, Pratyu1s2a and Prabha1sa. (S4lokas 17 and 18,
<>Chapter 66, A1di Parva, M.B.). There is a version in
<>certain pura1n2as that the As2t2avasus are the sons of
<>Kas4yapa.
<NI>Different pura1n2as give different names to these As2t2a-
<>vasus. According to Vis2n2u Pura1n2a they are: A1pa,
<>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Anala, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. (Chapter 15 of Am3s4am 1). In Bha1gavata
<>they are Dron2a, Pra1n2a, Dhruva, Arka, Agni, Dos2a,
<NI>Vasu and Vibha1vasu. In Harivam3s4a they are: Akha,
<>Dhara, Dhruva, Soma, Anila, Anala, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. This only indicates that some of these have
<>two or more names for them.
<NI>2) {%Curse of Vasis2t2ha.%} Once the As2t2avasus were enjoy-
<>ing a picnic with their wives and they happened to go
<>to the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha. One of the wives got ena-
<>moured over Nandini1, Vasis2t2ha's beautiful cow and
<>wanted it. The Vasu to please his wife took the cow by
<>force and left the place. When the sage found his cow
<>missing after some time he understood by his divine
<>powers who stole the cow and so he cursed the As2t2a-
<>vasus saying that all of them would be born on earth as
<>men. The As2t2avasus were greatly worried and approach-
<>ed the sage apologising and craving for pardon. The sage
<>relaxed the curse and declared that their life on earth
<>would be only for a very short time maintaining that
<>the particular Vasu who committed the theft would live
<>for a long time as man. It was this Vasu, A1pa (Dyau)
<>who was born as Bhi1s2ma. [Page066-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Rebirth of As2t2avasus.%} The As2t2a vasus were pondering
<>over the curse and were thinking of how to bear it
<>without hardship when Gan3ga1devi1 appeared before them
<>and they then appealed to her: “Devi1, if you become
<>the queen on earth of some noble King we shall be born
<>as your sons and you must throw us into the river as
<>soon as we are born”. Gan3ga1devi1 accepted their request.
<>Once there was a King called Prati1pa in the Candra
<>dynasty. One day when this ascetic King was worship-
<>ping Su1rya on the banks of the river Gan3ga1 a beautiful
<>damsel arose from the waters and sat on the right
<>thigh of the King. Surprised the King told her thus, “Oh
<>beautiful maiden, who are you? Do you realise what
<>unrighteous thing you have done? I am not one who
<>goes after women and it was a bit daring of you to
<>have taken me as a beau. Please understand that the
<>right thigh is intended for a daughter and daughter-in-
<>law. You can claim this right when you become the
<>wife of my son.” The beautiful girl was none other than
<>Gan3ga1devi1 herself and she disappeared soon on receiving
<>the rebuke.
<NI>Prati1pa got a son named S4antanu and Gan3ga1devi1 be-
<>came the wife of S4antanu. (For more details about this
<>see under Gan3ga1). When Gan3ga1devi1 became the wife of
<>S4antanu she made a condition to be his queen.
<>“Whether good or bad you should not obstruct any
<>action of mine. You must never give me any opinion of
<>yours on any matter. You must obey what I order. If at
<>any time you break any of these promises I will leave
<>you that instant.”
<NI>It was while Gan3ga1devi1 was living on earth as the wife
<>of S4antanu that the As2t2avasus were born to her. One
<>after the other she threw into the river seven sons but
<>when she was about to throw the eighth the King
<>objected to it and Gan3ga1 disappeared immediately. That
<>son was Bhi1s2ma, who was none other than Dyau born
<>on earth by the curse of Vasis2t2ha. All the others, released
<>from the curse, went to heaven. (More details under
<>Bhi1s2ma).
<NI>4) {%A missile to Bhi1s2ma.%} When Bhi1s2ma had to fight against
<>his guru, Paras4ura1ma, the As2t2avasus gave him the
<>missile, Prasva1pa1. (See Amba1) (S4lokas 11 to 13, Chapter
<>183, Udyoga Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Sons of As2t2avasus.%} The sons of A1pa, the first of the
<>Vasus, are: Vaitan2d2ha, S4rama, S4a1nta and Dhvani. Ka1la,
<>the destroyer of all, is the son of Dhruva. Varcas is the
<>son of Soma. Dharma got of his wife Manohari1 five sons
<>Dravin2a, Hutahavyava1ha, S4is4ira, Pra1n2a and Varun2a.
<>S4iva1 was Anila's wife and she got two sons, Manojava
<>and Avijn5a1tagati. Agni's son Kuma1ra was born at
<>S4arastamba. Kuma1ra got three brothers, S4a1kha, Vis4a1kha
<>and Naigameya. Kuma1ra is known as Ka1rttikeya
<>because he was born of Kr2ttikas. The sage, Devala is
<>the son of Pratyu1s2a. Devala got two sons of great intelli-
<>gence and forbearance. Varastri1, sister of Br2haspati and
<>a woman of great yogic powers and world-wide travels
<>became the wife of Prabha1sa. She gave birth to the
<>famous Vis4vakarmapraja1pati. He was the inventor of a
<>great many handicrafts and ornaments He became the
<>consulting architect of the devas and ranked first in that
<>art. The aeroplanes of the devas were designed by him.
<>Men on earth depend on his art even now. That archi-
<>tect had four sons: Ajaikapa1t, Ahirbudhnya, Tvas2t2a1
<>and Rudra, the bold. The great ascetics, Vis4varu1pa,
<>Hara, Bahuru1pa, Tryambaka, Apara1jita, Vr2s2a1kapi, [Page066-b+ 64]
<>S4ambhu, Kapardi, Raivata, Mr2gavya1dha, S4arva and
<>Kapa1li were the sons of Tvas2t2a1. These are known as the
<>twelve Rudras. Pura1n2as say that there are a hundred
<>Rudras like this. (Chapter 15, Am3s4a 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).

<>horse. If you do a hundred such ya1gas you can become
<>Indra.
<F>*) As4vamedha or horse sacrifice was performed by autocrats to establish their supreme sovereignty. For this the horse let out to roam
<>about should go into all countries. Those who opposed the sovereignty of the King could stop the horse and tie it. Then the King had

<>in a box the infant Karn2a. At night accompanied by
<>her maid, Kunti floated the box containing her illegiti-
<>mate son and stood on the banks of As4vanadi1 weeping
<>bitterly. Then thinking that her father would notice
<>her absence from the palace she returned home soon.
<>The box floated and reached the country, Campa1puri1,
<>ruled by a charioteer. (S4lokas 22 to 26, Chapter 308,
<>Aran2ya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VARATHA1. A river in the Gandhama1dana valley
<>flowing near the A1s4rama of the sage A1rs2t2is2en2a. Many

<HI>AS4VASENA. A serpent which lived in the forest of
<>Kha1n2d2ava. This was the son of Taks2aka and he tried
<>his best to escape from the fire that burnt the forest.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 239, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>Once when Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a were sitting on the banks
<>of the river Yamuna1, Agni approached them and request-
<>ed them to help him burn the forest of Kha1n2d2ava (see
<>under Kha1n2d2avada1ha). They agreed to help him and
<>Agni started burning the forest. Indra poured rains over
<>the fire; Arjuna created a canopy of arrows and prevent-
<>ed the rains from falling down. As4vasena, son of
<>Taks2aka tried to escape from the fire but Arjuna obs-
<>tructed his way by arrows. Then As4vasena's mother
<>swallowed him and kept him in her stomach. Arjuna
<>cut off her head. Seeing this Indra sent a cyclone to
<>smash the canopy of arrows and Arjuna fell fainting.
<>Taking the opportunity As4vasena escaped. When Arjuna
<>woke up from his unconscious state he found As4vasena
<>missing. Then Arjuna cursed him thus: “Let not you
<>get refuge anywhere.” (Chapter 226, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>As4vasena kept his grudge against Arjuna till the end.
<>In the great battle Arjuna and Karn2a met for a fight
<>and when Karn2a sent his Na1ga1stra (serpent missile)
<>against Arjuna, As4vasena hid himself in that missile
<>and burnt the beautiful headwear of Arjuna. But Karn2a
<>did not like this foul play and refused to accept him
<>when he came back. Enraged at this the serpent attacked
<>Arjuna directly and was killed. Before his death he got
<>acquainted with Kr2s2n2a. (Chapter 96, Karn2a Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AS4VAS4IRAS I. A son born to Kas4yapa of Danu1. (S4loka

<>the Vedas at Vaiha1yasakun2d2a near Narana1ra1yan2a1s4rama.
<>(S4loka 3, Chapter 127, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VAS4IRASTHA1NA(M). A sacred place in ancient
<>India. Arjuna dreams of going to S4iva with Kr2s2n2a and
<>in that dream they visit this place also. (Chapter 80,
<>Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VA1TAKA. A country of ancient India. (S4loka 15,
<>Chapter 51, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VATARA. A serpent. A sacred pond built in Praya1ga
<>also carries this name. (S4loka 76, Chapter 55, Vana
<>Parva and S4loka 10, Chapter 35, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>AS4VATI1RTHA. An ancient holy place on the banks of
<>the river, Ganges, near Kanauj. It was at this place
<>that the horses rose from the earth at the request of
<>R2ci1ka R2s2i to Varun2a (See under As4vakr2ta). (S4loka
<>17, Chapter 4, M.B.)
<HI>AS4VATTHA1MA1.
<NI>1) {%Birth and genealogy.%} The semen of Bharadva1ja R2s2i
<>fell into the hollow of a bamboo and from there was
<>born Dron2a. As per the instructions of his father Dron2a
<>married Kr2pi1, daughter of the sage, S4a1radvata. The
<>good-natured Kr2pi1 gave birth to As4vattha1ma1. (See
<>under Dron2a for genealogy). (Chapter 130, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.)
<NI>2) {%How he got his name.%} The moment he was born he
<>made a loud hoot like Uccais4ravas and the sound resem-
<>bled the braying of a horse. Immediately a voice from
<>heaven said that the boy should be named As4vattha1ma1. [Page068-b+ 65]
<>The boy was, therefore, named so. (S4lokas 48 and 49,
<>Chapter 130, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Training in archery.%} As4vattha1ma1 took his lesson in
<>archery from his father Dron2a. At that time Dron2a got
<>new lessons from Paras4ura1ma and they were also im-
<>parted to Dron2a's disciples. When Dron2a became the
<>preceptor of the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas As4vattha1ma1
<>also went with him. (S4lokas 52 to 64, Chapter 130, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Dron2a's affection for his son.%} Dron2a was very affec-
<>tionate to his son and wanted to teach him something
<>special in archery. So he used to instruct him during
<>the time the other disciples went to fetch water for the
<>a1s4rama. Arjuna came to know of this and he, there-
<>after, started bringing his quota of water quickly
<>enough to join the special class of Dron2a. Thus Arjuna
<>and As4vattha1ma1 learned a lot more than the others in
<>the military art. (S4lokas 17-19, Chapter 132, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%The Maha1bha1rata Battle and As4vattha1ma1.%} In Sabha1
<>Parva we find As4vattha1ma1 participating in the Ra1ja-
<>su1ya of Yudhis2t2hira. After that we meet him only at
<>the Kuruks2etra war. Fighting on the side of the Kau-
<>ravas he played a very important role in that war. He
<>killed many veteran warriors and kings including the
<>following: Ni1la, An5janaparva1, Suratha, S4atrun5jaya,
<>Bala1ni1ka, Jaya1ni1ka, Jaya1s4va, Sruta1s4va, Hemama1li1, Vr2s2a-
<>dhara, Candrasena, the ten sons of Kuntibhoja, Sudar-
<>s4ana, Vr2ddhaks2etra, Cedira1ja, Malayadhvaja and Sura-
<>tha. He defeated many including S4ikhan2d2i1, Abhimanyu,
<>Vira1t2a, Sa1tyaki and Vindhya. By using A1gneya1stra
<>(the arrow of fire) he made Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna fall
<>fainting in the battle-field. He commanded the Kaurava
<>army once. He killed many Pa1n5ca1las and Somakas
<>while they were sleeping. In Chapter 139 of Dron2a
<>Parva we read about Arjuna defeating As4vattha1ma1 in
<>a single combat one day.
<NI>6) {%As4vattha1ma1 sees a ghost.%} Dhr2s2t2adyumna, son of King
<>Pa1n5ca1la, killed Dron2a. When As4vattha1ma1 heard of
<>his father's death his rage knew no bound. He imme-
<>diately went to the heart of the military camp of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas, Kr2pa and Sa1tvata following him. There at the
<>gate of the camp he beheld a ghostly apparition. It is
<>described in the Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata (Malaya1lam version of
<>M.B.) as follows: He saw a huge figure standing at the
<>door with a body blazing like the Sun and the Moon.
<>Bathed in blood and wearing a tiger's skin in the loins
<>the figure wore a snake as his sacred thread and cover-
<>ed his upper body with a deer-skin. There were innu-
<>merable hands for this ghost and in each hand adorned
<>with snake-bangles he held a deadly weapon. With
<>crooked teeth and a ghastly face the goblin gave a
<>shiver to those who saw him. Flames bursting forth
<>from his eyes, ears, nose and mouth he barred the way
<>of As4vattha1ma1. Undaunted the son of Dron2a showered
<>divine arrows on the figure. But the ghost by his sup-
<>reme powers absorbed the arrows to his body the
<>moment they touched him. In despair As4vattha1ma1
<>meditated on S4iva and the latter appearing before him
<>in person gave him a divine dagger. With that he entered
<>the bed-chamber of Dhr2s2t2adyumna, woke him up by
<>striking him with his foot, caught hold of him by the
<>hair on his head and killed him.
<NI>7) {%As4vattha1ma1 and his jewel.%} The anger of As4yattha1ma1 did
<>not abate even after killing Dhr2s2t2adyumna, the butcher [Page069-a+ 65]
<>of his father. With a view to destroying the whole Pa1n2d2-
<>ava dynasty he sent against the Pa1n2d2avas the all-power-
<>ful Brahmas4ira1stra (a missile charged with great power
<>by a holy incantation). But Dron2a had given the same
<>type of missile to Arjuna also and so he sent forth his to
<>meet the other. It created such a great explosion that
<>all the elders on both the sides joined together and re-
<>quested them to withdraw the missiles. Arjuna demanded
<>the jewel on As4vattha1ma1's head to withdraw his missile.
<>But As4vattha1ma1 refused to part with it. He said, “This
<>jewel of mine is more valuable than all the wealth of both
<>Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas put together. If you wear this
<>you need not be afraid of your enemies, disease, hunger
<>and thirst. No harm will come to you from Yaks2as,
<>Na1gas or thieves. I will never part with such a jewel”.
<>(S4lokas 28-30, M.B., Chapter 15, Sautika Parva). After
<>great persuasion As4vattha1ma1 surrendered his jewel but
<>without withdrawing the missile directed it towards the
<>womb of Uttara1 who was bearing a child then. We
<>are reminded of an incident which happened when
<>the Pa1n2d2avas were residing in Upapla1vya; a poor
<>brahmin looking at Uttara1 said, “When the Kauravas
<>will be weakening in power a child will be born to you.
<>The boy will have to bear a test even while in the
<>womb and so you must name the child Pari1ks2it (One
<>who has been tested)”.
<NI>When the powerful missile was flying straight towards
<>Uttara1's womb S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a said, “Even though the child
<>in the womb will die of this arrow it will be reborn.
<>Oh, As4vattha1ma1, you will be denounced by all as a
<>sinner for killing this unborn babe. To suffer for this
<>evil deed you will roam about in the earth for three
<>thousand years. Nobody will associate with you; you will
<>be shunned by society. You will be tormented by all
<>diseases on earth. But the babe which you have now
<>killed will be a famous scholar and brave King. He will
<>rule this country for sixty years. He will be known
<>as the next Kurura1ja. Look, I am giving life to the babe
<>you have killed”. Vya1sa supported Kr2s2n2a, and As4vat-
<>tha1ma1 repenting on his hasty action gave the jewel to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas and left for the forest with Vya1sa.
<>(Sautika Parva, M.B.).

<>As4viani1kuma1ras. (S4lokas 17 and 18, Chapter 150, Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, M.B.). They are also known as As4vins, [Page069-b+ 65]
<>and As4vini1devas. These two are the physicians

<>Brahma1, Mari1ci, Kas4yapa, Vivasva1n (the Sun),
<>As4vini1kuma1ras.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a describes the birth thus:
<>“Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1, was the wife of
<>Su1rya. She got three children: Manu, Yama and Yami1.
<>Once finding the effulgence of Su1rya unbearable she
<>engaged Cha1ya1 to look after Su1rya and left for the
<>forests to do penance there. Su1rya took Cha1ya1 to be
<>Sam3jn5a1 and got three children of her: S4anais4cara,
<>(another) Manu and Tapati1. Once Cha1ya1 got angry
<>and cursed Yama. It was then that Su1rya and Yama
<>came to know that she was not Sam3jn5a1, getting more
<>details from Cha1ya1, Su1rya found out by his Jn5a1nadr2s2t2i
<>(a power of sight developed by Yoga by which one
<>could see things far beyond the limits of his vision)
<>that Sam3jn5a1 was practising austerities taking the form of
<>a mare. Then Su1rya went to her disguised as a horse
<>and with her co-operation produced three children of
<>which the first two became known as As4vini1kuma1ras. The
<>third son was called Revanta. Then Su1rya took Sam3jn5a1
<>to his place (Chapter 2, Am3s4a 3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<>S4loka 35 of Chapter 66 of A1di Parva states that As4vini1-
<>kuma1ras were born from the nose of Sam3jn5a1.
<NI>3) {%How As4vini1kuma1ras tested Sukanya1.%} The Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata contains a story of how the As4vini1kuma1ras tested
<>the fidelity of Sukanya1, daughter of S4arya1ti and made
<>her old and senile husband into a young and virile one.
<>S4arya1ti, son of Vaivasvata manu, had four thousand
<>beautiful princesses as wives. But none had any child-
<>ren. When they were lamenting over this misfortune
<>one of the wives gave birth to a girl and she was called
<>Sukanya1. The father and all his wives together brought
<>up this daughter with great affection.
<NI>In the neighbourhood of the palace of S4arya1ti there was
<>a tapovana as good and grand as Nandanavana and it
<>contained a lake similar to the Ma1nasa lake. In one
<>corner of this tapovana a sage named Cyavana was
<>doing penance. He had been sitting there for so long a
<>period without food meditating on a goddess that he was
<>covered with plants and shrubs had grown over him. He
<>was unaware of the growth around him. Once at this
<>time S4arya1ti with his wives and child and followed by a
<>large retinue entered the tapovana for recreation. The
<>King and his wives entered the lake and Sukanya1 with
<>her friends moved about in the garden plucking flowers
<>and playing. Moving about thus aimlessly Sukanya1 and
<>party reached the place where Cyavana was doing
<>penance. She saw the huge shrubby growth and while
<>looking at it saw two gleaming points inside the shrubby
<>heap. She was about to break open the thing when from
<>inside she heard somebody addressing her thus: “Oh,
<>innocent girl, why do you think of doing this mischief.
<>Please do go your way. I am an ascetic. What wrong
<>have I done to you for you to disturb me like this?” But
<>Sukanya1 brought up as she was, as a very pet girl did
<>not like anybody advising her like this and so taking a
<>pointed stick gave two pricks at the site of the gleam-
<>points and left the place arrogantly.
<NI>The gleam-points were the eyes of Cyavana and so he
<>lost his eyes and suffered much from the pain. Though
<>he felt angry he did not curse anybody. But slowly the [Page070-a+ 65]
<>country began to witness the evil effects of this cruel
<>deed. People stopped passing urine or faeces. Even
<>animals were affected. The King and his ministers were
<>worried. People came on deputation to the King to
<>describe the disaster that had gripped the state. The
<>King began to doubt that somebody must have done some
<>great injury to the sage, Cyavana. He started enquiries
<>asking his subjects one by one about this. But everybody
<>replied in the negative. He bribed, he threatened. The
<>result was the same. Then one day while the King and
<>his courtiers were sitting despondent Sukanya1 approach-
<>ed her father and confessed what she had done. She
<>said: “While I was playing with my friends in the
<>tapovana I saw this huge shrub-heap and two points
<>gleaming from inside. I took a pin-stick and pricked
<>them both and on drawing it out I found it wet also.
<>But I left the matter there and never made any
<>enquiries thereafter”. S4arya1ti now knew the cause of this
<>national disaster and so immediately rushed to the sage
<>for forgiveness. Prostrating before the r2s2i the King pleaded
<>“Oh, best of r2s2is, forgive us for this injury done unknow-
<>ingly. My daughter who is only an innocent child did
<>this playfully while she was playing in this garden with
<>her friends. She never knew what she pricked for a fun
<>were your eyes. Oh, the best of sage, thou art rich in
<>forgiveness and so please do condone this mischief and
<>bless us.” Cyavana replied that he would forgive if he
<>gave Sukanya1 in marriage to him. S4arya1ti was depressed.
<>How could he give his only and beautiful daughter to
<>this aged senile ugly and blind r2s2i? While the King was
<>thus pondering over this, Sukanya1 herself came to him
<>and said, “Oh, dear father, please do not worry on
<>my account. I shall go as his wife. If he is satisfied
<>the nation would be saved from a calamity and I am
<>prepared to sacrifice my happiness for the sake of the
<>country. I will be only too glad to do so.” With suppress-
<>ed unwillingness the King gave his daughter in marri-
<>age to Cyavana.
<NI>Sukanya1 after her marriage engaged herself fully in the
<>service of looking after the welfare of her husband. She
<>gave her husband healthy and tasty fruits and vegeta-
<>bles, bathed him daily in hot water, placed before him
<>all the materials for his pu1ja1 and when the time came
<>for his meals gave him his food sitting by his side. After
<>the meals she gave him ta1mbu1la and only after putting
<>him on a bed would she go to attend to her own affairs.
<>After finishing her meals she would come again to her
<>husband and sit by his side massaging him. In the even-
<>ing she would make ready all the things required for the
<>pu1ja1 and after the pu1ja1 feed him with nourishing food.
<>Whatever remained after his feed would be taken by her.
<>At night she would be at the foot of her husband and
<>take a nap. In the morning she would attend to all the
<>details of the ablutions of her husband. Thus Sukanya1
<>lived true to her husband always anxious to please him.
<>Then one day the As4vini1kuma1ras saw her going to the
<>a1s4rama after her bath. They were very much attracted
<>by the stunning beauty of the maiden that they approach-
<>ed her and asked: “Oh, beautiful maiden, who are you?
<>We are As4vini1kuma1ras. You seem to be alone. How did
<>you happen to come to this place? You are one who
<>should always move about with friends and courtiers
<>and what is the reason for your living like this?”
<>Sukanya1 replied, “Revered Devas, I am the daughter of
<>S4arya1ti and wife of Cyavana. Forced by certain circum- [Page070-b+ 65]
<>stances my father gave me in marriage to this sage who
<>is very old and blind. He is living in the a1s4rama nearby.
<>I am living with him looking after his comfort. If you
<>think it convenient you can come and accept our
<>hospitality.” Hearing this the As4vini1kuma1ras told her
<>thus: “Sweet girl, you are fit to be the wife of one who
<>is better than this blind old ascetic. So please do accept
<>one of us as your husband”. Sukanya1 did not relish
<>this talk and threatening them that if they did not with-
<>draw stopping such blabbering she would curse them
<>to ashes. The As4vini1devas were a bit surprised and also
<>frightened at the attitude of Sukanya1. “Oh, Princess,
<>we are immensely pleased at your sense of righteousness
<>and chastity and you can ask of us a boon. We are
<>physicians of the devas and can give your husband his
<>sight and can also make him young and virile. But there
<>is a condition for this. As soon as your husband be-
<>comes young and handsome we will also become like
<>him and then you can select one among us. Are you
<>willing? If so we will make your husband charming and
<>handsome at this instant.
<NI>Sukanya1 was well pleased with this offer but the condi-
<>tion placed did not satisfy her. So she ran to the a1s4rama
<>and told her husband thus: “Lord, I met the As4vini1-
<>devas on my way from the river after my bath and
<>enamoured of my beauty they have made this offer. We
<>will make your husband young and beautiful giving him
<>back his eyesight and then we will change ourselves to
<>resemble him. You have then to select one of us as your
<>husband. I am not able to understand their cunning and
<>so I have come to you to get from you the answer for
<>their question. I am anxious to see you young and hand-
<>some with your eyesight regained. I shall do as you
<>direct.”
<NI>Cyavana said: “There is nothing in this for great think-
<>ing. You go and tell them that you would do as they
<>wish and bring them down here. On hearing this Sukanya1
<>went to the As4vini1kuma1ras and took them to the a1s4rama.
<>They asked Cyavana to take a dip in the lake nearby
<>and as he entered the lake the As4vini1devas also entered
<>it and took a dip in its waters along with Cyavana. Lo!
<>As they rose from the waters all the three became young
<>and handsome looking alike. The As4vini1devas then
<>requested Sukanya1 to select one among them. Sukanya1
<>was in a fix and she prayed to her goddess to give her
<>power to identify her husband. She was blessed with
<>that power and she selected Cyavana from the lot at
<>which the As4vini1devas were also pleased. (Seventh
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Cyavana's gratitude.%} Cyavana who got back his eye-
<>sight and youth asked the As4vini1kuma1ras what boon
<>they wanted. They then told him thus: “We are the
<>physicians of the devas. Devendra has unnecessarily put
<>a ban on our drinking Soma (juice extracted from the
<>creeper Soma). When Brahma1 performed a ya1ga at
<>Maha1meru this leader of the devas did not allow us to
<>take a soma drink. If you are capable of doing it you
<>should get us the right to take this celestial drink.”
<>Cyavana promised to do that.
<NI>Before long, King S4arya1ti and his wife came to the
<>a1s4rama to enquire about the welfare of their daughter.
<>To their great amazement they found a young and hand-
<>some ascetic at the a1s4rama and were a bit suspicious of
<>the character of their daughter. But soon all doubts were
<>cleared and they were immensely pleased. Cyavana then [Page071-a+ 65]
<>told the King the request of the As4vini1devas and S4arya1ti
<>also promised his help on this matter.
<NI>On their return to their palace S4arya1ti decided to per-
<>form a big ya1ga to which all the devas were also invited.
<>Cyavana officiated as priest. The As4vini1devas were also
<>present quite to the dislike of Indra. The time came for
<>distributing soma, and when Cyavana called the As4vini1-
<>kuma1ras to take their share Indra objected saying that
<>since they were physicians of the devas they could not
<>be given that drink. Cyavana argued against that and
<>after a great verbal combat Cyavana succeeded in
<>making the As4vini1kuma1ras take the drink. For more
<>details look under ‘Cyavana’. (Seventh Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Other information regarding As4vini1kuma1ras.%}
<NI>(1) How they tested Upamanyu. This story is given
<>under the word A1podadhaumya.
<NI>(2) Birth of Nakula and Sahadeva. Kunti1, wife of Pa1n2d2u,
<>had obtained from Sage Durva1sas five sacred mantras,
<>the chanting of each of which would give her a child.
<NI>Even before her marriage Kunti1 tested the power of the
<>mantras by chanting one of them. Su1rya appeared and
<>she had to take a son from him who became the famous
<>Karn2a later. By chanting the second, third and fourth
<>meditating on Yama, Va1yu and Indra, Kunti1 got
<>respectively the sons Dharmaputra, Bhi1ma and Arjuna.
<>The fifth mantra she gave to Ma1dri1 and she meditated
<>on the As4vini1devas and got Nakula and Sahadeva.
<NI>(3) The As4vini1devas were present for the marriage of
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. (S4loka 6, Chapter 186, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>During the burning of the forest Kha1n2d2ava the As4vini1-
<>devas stood on the side of Arjuna.
<NI>(4) King Yuvana1s4va became pregnant and bore a child.
<>It was the As4vini1devas who took the child out by surgery.
<>The boy became known as Ma1ndha1ta1 later. (S4loka 3,

<NI>(5) During the Maha1bha1rata battle the As4vini1devas
<>handed over some Pa1rs2adas to the god, Skanda. (S4loka

<NI>(6) The As4vini1devas like very much oblations of Ghee.
<>The others who like it are Br2haspati, Pu1s2an, Bhaga and
<>Pa1vaka. (S4loka 7, Chapter 65, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(7) The month of A1s4vina (October-November) is the
<>month of As4vini1kuma1ras and if a man gives ghee to the
<>Brahmins freely in that month he will acquire more
<>physical beauty. (S4loka 10, Chapter 65, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(8) One who offers Ghee as oblation to the fire for
<>twelve months in succession will reach the country of
<>the As4vini1kuma1ras. (S4loka 95, Chapter 107, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(9) The great poet of Kerala, Vallathol, in his com-
<>mentary on the 93rd Su1kta of the R2gveda states that
<>there is a belief that the As4vins and Candrasu1ryas (the
<>Sun and Moon) are one and the same.
<NI>(10) Di1rghas4ravas son of Di1rghatamas once prayed to
<>the As4vini1devas to get rains and it is said that they gave
<>a downpour of sweet water. (R2gveda, Su1kta 112, R2k 11).
<NI>(11) Once a sage named Gotama was lost in a desert
<>and craved bitterly for drinking water. He prayed to the
<>As4vini1devas for water and they dug a well itself in the
<>desert and quenched the thirst of the sage. (R2k 9, Su1kta
<>16, R2gveda).
<NI>(12) The sage Dadhyan5c taught the As4vini1devas the
<>technique, Madhuvidya1. There is an interesting story [Page071-b+ 65]
<>about it. It was Indra who taught this to Dadhyan5c
<>and while teaching him he had threatened that if he
<>gave away that secret to anybody else his head would
<>be cut off. As4vini1devas found a way to tide over this
<>difficulty. They at first cut off his head and fixed the
<>head of a horse on him. It was with the head of a
<>horse that Dadhyan5c taught them Madhuvidya1 and
<>as soon as the teaching was over his horse-head was
<>cut off and the real head placed in its place. (R2k 22,
<>Su1kta 116, R2gveda).
<NI>(13) The vehicle of the As4vini1devas is a donkey.
<>Once this donkey in the disguise of a wolf went and
<>stayed with R2jra1s4va, son of the Ra1jar2s2i Vr2s2a1gi1r. R2jra1-
<>s4va gave the wolf to eat hundred goats belonging to
<>the people of the place. Vr2s2a1gi1r got angry at this act
<>of his son and cursed him. The son became blind and
<>he got back his eyesight by pleasing the As4vini1devas
<>by prayer and offerings. (R2k 16, Su1kta 115, R2g-
<>veda).
<NI>(14) Once Surya1 decided to give his daughter in
<>marriage to the owner of the horse which would win a
<>horse-race which Surya1 would conduct. In the race the
<>horse of the As4vini1devas won and they thus married
<>Su1rya1's daughter. (R2k 17, Su1kta 117, R2gveda).
<NI>(15) The As4vini1kuma1ras killed an asura of name
<>Vis2vak and destroyed his dynasty also. (R2k 16, Su1kta

<HI>AS4VINI1KUMA1RATI1RTHA. It is believed that the
<>physical beauty of man would be increased if he bath-
<>es in this lake. (S4loka 17, Chapter 83, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>AS4VINI1SUTA. A son born to Su1rya of the wife of
<>Sutapas. There is this story about it in Brahmavai-
<>varta Pura1n2a. Once when the wife of Sutapas was on
<>a pilgrimage Su1rya happened to see her. The beautiful
<>and venerable lady refused to accede to the desire of
<>Su1rya and so the latter used force and took her. They
<>had a son who was named As4vini1suta. On her return
<>after the pilgrimage with her son she explained all that
<>happened and the sage sent both of them out. Su1rya
<>taught his son As4vini1suta astrology and made him a
<>master in that science. Knowing that, Sutapas cursed
<>him and said he would turn to be one very diseased.
<>Later the sage amended his curse and added that he
<>would be free from disease if he worshipped the sun.
<HI>ASVINI1TI1RTHA. Promises bodily splendour if one
<>takes a bath in this lake. (S4loka 21, Chapter 25,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>ATALA. This is one of the seven sections of Pa1ta1la. The
<>seven sections are: Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Tala1tala,
<>Maha1tala, Rasa1tala, Pa1ta1la. Of them Atala has been
<>described as follows: Atala is the first world of Pa1ta1la.
<>There reigns Bala, the son of Maya who is the famous
<>but haughty magician. He has created 96 Mayas who
<>are capable of granting all kinds of desires. Even now
<>certain persons who are interested in the practice of
<>Black magic, learn some of these 96 arts and practise
<>them. When this mighty fellow opens his mouth for
<>yawning, three groups of women known as Pum3s4cali1s,
<>Svairin2i1s and Ka1mini1s emerge from his mouth. He has
<>with him a rasa1yana called ha1t2aka with which he can
<>eaisly entice and seduce all who enter Atala and to
<>strengthen them for satisfying his lust. After enticing
<>them with it, he enjoys uncontrolled pleasure with
<>them, showering on them his amorous glances, bewitch- [Page072-a+ 63]
<>ing smiles and embraces. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama
<>Skandha).
<HI>AT2AVI1S4IKHARA. Name of a village in ancient India.
<>(M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 48).
<HI>ATHARVA(M). Among the Vedas, this has the fourth
<>place. It comprises different kinds of incantations of
<>occult powers for the destruction of enemies. Atharvan
<>the son of Vasis2t2ha was the author of this Veda. In
<>Chapter 6 of the third section of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a the
<>following reference is made to Atharvaveda: “Sumantu
<>Mahars2i who was of infinite glory, first taught this
<>Atharvaveda to his disciple Kabandha. (Sumantu
<>Mahars2i was the son of Jaimini, who was the disciple
<>of Vedavya1sa). Kabandha divided Atharvaveda into
<>two parts and communicated them to two Mahars2is
<>named Devadars4a and Pathya. Devadars4a's disciples
<>were: Medha1, Brahmabali, S4autka1yani and Pippala1da.
<>Pathya had three disciples named Ja1ba1li, Kumuda1di
<>and S4aunaka. They also made Atharvaveda compila-
<>tions. S4aunaka divided his compilation into two and
<>gave one part to Babhru and the other to Saindhava.
<>Mun5jikes4a learnt it from Saindhava and divided the
<>compilation first into two and later into three parts.
<>The five divisions of the Atharvaveda--Naks2atrakalpa,
<>Vedakalpa, Sam3hita1kalpa, A1n3girasakalpa and S4a1nti-
<>kalpa, were made by Mun5jikes4a. Naks2atrakalpa con-
<>tains Brahma's works: Sam3hita1kalpa contains Mantra
<>Vidhi; A1ngirasakalpa contains a1bhica1ra and S4a1ntikalpa
<>contains taming of horses, elephants etc.

<NI>When these mantras are chanted several oblations are
<>made to the sacrificial fire. Substances like Camata1, ghee,
<>rice, milk are thrown into the fire as offerings. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 262).
<HI>ATHARVA1 I. This muni is referred to in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, Verse 50, as a professional
<>chanter of Chandaveda. Once under the curse of Bhr2gu
<>Mahars2i, Agni hid himself under the sea. (See “AGNI”).
<>At that time, it was Atharva1 who, at the suggestion of
<>the Devas, went under the water and discovered Agni.
<>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 8).
<NI>Atharva1 recovered Agni, and re-created the worlds
<>which were lying dormant owing to the absence of fire.
<>(M.B., Vana Parva, Chapter 222, Verse 19).
<NI>Atharva1 was born from Brahma1's face. His wife was
<>S4a1nti, the daughter of Kardama. Citti was another
<>name for S4a1nti. But there are some Pura1n2as which re-
<>fer to Citti as another wife of Atharva1. Also, there are
<>Pura1n2as which say that Atharva1 was An3giras himself.
<HI>ATHARVA1 II. This name has been used as a synonym
<>of S4iva. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 17, Verse
<>91).
<HI>ATHARVA1 III. In R2gveda another Atharva1 may be
<>seen. It is said that he was the author of the Atharva-
<>veda. After learning Brahmavidya1 from Brahma1, it
<>was this Atharva1 who first brought fire to the earth
<>from heaven. Atharva1 had two wives named S4a1nti and
<>Citti. This Atharva1 was the same person as Atharvan2a,
<>the son of Vasis2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha, Chap-
<>ter 1).
<HI>ATHARVA1N3GIRAS. See AN3GIRAS.
<HI>ATHARVAN2A. A son of Vasis2t2ha. (Bha1gavata, Fourth
<>Skandha, Verse 42).
<HI>AT2HIDA(M). Name of a Janastha1na (Town) in ancient

<HI>ATIBA1HU. He was a Gandharva born to Kas4yapa by
<>his wife Pradha1. He had three brothers: Ha1ha1, Hu1hu1
<>and Tumburu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse
<>51).
<HI>ATIBALA. A mantra. Vis4va1mitra who took the boys
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to the forest taught them two
<>mantras, Bala and Atibala, to liberate them from
<>hunger and thirst. Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 22)
<HI>ATIBALA I. The Mahars2i Atibala was the cause of the
<>death of S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a.
<NI>After the war with Ra1van2a, S4ri1 Ra1ma returned to Ayo-
<>dhya1 with his retinue and began his reign. After re-
<>nouncing Si1ta1 while S4ri1 Ra1ma was living in the palace
<>with Laks2man2a, S4atrughna and their families, one day
<>Brahma1 summoned Yama and said: “S4ri1 Ra1ma is the
<>incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. He has fulfilled all the pur-
<>poses of the incarnation. Now Vis2n2u has to be recalled
<>to Vaikun2t2ha”.
<NI>On hearing this, Yama assuming the guise of a Sanny-
<>a1si named Atibala appeared before S4ri1 Ra1ma. He said
<>he had to tell a secret to S4ri1 Ra1ma. Accordingly S4ri1
<>Ra1ma sent everyone else out of the audience chamber. [Page073-a+ 65]
<>Laks2man2a was asked to guard the entrance. It was
<>announced that if anyone entered the hall, Laks2man2a
<>would be killed.
<NI>At this stage, Mahars2i Durva1sas arrived at the entrance
<>accompanied by many of his disciples. He had come
<>after having performed penance for a thousand years
<>and in great hunger and thirst. He wanted to see the
<>King to ask for sumptuous food. Laks2man2a requested
<>him to wait a little but Durva1sas refused to do so. He
<>even threatened that he would reduce all of them to
<>ashes by his curse. Finding no alternative, Laks2man2a
<>entered the hall and informed S4ri1 Ra1ma of the situation.
<>Durva1sas was given a sumptuous meal. But for the ful-
<>filment of the condition Laks2man2a's death became neces-
<>sary. S4ri1 Ra1ma cried with a broken heart. The honest
<>Laks2man2a went alone to the Sarayu1 river and drowned
<>himself in its depths. Soon after, S4ri1 Ra1ma entrusting
<>the affairs of the state to others and in the presence of
<>thousands of spectators plunged into the Sarayu1 river
<>and renouncing his earthly life, returned to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>ATIBALA II. The name of a follower given to Skanda
<>by god Va1yu on the battle-field. (M.B., S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Verse 44).
<HI>ATIBALA III. There was another King named Atibala
<>who was a great scholar in Ni1tis4a1stra. From the tine
<>of his accession to the throne, he began to lead a
<>vicious life. This Atibala's father was a King named
<>Anan3ga. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 59, Verse 92).
<HI>ATIBHI1MA. One of the sons of the Agni, Tapa. (M.B.,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 220, Verse 11).
<HI>ATIKA1YA. One of the sons of Ra1van2a.
<NI>1) {%Previous Birth.%} This is a story concerning the initial
<>stage of the creation of the Universe. After completing
<>the task of creation Brahma1, in his pride fell into a sleep.
<>In order to slight Brahma1 a little, Maha1vis2n2u produced
<>two Ra1ks2asas called Madhu and Kait2abha from his ears.
<>Hearing their terrible roar Brahma1 woke up in fear and
<>fled to Maha1vis2n2u seeking refuge. Vis2n2u called Madhu
<>and Kait2abha and asked them what boon they
<>would like to ask. They proudly replied that they would
<>grant a boon to Vis2n2u. In that case Maha1vis2n2u wanted
<>them to grant him leave to kill them. They answered:
<>“We will not break our promise about granting the
<>boon. But since our passion for fighting has not been
<>abated, you must fulfil our eager desire.” Maha1vis2n2u
<>said: “I agree. But let my boon be carried out first.
<>After that I shall see that your wish is properly fulfill-
<>ed. After your death, one of you will be reborn under
<>the name of Khara and the other under the name of
<>Atika1ya. In the Treta1yuga I shall kill Khara in single
<>combat after allaying his passion for fighting. Laks2man2a
<>who is the incarnation of Ananta will fight with
<>Atika1ya to his full satisfaction and kill him. Thus both
<>of you will get Virakti and Mukti.”
<NI>After saying this, Maha1vis2n2u made the two asuras
<>stand on each of his thighs and killed them with his
<>Sudars4ana Cakra. They were born again as Khara and
<>Atika1ya. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is a story about the birth of Atika1ya
<>in the Yuddha Ka1n2d2a of Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a: After
<>his victory over Kubera Ra1van2a was returning in his
<>Pus2paka Vima1na. On his way he saw some beautiful
<>Gandharva women playing in the valley of Mayu1ragiri.
<>Their leader was Citra1n3gi1, the wife of Citra1n3gada. [Page073-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a seduced her and had a secret union with her. At
<>once she became pregnant and gave birth to a dazzlingly
<>bright baby. The mother handed over the child to
<>Ra1van2a and returned to the world of the Gandharvas.
<>Ra1van2a, in his paternal love, took the child into the
<>Vima1na and proceeded. On the way, the Vima1na
<>knocked against a mountain peak and the baby was
<>thrown overboard and fell in the forest. Ra1van2a stop-
<>ped the Vima1na and made a search for the baby in the
<>forest. He found the child without the slightest injury,
<>smiling and lying on a flat rock in the deep woods. He
<>failed in his attempt to take it up even though he used
<>ten of his hands. The child began to grow steadily in
<>size. Then he tried again to lift the baby up using all
<>his twenty arms. The boy, who had by this time grown
<>into enormous size, suddenly sprang up and getting in-
<>to the Vima1na took his seat in it. Ra1van2a gave him the
<>name Atika1ya. On his arrival in Lan3ka1, he presented
<>him as adopted son to the barren Dhanyama1la1.
<>Atika1ya was brought up by Dhanyama1la1.
<NI>3) {%The Boons.%} Atika1ya went to Gokarn2a and did pe-
<>nance to please Brahma1. Brahma1 appeared, but being
<>fully absorbed in Sama1dhi, Atika1ya was not aware of
<>his presence. Even his life-breath had been stopped.
<>Brahma1, by his power, instilled life-breath into him and
<>restored him to consciousness. He granted Atika1ya all
<>the boons he asked for. They were three in number.
<>The first was the gift of Brahma1stra which could smash
<>anyone. The second was the gift of an armour which
<>was unassailable by anyone. The third was absence of
<>thirst, desire and other cravings.
<NI>4) {%Education.%} Atika1ya went to Kaila1sa and received
<>his education from S4iva. He learnt all the sciences,
<>Arts, S4ruti, Smr2ti etc. from there. On the completion
<>of his course he asked what Gurudaks2in2a1 he should
<>pay. S4iva made him promise that he would never
<>practise Black magic. Pleased with him, S4iva awarded
<>him the Pa1s4upata1stra.
<NI>5) {%Victory in Battle.%} Atika1ya had an uncle, a Ra1ks2asa
<>named Candra. Once he was defeated by Indra. It was
<>at this time of chagrin that he came to know that
<>Atika1ya had reached Lan3ka1 with the Pa1s4upata1stra.
<>Candra Ra1ks2asa ordered Atika1ya to bring Indra as a
<>captive. Atika1ya went to Svarga (Heaven) and began
<>a war with Indra. Maha1vis2n2u who came to help Indra
<>used his Sudars4ana cakra. Atika1ya shot his Pa1s4u-
<>pata1stra. Knowing Atika1ya's history well, Maha1vis2n2u
<>brought the battle to a close. Both parties accepted the
<>position that Devendra had lost the battle and Atika1ya
<>had won.
<NI>6) {%Death.%} In the Ra1ma1yan2a battle Atika1ya fought
<>on the side of Ra1van2a. After a most terrible conflict,
<>Laks2man2a killed Atika1ya. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>ATILOMA1. An Asura who was killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>ATIMANYU. He was one of the ten sons of Manu.
<HI>ATIRATHA. There was a King named Matina1ra in
<>Pu1ruvam3s4a. (See PU1RUVAM3S4A). Four sons were born
<>to him: Tam3su, Maha1n, Atiratha and Druhyu. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 14).
<HI>ATIRA1TRA. He was one of the ten children born to
<>Manu by Nad2vala1. (See MANU VAM3S4A). Kuru,
<>Pu1ru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2t2oma,
<>Atira1tra, Sudyumna and Atimanyu were the names of [Page074-a+ 65]
<>the ten brilliant sons of Nad2vala1. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part
<>I, Chapter 13).
<HI>ATIS2AN2D2A. After his death Balabhadra Ra1ma went
<>to Pa1ta1la in the guise of Ananta. All the serpents wor-
<>shipped him. Among them was a serpent named Ati-
<>s2an2d2a. (M.B., Mausala Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<HI>ATIS4R2N3GA. Vindhya Presented two pa1rs2adas to Skanda
<>on the battlefield. They were Atis4r2n3ga and Ucchr2n3ga.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verses 49, 50).
<HI>ATISTHIRA. Maha1meru presented two Pa1rs2adas nam-
<>ed Atisthira and Sthira to Skanda on the battlefield.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 48).
<HI>ATITHI (guest). In ancient Bha1rata Atithi-satka1ra
<>(hospitality to a guest) was considered as a yajn5a. In
<>Manusmr2ti, Chapter 100, Verse 3, it is said that even if
<>one lives on the scattered grains in the fields after har-
<>vest, and even if penance is offered in the midst of
<>Pan5ca1gni (five fires) unless the Brahmin who comes
<>as a guest is fed, all virtuous deeds would be useless.
<>Besides, Manu has made the following remarks about

<NI>“A new visitor at night must be treated as an Atithi.
<>An Atithi is one who comes occasionally, not daily.
<>But one who lives in your village and goes about as a
<>vagabond for a living, does not deserve to be treated as
<>an Atithi. The guest who comes either before or after
<>mealtime should not be sent away without being fed.
<>Even a Vais4ya or S4u1dra who comes as a guest to a
<>Brahmin's house has to be given food when the servants
<>are given food.”
<HI>ATITHIGVA. He was a King referred to in the R2g-
<>veda. He had another name, “Divoda1sa”. This King
<>had fought several battles against Asuras with the help
<>of Indra. It is said that once, being afraid of the Asuras,
<>he tried to hide himself under the water. (R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 10, Su1kta 53; R2gveda, Man2d2ala

<HI>ATRI I.
<NI>1) {%The son of Brahma1.%} Atri Mahars2i was one of the
<>ma1nasaputras of Brahma1. The ma1nasaputras were:
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Verse 10).
<NI>2) {%One of the Saptars2is.%} Brahma's sons, Mari1ci, An3giras,
<>Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasis2t2ha are known
<>as the Saptars2is (seven sages). (M.B., S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 208).
<NI>3) {%Creator of the pracetases.%} The sage Pra1ci1nabarhis was
<>born in the family of Atri Mahars2i. Ten Pracetases
<>(Praja1patis) were born as the sons of this Muni. (M.B.,
<>S4akti Parva, Chapter 208).
<NI>4) {%Citra S4ikhan2d2i1.%} Among the seven Munis known as
<>Citra S4ikhan2d2i1s, we see Atri Mahars2i as one of the
<>As2t2aprakr2tis which form the basis of the Universe.
<NI>5) {%Important events.%} (1) {%How Maha1vis2n2u became Atri's son.%}
<>Kas4yapa had a son named Kas4ipu. He was a very mighty
<>ruler and carried on his reign in an ungodly manner.
<>In a terrible battle which took place at that time between
<>the Devas and Asuras Kas4ipu was killed. Prahla1da be- [Page074-b+ 65]
<>came the Asura King. Then there was a battle between
<>Indra and Prahla1da. After six years' war, Prahla1da with-
<>drew, defeated. Later Maha1bali, the son of Virocana
<>(grandson of Prahla1da) became emperor of Asuras. War
<>broke out again between Maha1bali and Indra. In this
<>war, Maha1vis2n2u helped Indra. The Asuras were utterly
<>defeated. They sought refuge with S4ukra, the Asura guru.
<>S4ukra promised to help them. He set out to the Hima1-
<>layas to receive a powerful mantra from S4iva. The
<>Asuras kept waiting for S4ukra's return.
<NI>At this stage, Maha1vis2n2u who was the protector of Indra,
<>came to S4ukra's a1s4rama and killed S4ukra's mother,
<>Ka1vyama1ta1. Seeing this impudence of Maha1vis2n2u, Bhr2gu
<>Mahars2i was enraged and cursed him that he should be
<>born many times in human wombs. It is on account of
<>this that Maha1vis2n2u had to take many avata1ras (incar-
<>nations). It was in this way that Maha1vis2n2u incarnated
<>as Datta1treya, the son of Atri. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th
<>Skandha).
<NI>(2) {%Atri and Para1s4ara.%} It was a time when Vasis2t2ha and
<>Vis4va1mitra were in a state of mutual ill-will. Once King
<>Kalma1s2apa1da was going about in the forest on a hunting
<>expedition. He met S4akti, the eldest son of Vasis2t2ha in
<>the forest. The King did not respect him properly. S4akti
<>transformed Kalma1s2apa1da into a Ra1ks2asa by his curse.
<>The Ra1ks2asa who was also a cannibal, first swallowed
<>S4akti himself. Vis4va1mitra offered whatever help he
<>could, to destroy Vasis2t2ha's family. Kalma1s2apa1da ate
<>successively all the 100 sons of Vasis2t2ha. Vasis2t2ha, in great
<>sorrow and Sakti's wife, Adr2s4yanti1 lived in an a1s4rama.
<>Adr2s4yanti1 was pregnant at the time of S4akti's death.
<>In due course she gave birth to a boy who was called
<>Para1s4ara and who later on became the father of Vya1sa.
<>when Para1s4ara grew up, he came to know that his father
<>S4akti was eaten by the Ra1ks2asa. Enraged at this, he
<>started a yajn5a to annihilate the whole race of Ra1ks2asas.
<>As the yajn5a gained intensity and force Atri Muni arrived
<>there with certain other Mahars2is and dissuaded Para1-
<>s4ara from the yajn5a. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 181).
<NI>(3) {%Atri's dispute with Vainya.%} Atri Mahars2i and his
<>wife once got ready to go for Vanava1sa. At that time the
<>poor Mahars2i's wife was in great distress because they
<>had no money to be distributed to their disciples and
<>children. She requested her husband to go to King
<>Vainya and to beg for some money. Accordingly the
<>Mahars2i visited King Vainya at his ya1gas4a1la1 (The shed
<>where a ya1ga is held). He began to flatter Vainya by say-
<>ing that he was the first among kings and so on. Vainya
<>did not like it. He began to dispute with Atri. Vainya
<>remarked that Indra was the first King. To settle the
<>dispute they went together to Sanatkuma1ra Muni.
<>Sanatkuma1ra sent them away reconciled. After that
<>Vainya gave Atri much wealth. After distributing all this
<>wealth among their sons and disciples Atri and his wife
<>set out to the forest to perform penance.
<NI>(4) {%How Atri became Sun and Moon.%} Once there was
<>a fierce battle between Devas and Asuras. Owing to the
<>shower of arrows from the Asuras, the Sun and Moon
<>became dim. Darkness spread everywhere. The Devas
<>began to grope in the dark. They requested Atri Maha-
<>rs2i to find a remedy for this. Moved by their distress,
<>Atri suddenly transformed himself into the Sun and
<>Moon. The Moon gave light to the Devas. The Sun
<>burnt up the Asuras by his intense heat. Thus the
<>Devas were saved. This story was told by Va1yu Bhaga- [Page075-a+ 65]
<>vana, to Arjuna. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 156).
<NI>(5) {%Atri and King Vr2s2a1darbhi.%} In the Maha1bha1rata we
<>find a story about a difference of opinion between
<>King Vr2s2a1darbhi and some Mahars2is. This story was
<>told by Bhi1s2ma to Yudhis2t2hira about the kind of per-
<>sons from whom Brahmins may accept gifts. Once the
<>Munis, Kas4yapa, Atri, Vasis2t2ha, Bharadva1ja, Gautama,
<>Vis4va1mitra, Jamadagni, and Pas4usakha1, with Arun-
<>dhati1 and Gan2d2a1, who were the wives of two Munis,
<>travelled round the world. Their object was to go to
<>Brahmaloka. At that time there was drought in the
<>world. King Vr2s2a1darbhi, the son of S4ibi, suggested that
<>the above-mentioned Munis should be called and given
<>wealth. They refused to accept it. Vr2s2a1darbhi became
<>angry. He performed Homa in A1havani1ya1gni and from
<>the agnikun2d2a, the Ra1ks2asi1 Ya1tudha1ni1 (Kr2tya1) arose.
<>Vr2s2a1darbhi sent Ya1tudha1ni1 to destroy Atri and all
<>other Munis. As Ya1tudha1ni1 was guarding a lotus pond
<>in the forest, the munis led by Atri happened to come
<>that way. The Mahars2is were able to recognize
<>Ya1tudha1ni1. They beat her with their tridan2d2u (Trident
<>or a kind of magic wand) and reduced her to ashes.
<>After satisfying their hunger by eating the lotus flowers
<>the Mahars2is went to Brahmaloka. (M.B., Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 93).
<NI>(6) {%Atri and S4ra1ddha.%} There is a passage in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata in which Atri gives advice to the emperor Nimi
<>who belonged to Atri's family. The story of how S4ra1ddha
<>originated in the world which Bhi1s2ma had told Dharma-
<>putra was retold by Atri. A son named Datta1treya
<>was born to Atri, the son of Brahma1. Datta1treya be-
<>came King. Nimi was his son. Nimi's son died after
<>one thousand years. Nimi who was in deep grief at the
<>death of his son, ordained a S4ra1ddha in memory of his
<>son. On that occasion Atri Mahars2i came there and
<>explained to Nimi the importance of S4ra1ddha. (M.B.,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 91, Verses 20-44)
<NI>(7) {%How Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara (S4iva) were born
<>as sons of Atri.%} There is no other woman in the Pura1n2as
<>who surpasses S4i1la1vati1 in her fidelity to her husband. In
<>order to enable Ugras4ravas, her husband, to satisfy his
<>passion, she once carried him on her own shoulders to
<>a prostitute's house. On the way, Ma1n2d2avya Muni
<>pronounced a curse that Ugras4ravas should die before
<>sunrise. The grief-stricken S4i1la1vati1 pronounced a
<>counter-curse that the sun should not rise on the next
<>day. As the sun failed to rise, the Trimu1rtis (Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva), accompanied by Anasu1ya1, Atri's wife,
<>went to S4i1la1vati1. Anasu1ya1 persuaded S4i1la1vati1 to with-
<>draw her curse. The Trimu1rtis who were happy at the
<>success of their mission (of bringing about the Sunrise)
<>asked Anasu1ya1 to demand any boon she wanted. Ana-
<>su1ya1 expressed her wish that the Trimu1rtis (Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva) should be born as her sons and they
<>agreed.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u, under the name of Datta1treya, was born
<>as the son of Anasu1ya1. S4iva was born to her under the
<>name of Durva1sas. There is a story about it in the Brah-
<>ma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Once S4iva got angry with the Devas.
<>They began to flee for life. But Brahma1 alone did not
<>run away. S4iva who became more furious at this,
<>pinched off one of the heads of Brahma1. Still he was
<>not pacified. Pa1rvati1 who was alarmed, approached S4iva
<>and begged him to suppress his anger. At her request,
<>S4iva's fury was transferred and deposited in Anasu1ya1, [Page075-b+ 64]
<>Atri's wife. Durva1sas is the embodiment of that element
<>of S4iva's fury.
<NI>According to the promise, Brahma1 also took his birth
<>as the moon from Anasu1ya1, the wife of Atri. (For that
<>story, see PURU1RAVAS). There is a story about that
<>also in the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Once when Brahma1
<>was performing the task of creation, he experienced
<>carnal passsion. Sarasvati1 was the offspring of that
<>passion. When Brahma1 saw her, he fell in love with her
<>also. This made him feel angry towards Ka1madeva. He
<>pronounced a curse that Ka1madeva should be burnt up
<>in the fire from S4iva's eye. (This is why Ka1madeva was
<>later burnt to death by S4iva). Although Ka1ma had
<>retreated from Brahma1 his passion had not been sup-
<>pressed. Brahma1 transferred his passion to Atri Mahars2i.
<>The Mahars2i gave it to Anasu1ya1, his wife. Since she
<>was unable to bear such a violent passion, she gave it
<>back to her husband. That passion emerged from Atri's
<>eye in the form of the Moon. This is why lovers experi-
<>ence strong passion for each other at the time of the
<>rising of the moon. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapters
<>39-43).
<NI>(8) {%Atri and Gan3ga1 Devi1.%} Once, while Atri Mahars2i
<>was performing penance in Ka1mada forest, there was
<>a terrible drought in the country. At that time, his wife
<>Anasu1ya1 made a S4ivalin3ga of sand and offered worship
<>to it. Then Atri asked her to give him a little water.
<>There was no water anywhere. Suddenly Gan3ga1 Devi1
<>appeared there and said to Anasu1ya1: “There will be
<>a hole here. Water will come out of it in a torrent.”
<NI>Pure water began to flow from the place pointed out
<>by Gan3ga1 Devi1. Anasu1ya1 begged Gan3ga1 Devi1 to stay
<>there for a month. Gan3ga1 Devi1 agreed to do so on con-
<>dition that Anasu1ya1 would transfer her Tapas4s4akti to
<>her for one month.
<NI>Atri was pleased by drinking the water. He asked Ana-
<>su1ya1 where she got such nice fresh water. She explain-
<>ed to him all matters. Atri expressed his desire to see
<>Gan3ga1 Devi1. She appeared before him at once. Ana-
<>su1ya1 prayed to her that Gan3ga1 should continue to exist
<>in the world always. Gan3ga1 Devi1 answered that she
<>would do so if Anasu1ya1 was prepared to give her the
<>fruit of one year's Tapas4s4akti and of devoted service to
<>her husband. Anasu1ya1 agreed to that condition. Sud-
<>denly S4iva appeared there in the shape of a Lin3ga. At
<>the request of Atri and Anasu1ya1 S4iva took his seat
<>there permanently assuming the name of “Atri1s4vara”.

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u, Brahma1,
<>Bhr2gu, Cyavana, Aurva.
<NI>Cyavana Mahars2i married A1rus2i1, daughter of Manu.
<>Aurva was her child who was the grandfather of Jamad-
<>agni and the great grandfather of Paras4ura1ma.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} The Preceptors of the Bhr2gu dynasty were the
<>hereditary gurus of the Kings of Hehaya. Kr2tavi1rya a
<>famous King of the Hehaya dynasty and father of Ka1r-
<>tavi1rya1rjuna had his education from a Bhr2gu r2s2i living
<>in his a1s4rama. On competing his education the king
<>paid lavishly and the Bhr2gus became rich thereafter.
<>Kr2tavi1rya died and his sons did not very much like the
<>Bha1rgavas (Bhr2gus) becoming rich by the wealth of
<>their ancestors. Knowing this the Bhr2gus started bury-
<>ing their wealth under the earth. Once a Ks2atriya [Page076-b+ 65]
<>king forcibly dug out from the house of a Bhr2gu the
<>wealth he had safely buried and from that day onwards
<>the Ks2atriyas and the Bha1rgavas became enemies. The
<>Bhr2gus were hunted down by the Ks2atriya kings and the
<>Bha1rgavas frightened by this move left their abode and
<>went and hid in Caves in mountains far away. Among
<>those who thus fled was A1rus2i1, wife of Cyavana. A1rus2i1
<>was pregnant at that time and she hid her ‘Garbha’ in
<>her thighs while fleeing. A brahmin woman who saw
<>this went and informed the Ks2atriyas and they imme-
<>diately went and caught hold of her. Then the thigh
<>broke and a boy came out of it. Because he was born
<>from the thighs the boy was named Aurva. (U1ru1=
<>Thigh and so, born of a thigh). (Chapter 179, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%The effulgence of Aurva.%} Aurva was born with fiery
<>radiance and the sudden effulgence made the Ks2atriya
<>Kings blind. Frightened they craved for pardon and
<>praised him. They got back their eyesight then.
<NI>4) {%Aurva and Bad2ava1gni.%} Aurva bore a deep grudge
<>against the Ks2atriyas who had massacred his fore-
<>fathers. Aurva started doing rigorous penance and by
<>the force of his austerities the world started to burn. At
<>that stage the Pitr2s appeared before him and persuaded
<>him to withdraw from his penance. Aurva then told
<>them thus: “Pitr2s, while I was lying in the thigh-womb
<>of my mother I heard hideous groans from outside and
<>they were of our mothers when they saw the heads of
<>our fathers being cut off by the swords of the Ks2atriyas.
<>Even from the womb itself I nurtured a fierce hatred
<>towards the Ks2atriyas. No helping hand was raised
<>before the pitiable wails of our mothers”.
<NI>The Pitr2s were astounded at the firmness of the vow of
<>Aurva and horrified at the thought of what would
<>happen if the penance was continued. They pleaded
<>again to cease his austerities and then submitting to
<>their request Aurva withdrew the fire of his penance
<>and forced it down into the sea. It is now believed
<>that this fire taking the shape of a horse-head is still
<>living underneath the sea vomiting heat at all times.
<>This fire is called Bad2ava1gni. More about this can be
<>had under the head Bad2ava1gni. (Chapter 180, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Aurva and the birth of Sagara.%} Ayodhya1 was once
<>ruled by a celebrated King of Iks2va1ku dynasty named
<>Suba1hu. He had as his wife Ya1davi1 a good natured and
<>well behaved woman who was a gem among queens.
<>One day Ta1lajam3gha a King of the Hehaya line of
<>rulers who was then the King of Ma1his2mati1 defeated
<>Suba1hu in a battle. Ya1davi1 was then pregnant. Jealous
<>co-wives poisoned her; Ya1davi1 did not die but the
<>poison affected the child in the womb.
<NI>After the defeat, Suba1hu and Ya1davi1 went and stayed
<>with Aurva in his a1s4rama. For seven years they lived
<>there and then Suba1hu died. Grief-stricken Ya1davi1 was
<>about to jump into the funeral pyre and end her life
<>when Aurva stopped her from the act pointing out that
<>she was soon to deliver a child. After a few months she
<>delivered a son and Aurva called him ‘Sagara’ meaning
<>one with ‘gara’ (poison) in him. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 16, 17).
<NI>6) {%Aurva and the sister of Garud2a.%} Garud2a, son of
<>Vinata1, had a sister named Sumati. Upamanyu, a sage,
<>wanted to marry her but neither she nor her relatives
<>liked it. Enraged at this the sage cursed Sumati saying [Page077-a+ 65]
<>that the brahmin who married her would have his head
<>burst. The marriage of Sumati thus remained a prob-
<>lem for her parents. There was a friend of Vinata1, a
<>sannya1sini1, living in a forest and to find a way to escape
<>from the curse Vinata1 sent Garud2a to her. The sannya1-
<>sini1 advised Garud2a to approach Aurva to find a solution
<>for the problem and Aurva was therefore approached
<>for advice.
<NI>It was at this time that the people of Ayodhya1 came in
<>search of Suba1hu and Ya1davi1 who had left them years
<>before. When they knew of Suba1hu's death they were
<>plunged in sorrow but were glad to know a son of
<>Suba1hu, Sagara, had grown up to be a successor to
<>Suba1hu. When Garud2a made Aurva acquainted with
<>the pitiable tale of his sister Aurva decreed that Sumati
<>should marry a Ks2atriya instead of a brahmin and thus
<>tide over the curse. He then asked Sagara to marry
<>Sumati and blessed them saying that Sagara would one
<>day become an emperor and perform an As4vamedha
<>ya1ga. Aurva then sent Sagara along with the people
<>to Ayodhya1 where Sagara after defeating all his enemies
<>became the emperor of Bha1ratavars2a. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 18-21).
<NI>7) {%Sagara's sons and how Aurva helped in getting them.%}
<>Sagara ruled the land for three thousand years. He had
<>besides Sumati another wife, Kes4ini1. Both of them bore
<>no sons for Sagara. Dejected he entrusted the adminis-
<>tration of the state with his ministers and left for the
<>a1s4rama of Aurva. Aurva blessed them and prophesied
<>that Kes4ini1 would deliver a son to continue the dynasty
<>and that Sumati would deliver sixty thousand sons of
<>no great use at all. Sagara and his wives, returned to
<>the palace and very soon both his wives became preg-
<>nant. In due time Kes4ini1 delivered a son who was
<>named Asaman5jas. But Sumati gave birth to a lump of
<>flesh. Greatly pained the King was about to throw it
<>away when Aurva appeared there and stopped him from
<>doing that. He directed him to cut the piece of flesh
<>into sixty thousand pieces and put one piece each in a
<>jar of ghee. Every year one prince would be born from
<>one of them. Thus Sumati got sixty thousand sons.
<>(Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 92).
<NI>8) {%Teaching of Aurva.%} In the evening of his life Sagara
<>went and stayed in the a1s4rama of Aurva. Aurva gave
<>him instructions on many a divine subject. He taught
<>him about the importance of the four a1s4ramas, the
<>rituals to be practised by the different castes of Bra1h-
<>man2a, Ks2atriya, Vais4ya and S4u1dra and many such
<>other things. Finally Aurva gave Sagara Brahmajn5a1na.
<>(Chapter 8, Am3s4am 3, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).

<>Bhr2gu, Khya1ti, wife of Bhr2gu, Cyavana, son of Bhr2gu
<>and Aurva, son of Cyavana. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,

<HI>AURVA II. A brahmin living in the country of Ma1lava.
<>This brahmin got a daughter named S4ami1ka by his wife
<>Sumedha. She was married very early to Manda1ra, son

<>to Aurva to bring his wife home. Aurva sent them both
<>to the house of Manda1ra with his blessings. On their
<>way home they met the Mahars2i Bhus4un2d2i and burst
<>into laughter at his sight. The sage cursed them and [Page077-b+ 65]
<>made them into two trees. When Aurva found his
<>daughter and son-in-law missing he started a search for
<>them. Then he came to know that both of them had
<>changed into trees by a curse. Aurva and his wife then
<>prayed to God for help. Aurva then lived in the tree
<>of S4ama1 in the shape of Agni and S4aunaka made an
<>idol of Gan2apati with the root of the Manda1ra tree and
<>worshipped him. Gan2apati was pleased by the devotional

<>story behind the place getting this name.
<NI>At the forest of Dan2d2aka S4ri1 Ra1ma killed many demons.
<>The force of the arrows took the skulls of the demons
<>to far off places in the forest. One of the skulls thus
<>sent far fell on the feet of a sage named Mahodara
<>who was then going that way. The skull went deep
<>into his foot and not only did it wound his foot
<>but it stuck to his foot so hard that it could not
<>be drawn out also. With his foot in pains the sage
<>visited all the holy places but with no relief to his pain.
<>At last Mahodara came to Aus4anasa and to his surprise
<>the skull came off from his foot healing his wound. He
<>remained there for some time and obtained many divine
<>attainments. From then onwards the place was called
<>‘Kapa1lamocana’. After this incident Brahma1, Vis4va1mitra,
<>Balabhadrara1ma and many such divine persons visited

<>Budha was born to Candra, Puru1ravas to Budha, A1yus
<>to Pura1ravas, Nahus2a to A1yus, Yaya1ti to Nahus2a and
<>Yadu to Yaya1ti. Yadu had five sons, the eldest of whom

<HI>AVATA1RA. (Incarnation). The incarnations of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u:--
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God takes three kinds of incar-
<>nations such as avata1ra, a1ves4a and am3s4a. That which
<>has full power is avata1ra; that which has power only
<>for the time being is a1ves4a and partial incarnation in
<>am3s4a1vata1ra.
<F>*) See Am3s4a1vata1ra.</F> The incarnations of Vis2n2u are count-
<>less. Hermits, Manus, Devas (gods) and sons of Manus
<>are incarnations in part (am3s4a1vata1ras) of Vis2n2u. Com-
<>plete avata1ras are ten in numbers of which Balabhadra
<>Ra1ma is not considered as an avata1ra by some. In-
<>stead of him they place Buddha.
<NI>{%b) Reason for the incarnations.%} Maha1vis2n2u has taken so
<>many incarnations in the world. In the S4ri1 Maha1devi1
<>Bha1gavata a story occurs to the effect that Maha1vis2n2u
<>was forced to take so large a number of incarnations
<>due to the curse of the great hermit Bhr2gu. The story
<>is as follows: Kas4yapa had a son named Kas4ipu. He
<>was daring and brave and ruled the country as an
<>enemy of the Gods. There arose a severe battle between
<>the gods and the Asuras. Kas4ipu was killed in that
<>battle. After Kas4ipu his son Prahla1da became King.
<>He too was an enemy of the Gods. So there was a
<>battle between Indra and Prahla1da. The battle conti-
<>nued for a hundred years. At last Prahla1da was defeat-
<>ed. He felt very sorry at the defeat. So he anointed
<>Bali, son of Virocana, as King and leaving the Kingdom
<>he went to the Gandhama1dana and began to do
<>penance. The fight continued between Bali and Indra.
<NI>In this fight Maha1vis2n2u helped Indra. The Asuras were
<>completely destroyed. The defeated Asuras went to
<>their teacher S4ukra who promised to protect them by
<>spells and incantations and herbs. The Gods knew
<>that S4ukra had undertaken to protect the asuras.
<NI>Leaving the asuras behind, S4ukra went to Kaila1sa to
<>get more power of spells and incantations from S4iva.
<>Before going to Kaila1sa S4ukra had asked the Asuras
<>to wait for him with faith. After this the Asuras sent
<>Prahla1da to the Gods for a truce. Prahla1da, though an
<>Asura was in good favour with the Gods. He reached
<>the court of Indra and said, “Gods, we have no desire
<>at all for war. We have decided to spend the remain-
<>ing period in penance wearing barks of trees and tufts
<>of hair. How wicked a deed is battle and how delight-
<>ful it is to become a devotee of God! So hereafter you
<>will not be troubled by us. Likewise I hope you will
<>not do us innocent people any harm.”
<NI>The gods believed Prahla1da. The Asuras, in the guise
<>of hermits waited for S4ukra in the hermitage of Kas4-
<>yapa. S4ukra reached Kaila1sa and bowed before S4iva and
<>requested that he might be given the power of defeat-
<>ing the Gods by some means quite unknown to Br2has-
<>pati the teacher of the devas (Gods). S4iva was in [Page079-a+ 65]
<>trouble. He could refuse neither S4ukra nor the Gods.
<>At last he told hermit S4ukra that to come by such a
<>spell he had to stand head downwards, inhaling smoke
<>for a thousand years. S4iva said so thinking that when
<>the dreadful nature of the feat was considered, S4ukra
<>might desist from the attempt. But S4ukra began that
<>penance instantly.
<NI>The Gods understood everything. The deceit of the
<>Asuras, the crookedness of S4ukra all were now clear to
<>them. They trembled with fear and began to consult
<>how to get over the difficult situation. Finally they
<>decided to go to war with the Asuras. The gods did
<>accordingly. The Asuras were in trouble. They were
<>not strong enough to face the Gods. So they all went
<>to Ka1vyama1ta1, the mother of S4ukra. The devas (gods)
<>with Maha1vis2n2u at their head chased the Asuras. Ka1vya-
<>ma1ta1, by the merits of her devotional meditation
<>petrified Maha1vis2n2u and Indra. Maha1vis2n2u thought of
<>his Sudars4ana (wheel-weapon of Vis2n2u) which instant-
<>ly made its appearance and cut off the head of Ka1vya-
<>ma1ta1. The great hermit Bhr2gu got angry because Maha1-
<>vis2n2u committed woman-slaughter, and cursed him thus:
<>“You are a crooked being, a viper, a deceit. The
<>hermits who adore you as the seat of all that is good
<>are mere fools; you are wicked, of a black character,
<>and I curse you to take countless incarnations in the
<>world, and painful confinement by and by because of
<>your sins.” (S4ri1 Maha1devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).
<NI>Thus having cursed Vis2n2u, the hermit Bhr2gu took some
<>water from his water-pot and sprinkled it on the face of
<>Ka1vyama1ta1, who woke up as if from sleep. (For the
<>remaining portion of the story see S4ukra).
<NI>2) {%Das4a1vata1ras. (The ten Incarnations).%} Owing to the curse
<>of Bhr2gu, mentioned above, Maha1vis2n2u had to under-
<>take so many incarnations, complete as well as partial.
<>Complete incarnations are ten in number. They are
<>called Das4a1vata1ras (The Ten Incarnations).

<NI>1) {%Matsya1vata1ra. (Fish Incarnation).%} To Kas4yapa, the
<>son of Mari1ci, and the grandson of Brahma1 a son
<>was born, by his wife Aditi. He was called Vivasva1n
<>and the Manu who was the son of Vivasva1n is known
<>as Vaivasvata Manu or Satyavrata Manu. It was dur-
<>ing the time of this Manu that Vis2n2u incarnated as a
<>Matsya (fish).
<NI>Once, while Brahma1 was reciting the Vedas (the Scrip-
<>tures) Hayagri1va, an asura, stole the Vedas from the
<>side of Brahma1 and with them he went under water to
<>the bottom of the ocean and hid himself there. So
<>Maha1vis2n2u decided to take the form of a fish to recover
<>the stolen Vedas.
<NI>Vaivasvata Manu, the first and foremost of the godfear-
<>ing, was once doing penance in a place known as Badari1.
<>He got down into the river Kr2tama1la1 to take a bath.
<>Then a small fish said to the Manu: “Oh King, I am
<>afraid of large fishes. So please don't forsake me”. Hear- [Page079-b+ 65]
<>ing this the Kind Manu took the fish in his hand and
<>put it in an earthenware pot and brought it up. In a
<>few days the fish began to grow. When the pot became
<>insufficient the King put it in a larger pot. When that
<>also became too small, the King put the fish in a pond.
<>When the pond could not hold the fish any longer the
<>King put it in the Ganges at its request. After a few days
<>the Ganges also became too small for the fish. Finally
<>the fish told the King: “Oh, King, within seven days
<>there will be a great flood in the world. You should
<>make a boat and take the seven hermit-sages with you
<>in the boat and escape. I will help you.”
<NI>Hearing this he got an immensely large boat ready and
<>obeyed the instructions of the fish. Within seven days
<>rain started in torrents. Everything in the world, the
<>moving and the not moving, were under the flood. A
<>horn began to sprout from the head of the fish. Manu
<>tied his boat on that horn. The fish reached the summit
<>of the Hima1layas with the boat, which was tied to the
<>highest peak. Since the peak came to be called ‘Nau-
<>bandhana S4r2n3ga’ (The peak to which boat is tied).
<>The rain ceased to pour. It was seen that everything
<>in the world had been destroyed except the Manu and
<>the seven hermit-sages and some of the germs, saved
<>in the boat. (This story occurs in the great Hindi work
<>‘Ka1ma1yani1’ of Jayas4an3kar Prasa1d). (M.B., Aran2ya
<>Parva, Chapter 187; Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 2; Bha1gavata
<>8th Skandha, Chapter 24).
<NI>This story of the incarnation of Vis2n2u as fish is seen in
<>the Bible figuratively. “In the order of the generations
<>of Adam, the first creation of God, S4eth, Enos; Kaina1n,
<>Mahali1l, Ja1red, Enoch, Methu1selah, Lamech and Noah
<>were born. When Noah was five hundred years old he
<>begot Shem, Ham and Japheth.
<NI>There was a great flood during the time of Noah. God
<>said to him: “The end of all flesh is come before one;
<>for the earth is filled with violence through them, and
<>behold, I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee
<>an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the
<>ark and shalt paint it within and without with pitch.
<>And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of. The
<>length of the ark should be three hundred cubits, the
<>breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty
<>cubits. A window shalt thou make to the ark and in a
<>cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the ark
<>shalt thou set in the side thereof, with lower, second and
<>third stories shalt thou make it. And behold, I, even I,
<>do bring a flood of water up on the earth. to destroy all
<>flesh wherein is the breadth of life from under heaven
<>and everything that is in the earth shall die. But with
<>thee will I establish my covenant, and thou shalt come
<>into the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy
<>sons' wives with thee, and of every living thing of all
<>flesh, two of every sort, shalt thou bring into the ark to
<>keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and fe-
<>male. Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after
<>their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth
<>after their kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee
<>to keep them alive. And take thou unto thee of all food
<>that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee, and it
<>shall be for food for thee and for them.” Thus did Noah
<>according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
<NI>And the Lord said unto Noah, “Come thou and all thy
<>house into the ark, for thee Have I seen righteous be-
<>fore me in this generation. Of every clean beast thou [Page080-a+ 65]
<>shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female
<>and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and
<>his female. Of fowls also of the air by sevens the male
<>and the female to keep seed alive up on the face of all
<>the earth. For yet seven days and I will cause it to rain
<>up on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every
<>living substance that I have made will I destroy from
<>off the earth.” And Noah did according unto all that
<>the Lord commanded him.
<NI>And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of
<>waters was up on the earth. And Noah went in, and
<>his sons and his wife and his sons' wives with him into
<>the ark because of the waters of the flood. Of clean
<>beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and
<>of everything that creepeth upon the earth. There went
<>in two and two unto Noah into the ark the male and
<>the female as God had commanded Noah. And it came
<>to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were
<>upon the earth. In the six hundredth year of Noah's
<>life in the second month on the seventeenth day of the
<>month the same day were all the fountains of the
<>great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were
<>opened and the rain was up on the earth for forty
<>days and forty nights. In the self-same day entered
<>Noah and Shem, and Ham and japheth the sons of
<>Noah and Noah's wife and the wives of the sons
<>with them into the ark. They and every beast after
<>his kind and all the cattle after their kind and
<>every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth
<>and every fowl after his earth after his kind, every
<>bird of every sort. And they went in unto Noah
<>into the ark, two and two of all flesh wherein is the
<>breadth of life. And they that went in, went in male
<>and female of all flesh as God had commanded him
<>and the Lord shut him in. And the flood was forty days
<>upon the earth, and the waters increased and bore up
<>the ark and it was lifted up above the earth. And the
<>waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the
<>earth and the ark went up on the face of the waters.
<>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth
<>and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven
<>were covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters
<>prevail and the mountains were covered. And all the
<>flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and
<>of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that
<>creepeth up on the earth, and every man. All in whose
<>nostrils was the breadth of life, of all that was in the
<>dry land, died. And every living substance was des-
<>troyed which was up on the face of the ground both
<>man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl
<>of the heaven, and they were destroyed from the earth.
<>And Noah only remained alive, and they that were
<>with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed upon
<>the earth for hundred and fifty days.
<NI>And God remembered Noah and every living thing
<>and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and
<>God made a wind to pass over the earth and the
<>waters became calm. The fountains also of the deep
<>and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain
<>from heaven was restrained. And the waters returned
<>from off the earth continually and after the end of the
<>hundred and fifty days, the waters were abated. And the
<>ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day
<>of the month upon the mountains of Ara1rat. And the
<>waters decreased continually until the tenth month. [Page080-b+ 65]
<>In the tenth month on the first day of the month
<>were the tops of the mountains seen. And it came to
<>pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the
<>window of the ark which he had made. And he sent
<>forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters
<>were dried up from off the earth. Also he sent forth
<>a dove from him to see if the waters were abated
<>from off the face of the ground. But the dove found
<>no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned
<>unto him into the ark for the waters were on
<>the face of the whole earth. Then Noah put forth
<>his hand and took her and pulled her to the ark. And
<>he stayed yet other seven days. And again he sent
<>forth the dove out of the ark. And the dove came
<>in to him in the evening, and lo, in her mouth
<>was an olive leaf plucked off. So Noah knew that
<>the waters were abated from off the earth. And he
<>stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove,
<>which returned not again unto him anymore. And it
<>came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the
<>first month, the first day of the month the waters were
<>dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the
<>covering of the ark and looked and beheld the face of
<>the ground was dry. And in the second month on the
<>seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth
<>dried. And God spake unto Noah saying: “Go forth of
<>the ark, thou and thy wife, and thy sons and thy sons'
<>wives with thee. Bring forth with thee every living thing
<>that is with thee, of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and
<>of every creeping thing that creepeth up on the earth,
<>that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be
<>fruitful and multiply up on the earth. And Noah went
<>forth and his sons and his wife and his sons' wives
<>with him. Every beast, every creeping thing and every
<>fowl and whatsoever creep up on the earth after their
<>kinds went forth out of the ark. And Noah built an
<>altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and
<>of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the
<>altar. And the Lord smelt a sweet savour and the Lord
<>said in his heart: “I will not again curse the ground
<>anymore for man's sake. For the imagination of man's
<>heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again smite
<>anymore every thing as I have done. While the earth
<>remaineth seed time and harvest and cold and heat
<>and summer and winter and day and night shall not
<>cease. (Holy Bible, Genesis, Chapters 6, 7 and 8).

<>when Durva1sas visited the realm of Gods he presented
<>Devendra with a garland made of flowers of exquisite
<>fragrance. Indra tied it on to the tusk of Aira1vata (the
<>elephant of Indra). When the beetles which gathered
<>on the garland for honey became a nuisance, Aira1-
<>vata destroyed that garland. Durva1sas who got angry
<>at this cursed the gods as a whole that they would get
<>wrinkles and grey hair. The gods were advised by
<>Maha1vis2n2u that if they got Ambrosia (Amr2ta--celestial
<>honey) from the sea of Milk by churning it they could
<>escape from this. Accordingly the Gods called the
<>asuras for help, and they approached the sea of Milk.
<>They made use of the Mountain of Mandara as churn-
<>drill and the huge snake Va1suki as churning rope, and
<>the churning commenced. The gods took hold of the
<>tail of the snake and as the churning was proceeding
<>the churn-drill, the mountain of Mandara, having no
<>fixation at the bottom sank down. Then Maha1vis2n2u [Page081-a+ 65]
<>took the form of a turtle, and got under the Mandara
<>mountain and lifted it up on his back. By the force of
<>lifting it went higher and higher up. Then Maha1vis2n2u took
<>the form of an eagle and sat on the top of the mountain
<>and it came down a little and placed itself in the right
<>position. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 7; Agni

<>that period when hermit Kas4yapa was carrying on
<>his evening prayer and devotional rites, his wife Diti
<>approached him with lustful desire. Kas4yapa told her
<>that as he was engaged in prayer and meditation it
<>was not proper on her part to select that particular
<>moment for her lustful desire. But she persisted and
<>the sage yielded and out of that union two sons were
<>born. They are the two asuras Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu. Of these Hiran2ya1ks2a was the incarnation of
<>Jaya and Hiran2yakas4ipu that of Vijaya.
<F>*) During their next birth they made their appearance as Ra1vnca and Kumbhakarn2a and during the third birth they were S4is4upa1la and
<>Dan2d2avaktra.</F> With the
<>birth of these two the whole world began to tremble.
<>These two asura brothers began to terrorize the world.
<>They wandered about causing destruction and devasta-
<>tion wherever they went. Once Hiran2ya1ks2a got down
<>into the ocean and began to beat the waves in the
<>ocean with his cudgel. The ocean began to sway and
<>surge. Varun2a (the Lord of water) was terrified and
<>he ran to Maha1vis2n2u and sought protection. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u took the form of a Pig and came to the ocean.
<>When Hiran2ya1ks2a saw Maha1vis2n2u he took the earth in
<>his hand and ran to Pa1ta1la (the nether world). Maha1-
<>vis2n2u followed him and killed him and recovered the
<>earth. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 3, Chapter 18; Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 2, Chapter 7 and Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 4).
<NI>4) {%Narasim3ha1vata1ra. (Incarnation as lion-man).%} With the
<>death of Hiran2ya1ks2a, his brother Hiran2yakas4ipu became
<>furious more than ever. He wanted to avenge the death
<>of his brother. His fury was turned towards Maha1vis2n2u.
<>So he got on the top of the Mountain of Mandara and
<>did penance before Brahma1 and Brahma1 appeared and
<>granted him boons, one of which was that nobody but
<>Vis2n2u should be able to kill him. He returned with
<>gladness and began to roam about torturing devotees
<>of Vis2n2u everywhere.
<NI>A son named Prahla1da was born to him. He was a god-
<>fearing child and from birth an ardent believer in Vis2n2u.
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu tried his utmost to change his son to a
<>hater of Vis2n2u. He got a special teacher for the
<>purpose and Prahla1da was taken to the house of the
<>teacher to live with him until he changed his mind. The
<>result was that the teacher and all others who advised
<>him ultimately became believers in Vis2n2u. Anger over-
<>powered Hiran2yakas4ipu. Prahla1da was thrown before
<>mad elephants. But the tusks of the elephant missed the
<>aim and were driven into the earth and broken. Veno-
<>mous snakes were employed and those which bit him had
<>their fangs broken. Finally the child was put in blazing [Page081-b+ 63]
<>fire. But the child felt the fire to be cool and soothing.
<>From that fire a ghost arose and tried to kill Prahla1da.
<>Instantly the Sudars4ana, the wheel-weapon of Vis2n2u
<>came down and cut off the head of the ghost. Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu jumped with anger and called out. “Where
<>is your Vis2n2u?” His son replied that his Vis2n2u dwelt
<>in every movable and immovable thing. Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>kicked at a stone pillar close by and asked him, “Is
<>your Vis2n2u in this pillar?” Prahla1da replied, “My Vis2n2u
<>is in Pillar and in fibre”. Before he had finished, the
<>Pillar broke open and a monster as horrible as the
<>Destroyer S4iva, in the shape of a lion-man made its
<>appearance.

<NI>This was the figure of Narasim3ha. Mr. S. Paramesvara
<>Iyer, Ulloor, has described this figure in his “Bhakti-

<NI>“Glaring eyes burning as blazing cinder, tongue as a

<>human shape beyond the neck.” (Bhaktidi1pika1)
<NI>The horrid monster caught hold of Hiran2yakas4ipu the
<>King of the Asuras, pushed him to the ground and
<>opened his heart with its fierce claws. Blood sprouted
<>like a spring. With great ferocity he pulled out the in-

<>songs of praise and chanting of hymns of adoration
<>pacified the stormy Narasim3ha and bowed low down

<NI>5) {%Va1mana1vata1ra. (Incarnation as a Dwarf).%} It was to ex-
<>pel the Emperor Maha1bali, that Maha1vis2n2u incarnat-
<>ed as a dwarf. To Kas4yapa, the son of Mari1ci and
<>the grandson of Brahma1, was born of Diti, Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu. And from Prahla1da the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>was born Virocana and Bali was the son of Virocana.
<>Bali got the name Maha1bali because of his prowess.
<>He was the emperor of the Asuras. A fierce battle
<>began over the Ambrosia got from churning the sea
<>of Milk, between the Asuras and the gods. In the battle
<>Indra cut Maha1bali down with his Vajra1yudha. The
<>Asuras took the body of Maha1bali to Pa1ta1la (the
<>nether world) where their teacher S4ukra brought him to
<>life again. Then Maha1bali worshipped the Bha1rgavas
<>and became more powerful than before and went to
<>heaven again and renewed the battle. This time he
<>defeated the Gods altogether and subjugated the realm
<>of the Gods who were scattered to all sides. The devas
<>or gods are the sons of Kas4yapa born by his wife, Aditi.
<>She felt very sorry at the defeat of the gods. Seeing that
<>she was silent and sad Kas4yapa asked her the reason.
<>She replied that she was thinking of ways to enable the
<>gods to recover their lost power and position. Kas4yapa
<>advised her to please Maha1vis2n2u by observing Dva1-
<>das4i1 vrata (fast of the twelfth lunar night). Aditi did
<>so and Vis2n2u appeared before her and asked her what
<>she desired. Her request was that Vis2n2u should take
<>birth in her womb and recover Indra to his lost power
<>and position. Thus Vis2n2u took birth as the younger
<>brother of Indra in the shape of Va1mana (dwarf.)
<NI>At this time Emperor Maha1bali was celebrating a sacri-
<>fice on the bank of the River Narmada1 after having
<>subjugated the whole of the world. A large number of
<>hermits gathered there. Va1mana also was among them.
<>He requested Maha1bali to grant him three feet of
<>ground as alms. The teacher S4ukra warned Maha1bali
<>against granting the request. But the emperor granted
<>the request and asked Va1mana to measure the ground.
<>Va1mana immediately enlarged his body and measured
<>the heaven, the earth and the Pa1ta1la (the upper realm,
<>the earth and the lower realm) in two steps and asked
<>for place for the third step. The honest Maha1bali
<>showed his head and requested to complete the three
<>steps. Va1mana put his step on the head of Maha1bali and
<>pushed him down to Pa1ta1la. Thus the gods regained
<>their lost places. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8, Chapter 19).
<>A description that by the toe of Va1manas' raised foot
<>(raised for measuring the third step) the testicle of
<>Brahma1 was cut open where from the Ganges originated,
<>is seen in the Bha1gavata, Skandha 5.
<NI>When Vis4va1mitra took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a to the
<>forest they entered a holy hermitage and Vis4va1mitra
<>told the boys that it was the hermitage where Aditi,

<>place that Va1mana incarnated and placed his step on
<>the head of Maha1bali.
<NI>“The bright Ma1dhava took birth in Aditi as Va1mana
<>and went to Maha1bali, requested for three feet of ground
<>and brought under control the three worlds for the good

<>Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna pleased the hermit-sage Datta1treya [Page082-b+ 63]
<>the son of Atri, by doing penance and got the boon of
<>one thousand hands. One day he went to the forest for
<>hunting and entered the bank of Narmada1. The hermit
<>Jamadagni had been living there with his wife Ren2uka1
<>and sons Paras4ura1ma and others. The King being tired
<>of hunting got into the hermitage. Paras4ura1ma was not
<>there. The hermit called his divine cow Ka1madhenu,
<>which provided the King and his followers with a very
<>good supper.
<NI>When the King departed he asked for the wonderful
<>cow. The hermit did not consent. The King caught
<>hold of the cow by force and went to his city. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma went to Ma1his2mati1nagar the capital of Ka1rtta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna, killed the King and took Ka1madhenu back.
<>From that day onwards the sons of Ka1rttavi1rya were
<>waiting for an opportunity to take revenge.
<NI>Once Ren2uka1 went to the river to bring water. A gan-
<>dharva (semi god) named Citraratha was bathing in
<>the river. She happened to look at him for a little while.
<>When she returned the hermit was very angry and asked
<>each of his sons to cut off the head of their mother. They
<>all refused. But Paras4ura1ma immediately obeyed his
<>father and cut off her head. His father was pleased and
<>said that he might ask any boon. He requested his father
<>to bring his mother back to life. Accordingly Ren2uka1
<>was brought back to life.
<NI>Once the sons of Ka1rttavi1rya got into the hermitage,
<>at a time when Paras4ura1ma was away and cut off the
<>head of the hermit Jamadagni and took it off. When he
<>returned his mother told him how his father was killed.
<>She cried and beat her breast twentyone times. Paras4u-
<>ra1ma became an incarnation of revenge, and travelled
<>over the world twentyone times and killed every Ks2at-
<>riya King. The blood of all those Kings flowed into one
<>channel and gathered in a holy Bath called Syamanta-
<>pan5cakam3. Thus Maha1vis2n2u took his sixth incarna-
<>tion as Paras4ura1ma and fulfilled his duty of destroying
<>the wicked Ks2atriya Kings (For details about Paras4u-
<>ra1ma see under Paras4ura1ma and Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna).

<>only will be acceptable. People would become irrespon-
<>sible wearing the garment of duty. Lawless people
<>would take the form of Kings and will begin to eat

<>the son of Vis2n2uyas4as and the priest of Ya1jn5avalkya and

<>brought back to the four classes and the four a1s4ramas
<>or stages of life and the doctrines and directions of the

<>took the form of Su1kara (Pig). To show the world the
<>tattva (essence) of Sat (good) and tama (darkness)
<>He took the form of hermit Na1rada. To show the merits
<>of penance He became Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. To impart
<>to the world the meaning of Sa1m3khya Yoga (Indian
<>Philosophy dealing with evolution and union with the
<>Supreme Spirit) He came as Kapila the learned. To
<>teach the world the laws of chastisement He was
<>born as Datta of the wife of Atri. Then He came as
<>Yajn5a to become Indra. The next incarnation He took
<>was R2s2abha, the noble King. To shorten and flatten
<>the earth He came as Pr2thu. To recover the Vedas he
<>took the form of Matsya (fish). To remove wrinkles and
<>grey hair the gods had churned the sea of Milk and
<>then to lift the mount Mandara He went under it and
<>as a bird He got up on it. To give the world A1yurveda
<>(the scripture of medicine) He came as Dhanvantari.
<>To entice Asuras and to recover Ambrosia from them
<>He took the form of Mohini1. To save the devoted
<>Prahla1da and to slay his father He came in the form of

<>hell meant for those who stand false witness, who take
<>false oath and false name. The soldiers of Yama will
<>push these false people into the hell of Avi1ci, from the
<>top of a mount which is a hundred yojanas (league) high.
<>The place of Avi1ci, like the waves of the ocean, is swell-

<HI>AVIJN5A1TAGATI. Two sons were born to Anila, a vasu
<>by his wife S4iva1. They were called Avijn5a1tagati and
<>Manojava. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 25).
<HI>AVIKAMPANA. This ancient King got from the her-
<>mit Jyes2t2ha Sa1tvatadharma (righteousness). (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 384, Stanza 47).
<HI>AVIKS2IT I. A famous King. The son of Karandhama
<>and father of Marutta. He was honoured even by
<>Br2haspati, having performed a hundred horse sacrifices.
<>Mention is made in the Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a that Aviks2it
<>had seven wives: Vara1, Gauri1, Subhadra1, Li1la1vati1,
<>Vibha1, Man3gavati1, and Kumudvati1. Besides them Vai-
<>s4a1lini1 the princess of Vis4a1la1 also was his wife. He had
<>taken this Vais4a1lini1 from her Svayam3vara dais (the
<>bride herself selecting a husband from those who are
<>present), defeating the Kings who were present
<>there. Those defeated Kings, later, joined together and
<>defeated Aviks2it and took him a prisoner. Finally Kara-
<>ndhama rescued him. His greatness is described as
<>follows:
<NI>“The righteous man Aviks2it is equal to Indra in pro-
<>wess. This austere and righteous man has become a
<>great sacrificer. In brightness he is equal to the
<>Sun, as forgiving as the earth, in intelligence equal
<>to Br2haspati and as firm as the Hima1layas. By his
<>thought, word, and deed and self control and noble
<>actions he kept his subjects in peace and prosperity.”
<>(Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 4, Stanzas
<>19-21).

<>wife Va1hini1. Aviks2it was one of them. [See the word
<>Vam3s4a1vali1 (Genealogy)].
<HI>AVIMUKTA(M). The middle part of the city of Ka1s4i1.
<>There is a holy temple here. It is said that those who

<>to Ra1ma.
<NI>“The aged giant and noble leader Avindhya, who had
<>earned the confidence of Ra1van2a, brave, learned and of

<>words.”
<NI>(S4ri1 Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 37,

<>“The famous giant leader, the noble aged well-wisher
<>of Ra1ma, Avindhya, had told me about you.”
<NI>“(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Stanza 56). There is a situa-
<>tion in Vana Parva when this noble giant prevented
<>Ra1van2a from his attempt to kill Si1ta1.
<NI>“When he saw the decision of Ra1van2a to kill Si1ta1,
<>Avandhya pacified Ra1van2a” and said, “you, a great King
<>of a great kingdom should not deteriorate to the level
<>of killing a woman. A woman who is in prison and at
<>your disposal is as good as dead. But in my opinion, even
<>if you cut her body into pieces she would not die and
<>if she must die you will have to kill her husband.”
<>(M.B., Aran2ya Parva, Chapter 289, Stanzas 28 to 30).
<NI>From this statement the wonderful intelligence of
<>Avindhya could be understood. It is seen in stanzas 6
<>and 7 of Chapter 291 of M.B., Vana Parva that it was
<>Avindhya who had taken Si1ta1 before S4ri1 Ra1ma when

<HI>AYODHADHAUMYA (A1yodhadhaumya). A1poda-
<>dhaumya, Apodadhaumya, Dhaumya. A great Muni
<>(sage). He had three disciples, A1run2i, Upamanyu and
<>Veda.
<NI>1) {%Disciple A1run2i.%} He belonged to Pa1n5ca1la, and once his
<>guru deputed him to construct embankments in the
<>field. But, his attempts to construct embankments
<>did not succeed. Finally he lay himself in the field
<>where the embankment was required, and then the
<>flow of water stopped. The guru enquired about A1run2i,
<>who was thus lying in the field. Then only he knew
<>the reason for A1run2i's absence. The guru went to the
<>field and called A1run2i. Then the embankment burst [Page084-b+ 65]
<>open and A1run2i came out, and because of that A1run2i
<>got the name Udda1laka. (M.B., Chapter 3, Verses
<>21-33).
<NI>2) {%Disciple Upamanyu.%} Once Dhaumya (the guru) asked
<>his second disciple Upamanyu to tend the cows. He
<>used to take care of the animals grazing in the woods

<>body of Upamanyu the guru asked him how he was
<>feeding himself. His reply was that he was begging
<>alms and feeding himself with what he got thus. Then
<>the guru asked him to hand over to him (guru) all
<>alms got in future. After that he used to give everything
<>he got by way of alms to the guru. And, he continued
<>returning to the Gurukula at dusk and prostrating be-
<>fore the guru. Finding Upamanyu even then as plump
<>and healthy as he was formerly, the guru said: My
<>son Upamanyu, you hand over to me all the alms you
<>get, and yet your body looks as trim as of old. How
<>happens it so?” Upamanyu replied: “After giving the
<>alms I get first to you, my guru, I do again beg for
<>alms and feed myself”. To this the guru reacted thus:
<>My boy, what you do is not the proper thing. By the
<>second course of alms-taking you stand in the way of
<>other people getting their food. It is gross injustice to
<>do so.”
<NI>Upamanyu, from that day onwards strictly followed
<>his guru's instruction, and continued returning at dusk
<>to the guru and doing obeisance to him.
<NI>Even then finding Upamanyu to be quite plump and
<>healthy the guru told him: “Well, now you hand over
<>to me all the alms you get, and you do not take alms
<>a second time the same day. Yet you are quite fit and
<>fat. How is it so?”
<NI>To this Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding him-
<>self on the milk of the cows he tended. The guru told
<>him that this too was not just and proper on his part.
<>The guru had not permitted him to drink milk thus.
<NI>Upamanyu agreed to obey his orders. And, as usual he
<>continued tending the cows and returning at dusk. Even
<>then he maintained the same plump and healthy phy-
<>sique. And the Guru told him as follows: “You do not
<>eat the food you get at the first alms-taking, you do not
<>go in for alms a second time the same day, nor do you
<>drink milk. Yet, how is it that you maintain the same
<>fat and healthy physique as in former days?”
<NI>Upamanyu's reply was that he was feeding now-a-days
<>on the foam of milk bristling at the mouth of the
<>calves when they had fed on their mother's milk. And,
<>the guru said: “if that is so the calves will be, out of
<>kindness and sympathy for you, releasing much foam
<>of milk out of their mouths. That will affect them. So,
<>do not repeat the process. Since the guru forbade him
<>to have food in any manner as detailed above, Upa-
<>manyu, while tending the herd of cows in the forest, ate
<>the bitter and poisonous leaves of a tree one day to
<>satisfy his burning hunger. The leaf was bitter in taste
<>and injurious in its properties. Therefore, this new way
<>of satisfying hunger affected the health of the eyes of
<>Upamanyu and he became blind. Moving about in this
<>condition he fell into a neglected well in the woods.
<NI>When, even after the sun had set, Upamanyu did not,
<>as usual, return, the guru enquired about him from
<>other disciples. Naturally, they told the guru that
<>Upamanyu was out in the forest with the cows. As the [Page085-a+ 65]
<>guru felt that Upamanyu was staying away late in the
<>forest since he had been prevented from doing every-
<>thing he (guru) went to the forest accompanied by
<>other disciples and called out for Upamanyu, and
<>Upamanyu responded from deep down the well. He
<>also told the guru how he happened to fall into the well.
<>After telling him that if only he would pray to the
<>As4vini1devas they will cure his blindness the guru return-
<>ed to the A1s4rama with other disciples. Upamanyu,
<>accordingly offered praises and prayed to the As4vini1-
<>devas, who were so pleased with him that they appeared
<>before him and gave him a bread. Upamanyu refused
<>to eat the bread without giving it to the guru. Then
<>the As4vini1devas told him thus: “In the past when we
<>gave your guru a bread like this he ate the same with-
<>out giving it to his guru. You may just imitate him
<>and eat the bread yourself”. Even then Upamanyu did
<>not eat the bread. The As4vini1devas were so much
<>pleased at this that they blessed Upamanyu thus: “The
<>teeth of your guru will turn into hard iron and yours
<>into pure gold. Your blindness will be cured and all
<>happiness and prosperity will be yours.”
<NI>The blessings of the As4vini1devas took full effect, and
<>Upamanyu hurried to his guru and prostrated at his
<>feet. Dhaumya and the other disciples of his congratu-
<>lated Upamanyu. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 3, Verses
<>34-77).
<NI>3) {%Disciple, Veda.%} Ayodhadhaumya one day said to
<>Veda, his third disciple: “You stay with me for some-
<>time serving me. That will bring you all prosperity in
<>life.” Veda agreed, and stayed for a long time in the
<>A1s4rama in the service of the guru. Without even the
<>slightest murmur he put up with every discomfort and
<>hardship, be it acute hunger and thirst or extreme
<>cold or heat, and gladly performed all the work and
<>duties the master imposed on him. The guru was ab-
<>solutely pleased and his blessings resulted in all pros-
<>perity and omnipotence for the disciple. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 3, Verses 78-80).
<HI>AYODHYA1. A city in North India which enjoyed great
<>importance and reputation for many years as the capi-
<>tal of the Kings of the solar dynasty. (See Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty). All the Kings of this dynasty ruled the coun-
<>try from this city as their capital. Vasis2t2ha, the great
<>preceptor of the Iks2va1ku Ra1jas, came to Ayodhya1 dur-
<>ing the period of the reign of Kalma1s2apa1da, who was
<>the thirtyfifth ruler in succession to Iks2va1ku. A quarrel
<>broke out between Kalma1s2apa1da and Vasis2t2ha during
<>a hunting expedition, and Vasis2t2ha cursed the King
<>and as the result the latter became a Ra1ks2asa. After
<>regaining his former form as King, he apologised to
<>Vasis2t2ha and they became friends again. At the requ-
<>est of the King in the interests of his dynasty Vasis2t2ha
<>came to Ayodhya1, and the people were greatly elated.
<>A son was born to Vasis2t2ha by Kalma1s2apa1da's wife and
<>that son was As4maka. After that Vasis2t2ha used to go to
<>Ayodhya1 frequently and was installed as family precep-
<>tor of the Iks2va1kus. Till the time of S4ri1 Ra1ma the city
<>of Ayodhya1 maintained its pomp and glory, and after
<>that gradually its decay and fall set in. Laudatory refe-
<>rences to the city are found in most of the Pura1n2as
<>like the Maha1bha1rata, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a etc. (See
<>Kosala).
<HI>AYOMUKHI1. A Ra1ks2asa woman. She met S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a on their way to Matam3ga1s4rama in [Page085-b+ 65]
<>search of Si1ta1, and requested Laks2man2a to marry her.
<>Laks2man2a, as in the case of S4u1rpan2akha1 cut off her
<>nose and breasts and drove her away. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 69).
<HI>AYUTANA1YI. A king of the Pu1ru Vam3s4a; he was the
<>son of Maha1ra1ja Bhauma. Suyajn5a1, Ka1ma1 and Akro-
<>dha were the names respectively of his mother, wife
<>and son. He came to be known as Ayutana1yi because
<>of his having performed 10,000 Purus2amedhas. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verses 19-20)
<HI>AYUTA1YU. A king who ruled his state for 1000 years.
<>The Pura1n2as like Bha1gavata, the Matsya and the Va1yu
<>refer to him as the son of S4rutas4ravas.
<HI>AYUTA1YUS. Father of King R2tuparn2a. (Bha1gavata,
<>Navama Skandha). For genealogy see Iks2va1ku dynasty.
<HI>A1. ({#A#}) This word means Brahma1 and also ana1dara-
<>va1kya (a word showing disrespect). In the indeclinable
<>form it means limit, anger and pain.
<HI>A1BHI1RAS.
<NI>{%A few details:%} 1) A low-caste people. People living in
<>the estuary of the rivers of Sindhu1 and Sarasvati1 were
<>generally called A1bhi1ras. In the Sabha1 Parva of Maha1-
<>bha1rata we find Nakula defeating these people during
<>his victory march after the great Maha1bha1rata battle.
<NI>2) Once A1bhi1ras went to Dharmaputra with many
<>gifts. (S4lokas 11-13, Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) Once it was prophesied by Ma1rkan2d2eya R2s2i, that
<>low-caste people like A1bhi1ras and S4akas would become
<>rulers of states in different parts of Bha1rata during
<>Kaliyuga. (S4lokas 35-36, Chapter 188, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>4) In the Garud2avyu1ha (Battle array named after
<>Garud2a) which Dron2a created during the Kuruks2etra
<>battle he included A1bhi1ras also. (S4loka 6, Chapter 20,
<>Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) Because of the hatred of S4u1dras and A1bhi1ras a sac-
<>red lake named Vina1s4ana disappeared from the river,
<>Sarasvati1. (S4lokas 1 and 2, Chapter 37, S4alya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>6) A1bhi1ras were Ks2atriyas formerly. Afraid of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma they fled and lived in mountain-caves not conti-
<>nuing their hereditary work and thus became S4u1dras.
<>(S4loka 16, Chapter 29, As4vamedhika Parva, M.B.).
<NI>7) When Dva1raka1 was destroyed by floods and all the
<>Ya1davas were killed Arjuna went north taking along with
<>him the wives of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. At that time A1bhi1ras were
<>among those who attacked and carried away the
<>women. (S4lokas 47-63, Chapter 7, Mausalya Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>A1CAMANA. First drink water three times accompanied
<>by incantations and then with water wipe your face
<>twice and your eyes, ears, nose, shoulders, breast and
<>head once. This act is called A1camana.

<>Kha1ni caiva spr2s4edabhir
<>A1tma1nam3 s4ira eva ca”</Poem>
<>(Manusmr2ti, S4loka 60, Chapter 2).
<NI>Devi1 Bha1gavata in its eleventh Skandha says about
<>A1camana like this: “Drinking water by your right hand
<>is called a1camana. Curve your palm into the shape of
<>a spoon, hold water in it and drink. There must be
<>enough water in the palm to cover a green-gram seed,
<>not less nor more. If it falls short or exceeds the mea-
<>sure it is considered to be like drinking alcohol. While [Page086-a+ 65]
<>shaping your palm neither your little finger nor your
<>thumb should touch the other fingers. At the time of
<>a1camana you should support your right hand by your
<>left hand. Otherwise the water will turn impure.”
<HI>A1CA1RAMARYA1DAS. See under Pu1ja1vidhi.
<HI>A1D2AMBARA. One of the five Pa1rs2adas whom Brahma1
<>gave to Skandadeva. Brahma1 gave Kunda, Kusuma,

<HI>A1D2I. A mighty son of the demon, Andhaka1sura. He did
<>penance to please Brahma1 and obtained from him a
<>boon to seek vengeance on S4iva who had murdered his
<>father. The boon was that A1d2i would die only when he
<>left his present form and took another form. After
<>obtaining the boon A1d2i went to Kaila1sa and outwitting
<>the sentries entered the abode of S4iva in the shape of a
<>serpent. After that he disguised himself as Pa1rvati1 and
<>went near S4iva. But S4iva knew the trick and killed him.
<>(Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a of Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1D2I1BAKA. A combat without serving any useful pur-
<>pose and conducted out of sheer spite between two
<>people to the surprise of others. The fight between
<>Vasis2t2ha and Vis4va1mitra was of this king. (Skandha 6
<>of Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1DIGADA1DHARA. It was with the bones of an asura
<>(demon) named Gada that Maha1vis2n2u made the first
<>gada1 (mace). By that mace Vis2n2u killed Heti and other
<>asuras of that lot and got the name A1digada1dhara (He
<>who first handled the mace). (See under Gada1).
<HI>A1DIKU1RMA. The mountain of Mandara which was
<>used as a churn-stick to churn the great milky ocean,
<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi went down the ocean. Then Maha1vis2n2u
<>took the shape of a tortoise to lift it up and this first
<>tortoise was called A1diku1rma. (S4loka 12, Chapter 18,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1DIPARVA. One of the parvans of the epic Maha1bha1rata.
<>It is the first parva. (See under Bha1rata).
<HI>A1DIPARVATA. The place of abode of S4iva in the

<HI>A1DIRA1JA. The son of Kuru who was a king of the
<>Pu1ru dynasty. (See under Pu1ru).
<HI>A1DIS4IS4IRA. One of the disciples of S4a1kalya. Vya1sa
<>made the Vedas and taught his son S4a1kalya a portion
<>of it. S4a1kalya divided his portion into five different
<>and equal divisions and taught each of his five disciples,
<>Va1tsya1yana, Maudgalya, S4a1li, A1dis4is4ira and Gokhali a
<>division. (Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1DIS2T2I. The disciple who was ordained by his precep-
<>tor to observe celibacy for a stipulated number of years.
<HI>A1DITYA. The twelve sons born to the sage Kas4yapa of
<>his wife Aditi are known as the twelve A1dityas. They
<>are the following: Dha1ta1, Mitra, Aryama1, Rudra,
<>Varun2a, Su1rya, Bhaga, Vivasva1n, Pu1s2a1, Savita1, Tvas2t2a1
<>and Vis2n2u. Besides these Aditi had twentyone children
<>including Indra. All of them are called A1dityas mean-
<>ing children of Aditi. From the thirtythree sons of Aditi
<>were born the thirtythree crores of devata1s. Of these
<>the eldest is Indra and the youngest, Va1mana. (S4loka
<>36, Chapter 66, A1di Parva, M.B.). (There is corrobora-
<>tion for this in S4loka 14, Sarga 14, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>Sirdar K.M. Panikar in his preface to the book “R2gveda-
<>sam3hita1” writes thus about A1dityas: “Generally we
<>think of Su1rya (the Sun) when we hear the word
<>A1ditya. But there are many different A1dityas in R2g-
<>veda, chief of them is Varun2a. Though Savita1, Pu1s2a1 [Page086-b+ 64]
<>and Mitra are all synonyms of Su1rya in R2gveda they
<>are all separate devas. There is no end to the varieties
<>of A1dityas and their prominence in the Vedas. Sum-
<>marising we can say thus. The familiar devas like
<>Indra, Agni, Varun2a and Su1rya are not found in the
<>same form or power as we are taught to believe. Those
<>whom we have lowered down to the posts of the eight
<>sentries of the universe are very prominent devata1s in
<>the Vedas. Many A1dityas have merged in Su1rya and
<>winds in the god of Va1yu. Rudra has merged in S4iva.
<>Who will believe that the all-powerful Deva of the R2g-
<>veda and the vainglorious Indra who lives in fear of
<>men doing penance are one and the same person?”
<HI>A1DITYAHR2DAYA. A mantra (incantation) of great
<>power to destroy all enemies. During the combat with
<>Ra1van2a at one time Ra1ma fell exhausted in the battle-
<>field. Seeing this the sage Agastya rushed to him and
<>taught him this mantra. (Sarga 107, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>A1DITYAKETU. One of the sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Bhi1ma

<>ter 88, Bhi1s2ma Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1DITYASENA. A very brave King. Stories about this

<HI>A1GNEYA1STRA. A powerful weapon or missile. One
<>night Arjuna fought against a gandharva, An3ga1raparn2a,
<>on the banks of the river Ganges. Arjuna then described
<>to him how he came into possession of this missile. This
<>powerful missile was given first to Bha1radva1ja by Br2has-
<>pati and Bharadva1ja gave it to Agnives4ya who in turn
<>gave it to Dron2a and the latter gave it to Arjuna, his
<>most favourite disciple. (S4lokas 29-30, Chapter 170, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1GNEYI1. Wife of Kuru, son of Manu. S4ambhu wife of
<>Dhruva gave birth to two sons, S4is2t2i and Bhavya.
<>Succha1ya1 wife of S4is2t2i1 gave birth to five sinless sons
<>Ripu, Ripum3jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2katejas. Ca1k-
<>s2us2a was born of Br2hati1, wife of Ripu. Manu was born
<>to Ca1ks2us2a of his wife Pus2karin2i1, daughter of the great
<>Vi1ran2apraja1pati. Pus2karin2i1 hailed from the dynasty of
<>Marutta. To Manu were born of Nad2vala1 ten sons,
<>Kuru, Puru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci,
<>Agnis2t2oma, Atira1tra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. Of
<>these, Kuru got of his wife A1gneyi1 six sons: An3ga,

<>that A1huka and Ugrasena were the names of the same
<>person). For genealogy, see “YADU VAM3S4A”. In M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 33, we find that

<>times. I will eat meat and any kind of food. I will lie on
<>soft bed or on bare earth sometimes and in big houses
<>if I get the chance. I will wear costly clothes if I get
<>them or I will wear dried leaves and animal skins. If
<>I get food from ya1gas4a1la1s I will never refuse it, but I
<>will never go seeking for it.” (S4lokas 19-25, Chapter
<>179, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).

<>Elephants were born as the sons of Ma1tan3gi1. (Sarga 14,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.).
<NI>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata to explain why the
<>tongue of the elephant is curved inside. “Bhr2gu Mahars2i
<>cursed Agni and greatly dejected over this he dis-
<>appeared from public and hid somewhere. The Devas
<>started searching for him and it was an elephant that
<>showed the devas the hiding place of Agni. Agni then
<>cursed the elephants and said that thereafter all the
<>elephants would have their tongues curved inside. (S4loka
<>36, Chapter 85, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.).
<NI>The signs of good elephants and the treatment to be
<>accorded to sick ones are detailed in Agni Pura1n2a.
<>“Elephants with long trunks and heavy breathing be-
<>long to the top class and they will possess great endu-
<>rance power. Those who have nails eighteen or twenty
<>in number and who became turbulent during winter
<>belong to a superior class. Those ones whose right
<>tusks are a bit raised, whose cry is stentorian as that of
<>thunder whose ears are very big and whose skins are
<>spotted are the best of the species. Other varieties espe-
<>cially the dwarfish type and she-elephants in the early
<>stage of pregnancy are not good and not fit to be tamed.
<>Elephants who have Varn2a, Sattva, Bala, Ru1pa, Ka1nti,
<>S4ari1ragun2a and Vega will conquer enemies in a battle;
<>there is no doubt about it. Elephants are an ornament [Page088-a+ 38]
<>for any battle-array. The victory earned by a King with
<>his elephants is more respected.
<NI>For all diseases of an elephant Anuva1sana or Sneha-
<>vasti is recommended. A bath after anointing it with
<>oil or ghee is good. For skin diseases the ghee may be
<>combined with Man5jal (Turmeric), Maraman5jal or
<>gomu1tra (cow urine). If it suffers from enlargement
<>of the belly, giving it a bath with sesame oil is good.
<>It can be given Pan5calavan2as and Va1run2i1madya to
<>drink. If there is fainting it must be given rice mixed
<>with Vlalari, Triphala, Cukku, Mulaku and Tippali
<>and water mixed with honey to drink. If there is head-
<>ache anointing the head with sesame oil and inhala-
<>tion of the same is good.
<NI>For diseases of the foot, treatment with Snehaput2as is
<>prescribed. To get motion of the bowels Kalkan2t2a
<>Kas2a1ya (infusion of sugar candy) is good. To those who
<>have shivers should be given the flesh of peacock,
<>Tittiri bird and La1va bird mixed with Tippali and pep-
<>per. For dysentery the tender fruit of Ku1vala, skin of
<>Pa1ccotti, flower of Ta1tiri should be dried and powder-
<>ed and be given mixed with sugar along with rice. For
<>Karagraha (pain inside the trunk) Nasyam of ghee with
<>I1ntappu1 mixed in it should be done. It must be given
<>“Muttan3ga Kan5ci with tippali, Cukku and Ji1raka in
<>it. For Utkarn2aka (pain in the ear) flesh of pigs should
<>be given. For Galagraha (pain in the neck) a liniment
<>made of Das4amu1la, Mutirappuli and Ka1kkappancci in
<>oil should be rubbed at the site of pain and the elephant
<>kept under chains. If there is difficulty in passing urine
<>light liquor containing powdered As2t2alavan2as should
<>be given. For all skin diseases use Vep oil as an oint-
<>ment and give the infusion of A1t2alot2aka to drink. For
<>worms (inside the stomach) give cow's urine with pow-
<>dered Vla1lari in it. If the elephant is getting reduced
<>and weak it should be given milk or meat soup with Cuk-
<>ku, Tippali and grapes well mixed in it. If there is lack
<>of appetite it is to be given Mulgaudana (rice boiled [Page088-b+ 79]
<>along with Cerupayar) to which is added Cukku, Mulaku
<>and Tippali. If it is Gulma it should be given sesame
<>oil boiled with the following: Trikotpakkonna, Cukku,
<>Mulaku Tippali, Kotuvelikkilan3gu, Na1gadantiveru,
<>Erikkinveru, Na1tkkotpakkonna, Milk and Attittippali.
<>Navara rice with sort of cerupayar can also be given.
<>For swellings on the face, a paste made of tender
<>Ku1vala fruits can be rubbed at the site of the swelling.
<>For all sorts of pains in the stomach rice well mixed
<>with the powder made by grinding together Vla1lari,
<>Kut2akappa1layari, Asafoetida, Carala, Man5jal, Mara-
<>man5jal may be given.
<NI>The best food for elephants is the rice of Navara, Vri1hi
<>and cennellu. Yava and wheat are next to the above.
<>Any other food is inferior to these. Yava and sugarcane
<>will give strength to elephants. Dry yava rice is not
<>good. Milk and meat cooked with carminative ingre-
<>dients are good for elephants who have gone lean.
<NI>If the elephants receive great injuries in a battle the
<>meat of birds like crow, fowl, cuckoo and Hari mixed
<>with honey is good. Fumigation by the burning of
<>chilli, fish, Vla1lari, caustic soda, Puttal, Pi1ram and
<>maraman5jal mixed together is effective. Dropping
<>honey medicated with tippali tandula, sesame oil, and
<>fruit honey in the eyes is not only good for the eyes but
<>is also inducive of digestion. Make an ointment with
<>the faces of the birds ca1taka and Pa1ra1vata mixed with
<>the burnt skin of Na1tpa1mara dissolved in light spirit.
<>If this ointment is applied, the elephant would defeat
<>all enemies in a battle. Powder Ni1lotpala, Muttan3ga
<>and Takara and make an ointment using rice gruel.
<>Applying this ointment in the eye is excellent.
<NI>If the nails grow they should be cut at least once a
<>month. Once in a month an oil bath is good for the
<>elephants. Elephant sheds should be spread with cow-
<>dung discs and dust. Doing Seka with ghee during
<>autumn and summer is advisable. (Chapter 287, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).

<HI>A1NAKADUNDUBHI. An epithet of Vasudeva, father
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<HI>A1NANDA. A forest on the top of the mountain Maha1-
<>meru. It was inhabited by celestial damsels, devas,
<>gandharvas and Mahars2is. (Chapter 93, Bhu1mi
<>Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1NANDA (CA1KS2US2A). Son of Mahars2i Anamitra. It
<>was he who was born as Ca1ks2us2a, the sixth Manu.
<>There is a story behind his birth. One day, while his
<>mother was keeping him in her lap and caressing him
<>the baby laughed and questioned “Oh mother why are
<>you caressing me, but look at those two cats. They
<>consider me as their food”. After some time one of the
<>cats took the child away and put it in the cradle of the
<>child of King Vikra1nta. Vikra1nta took the child as his
<>for granted and reared him. At the time of Upanayana
<>the King asked the boy to prostrate before his mother at
<>which the boy exclaimed “Oh King, I am not your son.
<>Your son is at some other place. By births and rebirths
<>all of us have many mothers and so it is better to be
<>above rebirths”. After having said so much A1nanda
<>went to the forest and started doing penance. Brahma1
<>appeared before him and blessing him said that he
<>would become the sixth Manu and lead the world to
<>righteousness. By the blessing of Brahma1 A1nanda was
<>reborn as Ca1ks2us2amanu. (See under Ca1ks2us2a). (Ma1r-
<>kan2d2eya Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1NANDAVARDHANA. A great critic of Sanskrit litera-
<>ture. He lived in the 9th century A.D. He expounded
<>his theory of Dhvaniva1da by 120 Ka1rika1s. His own
<>commentary of the Ka1rika1s is the book called Dhvanya1-
<>loka. There are four parts for Dhvanya1loka and each
<>part is called an Udyota.
<NI>There is a belief among a few that the Ka1rika1s were
<>written by another scholar, Sahr2daya, and that A1nanda-
<>vardhana had written only a commentary on it. He
<>was a member of the royal council of Avantivarma1
<>who ruled Kashmi1r during the period 854-884 A.D.
<>It is believed that he wrote Dhvanya1loka in 850 A.D.
<>Many commentaries have been written of Dhvanya1loka
<>of which the one written by Abhinavagupta is consider-
<>ed to be the best.
<HI>A1NARTTA. Grandson of Vaivasvatamanu. He was a
<>king, son of S4arya1ti.
<NI>1. {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u-Brahma1-
<>Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Vivasva1n-Vaivasvatamanu-S4arya1ti-
<>A1nartta.
<NI>Sixteen sons were born to Vaivasvatamanu: Manu,
<>Yama, Yami1, As4vini1kuma1ra, Revanta, Sudyumna, Iks2-
<>va1ku, Nr2ga, S4arya1ti, Dis2t2a, Dhr2s2t2a, Karu1s2a, Naris2yanta,

<>two children, Sukanya1 and Anartta. Sukanya1 became
<>the wife of Cyavana.
<NI>2) {%Other details.%} It was this king who built the fortresses
<>at the town of Kus4asthali1 (Dva1raka1). Varun2a submerg- [Page089-b+ 55]
<>ed in the ocean all the fortresses built by him and the
<>place for some time remained as a forest-land. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata Kilippa1ttu). It was after that that
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a made that land beautiful and called it
<>Dva1raka1. The country ruled over by A1nartta was called
<>A1narttam. During his regime there lived in his land a
<>very great scholar named Vedaratha. (Umes4a1navrata,
<>S4iva Pura1n2a) See under Vedaratha.
<HI>A1NARTTA (M). A place in ancient Bha1rata. Arjuna
<>conquered this place. (S4loka 4, Chapter 26, Sabha1
<>Parva, M.B.).

<>13 and 14, Chapter 123, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1N3GIRASAKALPA. A sam3hita1 division of Atharva-
<>veda. The five sam3hita1 divisions of Atharvaveda
<>written by Mun5jikes4a are the best. They are: The
<>Naks2atra Kalpa dealing with the pu1ja1 rites of the
<>stars; The veda Kalpa dealing with the rites associated
<>with Brahma1, the R2tvik; The Sam3hita1 Kalpa, dealing
<>with the use and practice of Mantras; The A1n3girasa
<>Kalpa dealing with sorcery; and the S4a1nti Kalpa
<>dealing with matters relating to the welfare and
<>control of animals like horses and elephants. (Chapter 6,
<>Am3s4am 3 of Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1N3GIRASI1. A very chaste wife of a Brahmin. By the
<>curse of S4akti, son of Vasis2t2ha Kalma1s2apa1da, a king of
<>the Iks2va1ku dynasty became a demon. That demon
<>killed and devoured the husband of A1n3girasi1. Enraged
<>at this the Brahmin lady cursed Kalma1s2apa1da saying
<>that if he touched his wife thereafter he would die.
<>That was why Vasis2t2ha had to beget a son for Kal-
<>ma1s2apa1da of his wife. (S4lokas 16-22, Chapter 181, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1N3GHRIKA. One of the sons of Vis4va1mitra who were
<>Brahmava1dins. (S4loka 54, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana

<>(Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>A1N5JANA KULA. A division of elephants (in the
<>army). (S4lokas 17 and 18, Chapter 112, Dron2a Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>A1NUS4A1SANIKA PARVA. One of the Parvans of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata’).
<HI>A1PA. One of the As2t2avasus. The As2t2avasus are A1pa,
<>Dhruva, Soma, Dharma, Anila, Agni, Pratyu1s2a and
<>Prabha1sa. The sons of A1pa are Vaitan2d2a, S4rama, S4a1nta
<>and S4vani. (See under As2t2avasus). (Chapter 15, Am3s4am
<>1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1PAGA1. A sacred river. It is said that if one gives food
<>to one brahmin on the banks of this river it will be
<>equivalent to giving food to a crore of brahmins else-
<>where. (S4loka 68, Chapter 83, Vana Parva, M.B.). [Page090-a+ 64]
<HI>A1PASTAMBA. An ancient sage. He once consoled
<>King Dyumatsena. (S4loka 18, Chapter 298, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<NI>1) {%How he got his name.%} Once a brahmin did not get
<>a suitable man toofficiate as priest for a s4ra1ddha cere-
<>mony. He then prayed to his ancestors, Vis4vedevas
<>and Maha1vis2n2u for help and then A1pastamba appeared
<>before him. The brahmin gave him food to his heart's
<>content and asked him how he felt. To the surprise of
<>the brahmin A1pastamba replied, he wanted some more
<>and thus made the S4ra1ddha ineffective. The brahmin
<>got angry and cursed him by sprinkling on his face
<>water taken in his palm. But before the water-particles
<>reached his face A1pastamba ordered the water-drops to
<>remain still. Water stopped stiff and still midway by
<>the power of the sage. Because water (A1pa) became
<>stiff (Stamba) the r2s2i was named A1pastamba. (Brahma
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%How A1pastamba ti1rtha came into existence.%} Once he met
<>Agastya Muni and asked him who was superior among
<>the gods Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva. Agastya declared
<>that S4iva stood supreme of the lot and gave him advice
<>as to how to please S4iva. Following his instructions
<>A1pastamba did penance on the banks of the river Gau-
<>tami1 and S4iva appeared before him, blessed him, and
<>made that place a holy one. S4iva declared that those
<>who, bathed at that place would obtain ‘Divyajn5a1na’
<>(Divine knowledge enabling one to know the past,
<>present and future). From then onwards that place
<>was known as A1pastamba ti1rtha.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} A1pastamba had a very chaste and
<>humble wife named Aks2asu1tra1. Their son was Ga1rki.
<>‘Gr2hyasu1trasam3graha’ containing a prayer and two man-
<>tras is a contribution to the holy science by A1pastamba.
<>Many Hindus follow it even now. He had stated
<>that the decrease in the number of great sages was
<>because of the fact that people were not practising the
<>control of the senses as before.
<HI>A1PADDHARMA PARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1PAVAN I. Another name of sage Vasis2t2ha. (S4loka 5,

<HI>A1PAVAN II. An ancient sage. Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna once
<>burnt the a1s4rama of this r2s2i and he cursed Agni and
<>Ka1rttavi1rya1rjuna. (S4lokas 42 and 43, Chapter 49, S4a1nti
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1PODADHAUMYA. (See Ayodadhaumya).
<HI>A1PTA. A well-known serpent of the Kas4yapa dynasty.
<>(S4loka 8, Chapter 35, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1PU1RAN2A. A well-known serpent of the Kas4yapa dy-
<>nasty. (S4loka 6, Chapter 35, A1di Parva).
<HI>A1R. The significance of the number six among the an-
<>cients, is given below. (In Malaya1lam A1r means six).
<NI>1) {%Six factors which reduce the span of life.%} Eating dry
<>meat, Drinking curd at night, Sleeping at dawn,
<>Drinking impure water, Exposure to sun's heat in the

<HI>A1RS2A(M). A form of marriage. Bra1hma is the form of
<>marriage in which the bride is given to a man of good
<>ancestry and fine character. Marriage by giving the
<>bride after receiving a pair of cows from the bride-
<>groom is called A1rs2a. Pra1ja1patya is the form of marriage
<>in which the bride is given to the man who asks for
<>her. When the bride is given with dowry, the marriage
<>is known as A1suram. Marriage with the mutual love and
<>consent is Ga1ndharva. Capturing the bride after a fight
<>and marrying her by force is Ra1ks2asa. Marriage after
<>deceiving the bride is called Pais4a1ca. These are the
<>seven types of marriage. According to the author of the
<>Smr2ti another form of marriage known as DAIVA is
<>also mentioned. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 154).
<HI>A1RS2T2IS2EN2A. A Mahars2i. In the Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 159 there is a reference to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>visiting this sage during their life in the forest. A1rs2t2i-
<>s2en2a's a1s4rama was midway between Badarya1s4rama and
<>Kubera's capital.
<NI>{%Power of Tapas.%} In Kr2tayuga this sage did rigorous
<>tapas in Pr2thu1dakati1rtha. Owing to the rigour of the
<>tapas he obtained all the chief vedas. He gave three
<>boons to that sacred ti1rtha:--
<NI>1. Those who bathe in this ti1rtha will get the benefit of
<>As4vamedha ya1ga.
<NI>2. There will be no fear of snakes in this ti1rtha.
<NI>3. A slight effort made here, will be rewarded with
<>greater results.
<NI>After giving these three boons to the river Sarasvati1
<>which is Pr2thu1dakati1rtha the sage attained Brahmin-
<>hood and entered Devaloka. (M.B., S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 40, Verses 3-9).
<HI>A1RTTA1YANI. S4alya, son of R2ta1yana. He was noted

<>against Arjuna along with S4akuni. (S4loka 122, Chap-
<>ter 156, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RUN2I V. One of the one hundred and eight Upanis2ads.
<HI>A1RUS2I1. A daughter of Manu. Cyavana Mahars2i married
<>her. They got a son named Aurva. The child was

<>Aurva. Rci1ka was the father of Jamadagni, father of
<>Paras4ura1ma. Even from childhood Aurva was a bold,
<>bright and good boy. (S4lokas 47 and 48, Chapter 66,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAS. The R2gveda gives us most of the information
<>regarding the A1ryas who came to the north of India
<>during the times of the Vedas through the passes on
<>that north-western side of Bha1rata. Sirdar K.M. Panikar
<>writing in his preface to the ‘R2gvedasam3hita1’ by Poet
<>Vallathol summarises the information available in the
<>R2gveda about A1ryan culture and says: “When the
<>A1ryans first entered India they were rich in
<>cattle. They used to breed goats, dogs, donkeys, and
<>horses. The elephant was unknown to them. In the
<>Vedas the vehicle of Ind a is a horse and not an eleph-
<>ant. When hailing Indra they shout ‘come, come on
<>your horse-back’. The Veda does not say anything
<>about how Indra got the elephant, Aira1vata, as his
<>vehicle. Sing to the glory of Indra against whom in
<>his chariot driven by two horses no enemy would dare
<>to face.
<NI>The R2gveda gives great importance to agriculture.
<>Areas under cultivation were called Urvara and
<>‘Ks2etra’. Fields were ploughed by attaching six, eight
<>and even twelve bullocks to the plough. Water was taken
<>from hr2adas and Kulyakas (ponds and tanks) for the
<>purpose of irrigation. Agriculture was a very familiar
<>art to them. They used to cultivate all sorts of grains
<>and grams including yava. They conducted trade by
<>the exchange of goods generally. There is a reference
<>in one place of the use of a coin ‘Nis2ka’
<NI>The A1ryas were clever in the art of leather work, wood-
<>work and metallurgy. They were well versed in medi-
<>cine also. In a su1kta of the ninth man2d2ala it is stated
<>that the father of a r2s2i was a medical practitioner.
<>There are references to many industries also. Weav-
<>ing was a very important industry at that time. Cotton
<>cloth and woollen blankets were made by them on a
<>large scale. Iron was used by them with great skill.
<>The manufacture of armours and the descriptions about
<>them in R2gveda are ample evidence of the proficiency
<>of the A1ryas in ironmongery and blacksmithy. Sea
<>voyage was not familiar to them. References to traders
<>cruising in boats in the Sindhu river do not give much
<>importance to the cruising. In food rice and ghee were
<>important. Meat was also relished. Rs2is wore animal
<>skins but others wore dhotis and shawls.
<NI>During the R2gvedic times their social structure was
<>divided into four stages: Gra1ma was a colony of fami-
<>lies and was the nucleus of the society. A number of
<>gramas formed into a place called Vis2aya. A number
<>of Vis2ayas became what was known as ‘Janam’. The
<>importance of Janas can be understood by the state- [Page091-b+ 65]
<>ments made about Pan5cajanas and the existence of
<>special Janas like Ya1dava Jana and Bha1rata Jana.
<NI>There is no wonder why the A1ryas who had to live among
<>enemies accepted kingship. The R2gveda narrates the
<>difficulties people would have to encounter if they were
<>left to fight their enemies without a proper leader and
<>so advocates Kingship and gives it an exalted position
<>in their social structure. Su1kta 22, Anuva1ka 12 of
<>Man2d2ala 10 describes the coronation of a King thus:
<>“I do hereby crown you as King. Come to our midst.
<>Rule us with courage and an unwavering mind. Let
<>all your subjects love you. Let thy kingdom remain
<>with you for ever”. The next mantra is also of the
<>same idea. A King is above punishment. The veda
<>speaks about many famous kings of which the following
<>are worth mentioning. Divoda1sa, Suda1s, Ambari1s2a,
<>Nahus2a and Puru1ravas.
<NI>The chief priest was always the political advisor also.
<>Vis4va1mitra and Vasis2t2ha were two great priests of the
<>Bharata dynasty. There were other priests also. Men-
<>tion is there about a Ra1jasabha1 though nothing is said
<>about their powers or functions. It can be surmised
<>that the Sabha1 was constituted of only men of character
<>and learning.
<NI>It is interesting to note the type of domestic life in
<>vogue then. A father had the right, to sell his children,
<>To cite an example is the story of S4unas4s4epha who was
<>made into a cow and sold to Vis4va1mitra who looked
<>after him well. The father had the right to make his
<>children lose all rights over his properties. Vis4va1mitra
<>sent out from his family fifty sons who refused to obey
<>him. Dowry was current then. Su1kta 11, Anuva1ka 3,
<>Man2d2alam 10 ordains that the bride should go to the
<>house of her husband after the marriage. Polygamy was
<>not objected to. There is a mantra to harass the co-wife
<>and its purpose is to make the husband more attached
<>to her who hates the co-wife. The originator of this
<>mantra was Indra1n2i1, the queen of Indra. Indra had
<>many wives. Marriage was considered as a necessary
<>duty. Widow marriage was allowed.
<NI>The R2gveda gives the picture of a society of people
<>who were always at war with each other. “We are
<>surrounded by mighty enemies. Help us”. This is the
<>slogan that rings out from the R2gveda.
<NI>The R2gveda is a history of the A1ryas. The march from
<>Kubha1tat2a (Kubul) to the banks of Yamuna1 is depict-
<>ed there. It was at Kubha1tat2a that the mantras were
<>first made. When they reach the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>the period of R2gveda ends. The crossing of each of
<>the five rivers of Pan5canada is treated as a big event
<>by the r2s2is. When they saw the huge and deep river,
<>Sindhu, they were amazed. The wonder is reflected in a
<>lovely mantra. It was after crossing Sindhu that they had
<>to oppose the ‘Dasyus’. The R2gveda itself records that
<>the Dasyus were more cultured than the A1ryas. S4am-
<>bara, a Dasyu King, was the ruler of a hundred cities.
<>Their fortresses were strong. They have been described
<>in the R2gveda as As4vamayi1, A1yasi1 and S4atabhuji1.
<NI>The chief opponents of the A1ryas were a tribe of people
<>called Pan2is. From the Nirukta of Ya1ska we are given
<>to understand that the Pan2is were mainly engaged in
<>trade. The R2gveda names many Dasyu kings of which
<>the following few were more daring and brave and the
<>A1ryas acknowledged their superior strength and courage:
<>Dhuni, Cumuri, Vipru, Varcis and S4ambara. Among [Page092-a+ 65]
<>the several divisions of the Dasyus, the S4imyus, Ki1kat2as,
<>S4igrus and Yaks2us ranked foremost in power. They are
<>described as having black colour and flat noses and
<>speaking a language different from that of the A1ryas.
<>We may surmise from these facts that they belonged
<>to the Dra1vid2a class of people. They never conducted
<>ya1ga nor did they worship gods like Indra. They were
<>idol worshippers for they have been abused as ‘S4is4na-
<>devas’. Later the A1ryas learnt from the Dasyus the
<>worship of S4iva, Devi1 and Lin3ga.
<NI>Conquering these daring and cultured enemies the
<>A1ryas reached the banks of the Yamuna1 to find to their
<>pleasant surprise a radical change in themselves. The
<>Bharatas settled themselves in the land between the
<>Yamuna1 and Gan3ga1 and remained friendly with the
<>Dasyus living to the east of Gan3ga1. The A1ryas who
<>settled down in Pan5canada were strong and to prevent
<>them from coming and conquering them Bharata tried
<>to keep them remain on the other side of S4utudri
<>(Sutlej). This led to a war called Da1s4ara1jn5a.
<NI>This war is to be considered as one of the most impor-
<>tant of wars in the world. Those who opposed Suda1s
<>were A1ryas though among the supporters of Suda1s were
<>also A1ryas. It was the people under Suda1s who came
<>out victorious in that war and put a stop to further
<>conquests by the A1ryas. From thereafter the A1ryas
<>joined hands with the aborigines and laid the foundation
<>for the great Hindu civilization. Thereafter the R2gveda
<>states about prayers for help to combat ‘our enemies
<>of A1ryas and Dasyus’. The gods who were recognised
<>later were those who were not found in the vedas of
<>the A1ryas. The worship of Maha1yogi1 and Devi1 found
<>in Mohenjodaro is an evidence of this change.
<HI>A1RYA1. One of the seven mothers who were present at
<>the birth of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 13, Chapter 228,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAKA. A famous serpent. (S4loka 7, Chapter 35,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.) A1ryaka is associated with Bhi1masena
<>in the following story. Once Duryodhana gave snake
<>poison in his food to Bhi1masena. Unaware Bhi1ma took
<>his food as usual and went to bathe in the river. After
<>some time Bhi1ma became unconscious due to the effect
<>of the poison and fell flat in the river.
<NI>Immediately Duryodhana bound him by ropes and put
<>him in more deep waters. Bhi1ma reaching the bottom
<>was bitten by all the snakes there. This fortunately
<>served as an antidote and the poison in Bhi1ma's body
<>was neutralized and Bhi1ma became his old self again
<>and killed all the serpents. Those serpents who escaped
<>went and brought their chief, Va1suki. At that time it was
<>A1ryaka who advised Va1suki to give him ‘rasapa1na’.
<>(S4lokas 64-68, Chapter 127, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYAKU. Another name for Durga1devi1. (Chapter 12,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>A1RYA1VARTA. Another name for Bha1rata. There is
<>also a place of that name. According to Smr2ti the land
<>lying between the Hima1layas and the Vindhyas is called
<>A1rya1varta. (S4loka 15, Chapter 325, S4a1nti Parva, M.B.).
<HI>A1RYA1VARTA. A king of the dynasty of Vis4vakarma1.
<>{%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u are Brahma1,
<>Dharma, Prabha1sa, Vis4vakarma1, Priyavrata, Agni1dhra,
<>Na1bhi, R2s2abha and A1rya1varta.
<NI>Of these R2s2abha got of his wife Jayanti1 twenty sons:
<>Bharata, Kus4a1varta, Ila1varta, Brahma1varta, Arya1varta
<>Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspr2k, Vidarbha, [Page092-b+ 65]
<>Ki1kat2a, Kavi, Hari, Antari1ks2a, Prabuddha, Pippala1yana,
<>A1virhotra, Dramid2a, Camasa and Karabha1jana. Of these
<>Bharata ruled over this land and gave it the name
<>Bha1rata. Brothers of Bharata ruled different parts of this
<>land. Dramid2a's land became known later as Dra1vid2a
<>(Daks2in2abha1rata).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA I. A Ks2atriya King. He was the incarnation
<>of a Ra1ks2asa called Krodhavas4a. Kas4yapa was the son
<>of Mari1ci, Brahma1's son. Kas4yapa married Krodha-
<>vas4a1, daughter of Daks2a. The Ra1ks2asa group called
<>Krodhavas4as were the children of Krodhavas4a1. Many
<>Ks2atriya kings trace their descent from this group of
<>Ra1ks2asas. The names of such Ks2atriya Kings are given
<>below: Madraka, Karn2aves2t2ha, Siddha1rtha, Ki1t2a-

<>Ci1rava1sas, Kauravya, Dantavaktra, Durjaya, Rukmi,
<>Janamejaya, A1s2a1d2ha, Va1yuvega, Bhu1ritejas, Ekalavya,
<>Sumitra, Gomukha, Va1tadha1na, and Ks2emadhu1rti.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 6, Verses 59-64).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA II. S4iva. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>17, Verse 121).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HABHU1TI. See under Pan5catantra.
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA. Name of a month. By feasting in this month,
<>one will have many sons and much wealth. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 106, Verse 26).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HA. Name of a star. After observing a fast on the
<>day of this star, if curd is given to a Brahmin of noble
<>birth, one can take rebirth in a family having many
<>cows. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 64, Verses
<>25-26).
<HI>A1S2A1D2HAKA. A mahout in the Udayana story. In
<>Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka, 5th Taran3ga, we
<>find a reference to an elephant called Bhadravati1 and a
<>mahout named A1s2a1d2haka in the palace of the heroine,
<>Va1savadatta1.
<HI>A1SAM3GA. See under ANAS4A.
<HI>A1SAM3GAPLA1YOGI. A King, who was generous by
<>nature. In the R2gveda, there is a reference to this King
<>who once lost his masculinity and was transformed into
<>a woman but was restored to manhood by a Muni
<>named Medhya1tithi.
<HI>A1SANA. Posture in Yoga1bhya1sa. There are different
<>types of a1sanas. The chief of them are given below:
<NI>1) {%Bhujan3ga1sana.%} Lying flat, face downwards on a
<>sheet with hands placed close to the body on either
<>side. After relaxing all the muscles of the body, concen-
<>trate the mind on health. Keeping the feet close to-
<>gether and pressing the knees against the ground, raise
<>the soles upwards to the sky. Place both palms, pressing
<>against the ground, touching the shoulders on both
<>sides. Then raise the head and bend the neck back-
<>wards as far as possible. At this time, the trunk and
<>legs should be in close contact with the ground. Gra-
<>dually raise the chest, supported by the hands on the
<>ground. Bring the head down in the same way as it was
<>raised and restore the body to its former position. This
<>a1sana strengthens the backbone.
<NI>2) {%S4alabha1sana.%} Lie flat on the sheet, face downwards.
<>Keep the legs close together and raise the feet up with
<>the heels touching each other. Place the hands close
<>to the body on either side and close the fists upwards.
<>Place the fists and shoulders close to the ground and
<>make the whole body stiff after inhaling the breath.
<>Then try to raise the legs. Support the weight of the
<>body with the breast and hands. This is possible by [Page093-a+ 65]
<>pressing the fists, firmly against the ground. Until the
<>a1sana is completed, do not send out the breath. Keep
<>the legs straight and stiff. The lower abdomen and legs
<>may be raised slightly. This makes the a1sana complete.
<>On feeling suffocation, the legs must be brought down
<>slowly.
<NI>Besides these, there are many other a1sanas like Dhanur-
<>a1sana, Pas4cima1ta1na1sana, Hala1sana, Mayu1ra1sana,
<>Sarva1n3ga1sana, Matsya1sana, S4i1rs2a1sana, Arddhamatsy-
<>endra1sana, Pa1dahasta1sana, Trikon2a1sana, Ud2d2i1ya1sana,
<>Nauli, Vipari1takaran2i, Yogamudra1, S4ava1sana, etc. (See
<>under Yoga).
<HI>A1S4A1VAHA I. A son of Kas4yapa and Aditi. From Vis2n2u
<>Brahma1, from Brahma1 Mari1ci and from Mari1ci Kas4yapa
<>were born. Kas4yapa married Aditi, daughter of Daks2a.
<>Aditi gave birth to ten sons: Br2hadbha1nu, Caks2ur-
<>a1tma1, Vibha1vasu, R2ci1ka, Savita1, Arka, Bha1nu, A1s4a1vaha,
<>Ravi and Vivasva1n. Vaivasvata Manu was the son of
<>Vivasva1n. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 1, Verse 42).
<HI>A1S4A1VAHA II. A prince of the Vr2s2n2i dynasty. He was
<>present at the Svayam3vara of Draupadi1. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 19).
<HI>A1S4RAMA. Asramites (Inmates of an A1s4rama) have to pass
<>through four stages. The four stages of Brahmacarya,
<>Ga1rhasthya, Va1naprastha and Sannya1sa are known as
<>the four A1s4ramas. Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part III, Chapter 9
<>describes each of the A1s4ramas as follows:
<NI>1. {%Brahmacarya.%} “After Upanayana a boy should
<>maintain a Brahmaca1ri1's vrata, engage himself in the
<>study of the Vedas, suppress his indriyas (the five
<>senses) and live in the house of the preceptor. Living
<>there with proper observance of s4auca, customs and
<>vratas he should serve and attend on the Guru. The
<>study of Vedas should be with proper observance of
<>Vratas and steady attention. A Brahmaca1ri1 should
<>worship with concentration, the Sun and Agni at the
<>time of the two sandhya1s (dawn and dusk) and after
<>that he should do obeisance to the Guru. When the Guru
<>stands, he should also be standing. When the guru walks,
<>he should walk behind him and when he sits, he should
<>sit in a lower position. The S4is2ya (disciple-pupil) should
<>not do anything against the guru. When the guru him-
<>self asks, the S4is2ya should sit in front of him and recite
<>Vedas without attending to anything else. After that,
<>with his permission he may eat food which has been
<>got by begging. The S4is2ya may take his bath in the
<>water only after the A1ca1rya (guru) has taken his bath
<>in it. Everyday the Camata, darbha, water and flowers
<>which the guru needs, must be brought and supplied
<>(by the S4is2ya).
<NI>2. {%Ga1rhasthya.%} After the study of the Vedas the intelli-
<>gent s4is2ya gives Gurudaks2in2a1 (Payment to the precep-
<>tor) and with the consent of the Guru, enters into
<>Gr2hastha1s4rama. Then he is to marry and by earning
<>money from a suitable occupation, should fulfil all
<>obligations of a Gr2hastha according to his capacity.
<>The Gr2hastha who worships the Pitr2s with Pin2d2ada1na
<>(offerings of rice balls), Devas with Ya1gas (sacrifices),
<>R2s2is with Sva1dhya1ya (self discipline), Praja1patis with
<>begetting of children, spirits with bali (offering of food
<>etc.) and the whole world with love, attains the holy
<>world by his own virtuous deeds. Gr2hastha1s4rama is the
<>only source of support for sannya1si1s and brahmaca1ri1s
<>who beg their food. Therefore feeding them is an act
<>of nobility. Bra1hman2as travel from country to country [Page093-b+ 65]
<>to study Vedas, for pilgrimage and for seeing the places.
<>The Gr2hastha is the only refuge and support of those
<>who are homeless, who do not carry their food with
<>them and those who spend the night wherever they
<>reach. If such people come to his house, the Gr2hastha
<>should welcome them with kind and loving words, and
<>give them bed, seat and food. The guest who leaves a
<>house disappointed, is really departing after transfer-
<>ring his own sins to that householder and taking away
<>all the virtuous deeds of the householder. It is not
<>proper for the Gr2hastha to treat a guest with disrespect,
<>to behave rudely or treacherously towards him, to regret
<>what has been given to the guest, or to obstruct or
<>rebuke him. The Gr2hastha who performs the supreme
<>duty of Gr2hastha1s4rama in this way properly, is liberated
<>from all secular bonds and reaches the noblest worlds.
<NI>3. {%Va1naprastha.%} After having finished all his duties in
<>this way, to his satisfaction, the Gr2hastha, with the
<>commencement of old age, should go to the forest, either
<>after entrusting his wife to his sons or taking her also
<>with him. There, he should use leaves, roots and fruits
<>for his food, grow hair and beard, sleep on the bare
<>ground, lead the life of a ta1pasa and receive and honour
<>all classes of guests. His clothes, sheets and blankets
<>should be of deer-skin and darbha grass. The rule is
<>that he should bathe three times a day. Worship of gods,
<>performing homas, hospitality to all guests, mendicancy
<>-all these are the laudable features of Va1naprastha.
<>Any oil that is available in the forest is to be used for
<>his oil bath. Enduring heat and cold, performing tapas,
<>are also his duties. The Muni who observes this rule in
<>Va1naprastha with due austerity, burns up all his evils as
<>with fire and attains the eternal worlds.
<NI>4. {%Sannya1sa.%} The fourth A1s4rama is that of the Sannya1si1.
<>Before entering upon the fourth A1s4rama one has to
<>renounce the love of travel, wealth and wife and also
<>give up all spirit of rivalry. One who embraces sann-
<>ya1sa should abandon completely the efforts for the
<>three Purus2a1rthas of Dharma, Artha and Ka1ma, treat
<>friends and foes alike and continue to love all living
<>beings. Not even a single creature should be offended
<>by thought, word or deed. Conquering all passions,
<>the Sannya1si1 should renounce all bonds and attach-
<>ments. He should not stay in a village more than one
<>night and in a town more than five nights. Even that
<>should be in such a way that no one feels any love or
<>hatred towards him. For sustaining life, he should go
<>about begging food from the houses of the people of
<>the three castes--Brahmins, Ks2atriyas and Vais4yas. It
<>should be after all people have taken their food and
<>put out the cooking fire. The Sannya1si1 should cast
<>away all vices like Ka1ma, Krodha, Garva, Lobha, and
<>Moha and should not have any thought of self in any-
<>thing. The Muni who goes about giving shelter to all
<>creatures will not have to fear any creature. The
<>Bra1hman2a who follows the Sannya1sa1s4rama as described
<>above with a pure heart and without difficulty will
<>shine like fire without fuel and attain Brahmaloka in
<>peace.
<HI>A1S4RAMAVA1SA PARVA. One of the Parvas in the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1S4RAMAVA1SIKA PARVA. One of the Parvas in the
<>Maha1bha1rata. (See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>A1S4RA1VYA. A muni (sage) in Indra's assembly. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 18). [Page094-a+ 65]
<HI>A1STI1KA. The son of the Mahars2i Jaratka1ru and his wife,
<>also named Jaratka1ru. He stopped King Janamejaya's
<>Sarpasatra and saved the na1gas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There is a story about A1sti1ka's birth in the
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata. Long ago the people of the world were
<>so much troubled by the serpents, that they sought pro-
<>tection from Kas4yapa Praja1pati. To find a remedy for
<>this, Kas4yapa discussed the matter with Brahma1. To
<>put an end to the troubles from the serpents, Brahma1
<>suggested that a number of mantras and a deity as the
<>basis of those mantras should be created. Accordingly
<>Kas4yapa created many mantras and Manasa1 Devi1 as the
<>basic deity of those mantras. She is named “Manasa1-
<>devi1” because Kas4yapa created her by his mental
<>power. Manasa1devi1 has eleven other names also, name-
<>ly Jaratka1ru, Jagatgauri1, Siddhayogini1, Vais2n2avi1, Na1ga-
<>bhagini1, S4aivi1, Na1ges4vari1, Jaratka1rupriya1, A1sti1kama1ta1,
<>Vis2ahara1 and Maha1jn5a1nayuta1.
<NI>Manasa1devi1 (Jaratka1ru) when quite young, went to
<>Kaila1sa for doing tapas (penance). There she did tapas
<>to S4iva for a thousand years. At last S4iva appeared and
<>blessed her with divine wisdom. She returned with
<>great learning and devotion. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<NI>At that time, a Muni (sage) named Jaratka1ru, when
<>travelling through the forest happened to see his pitr2s
<>(souls of forefathers) hanging over a precipice at
<>the end of a blade of grass. They were hanging preca-
<>riously at the end of a reed grass, head downwards,
<>about to fall into the abyss. Jaratka1ru enquired why
<>they were lying in that condition. They explained that
<>they were in that plight because their descendant
<>Jaratka1ru had no children. As he is a bachelor there
<>is no hope either, of his having any issue. Since he
<>has no children, we will not get to heaven, they added.
<>To save the Pitr2s from their predicament, Jaratka1ru
<>decided to marry. But he wished to marry a woman
<>who had the same name as his. Once Va1suki met
<>Jaratka1ru and told him that he had a sister named
<>Jaratka1ru and that he would be very happy if Jaratka1ru
<>married her. Jaratka1ru accepted the offer readily and
<>married Jaratka1ru.
<NI>After their marriage, while they were living together
<>in a place called Pus2kara ti1rtha, an unexpected event
<>happened which interrupted the happy course of their
<>life. One evening, the husband was sleeping with his
<>head in the wife's lap, under a tree. The sun was about
<>to set. As the Mahars2i did not wake up before sunset, the
<>wife became anxious. It is believed that he who does not
<>wake up before sunrise and he who does not offer pray-
<>ers at dusk will be guilty of the sin of Brahmahatya1 (kill-
<>ing a Brahmin). Nor was it proper to wake him up from
<>a sound sleep. But in the end, she did wake him up.
<>The husband sprang up in great fury. He renounced
<>the wife then and there. Weeping bitterly, she begged
<>for his forgiveness. At last Jaratka1ru relented and
<>told her: “You will have a very noble, brilliant, re-
<>nowned, virtuous, scholarly and devout son who will be
<>a devotee of Vis2n2u and a preserver of the family”.
<>After this Manasa1devi1 set out to Kaila1sa. When she
<>reached there Parama-S4iva and Pa1rvati1 comforted her.
<NI>Manasa1devi1 was pregnant. The precepts and spiritual
<>advice given by Jaratka1ru, Parama-S4iva and Pa1rvati1
<>were heard by the child in the womb and so even before
<>his birth he became a Jn5a1ni1 and a yogi1. In due course [Page094-b+ 65]
<>Manasa1devi1 gave birth to a son who was a part of
<>Na1ra1yan2a (Vis2n2u). Since he was the son of Manasa1-
<>devi1 who had deep devotion to the Guru and to the
<>Gods, the boy was named A1sti1ka.
<NI>The Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, gives another reason for
<>giving this name to the boy. When the sage Jaratka1ru
<>abandoned his wife, he had blessed her saying that the
<>child in her womb would be a brilliant and devoted
<>son. That is why this boy came to be called A1sti1ka.
<NI>2) {%Boyhood%} A1sti1ka was taught Veda, Veda1m3gas etc.
<>by Parama-S4iva himself. After receiving the blessings
<>of Parama-S4iva, A1sti1ka went to Pus2kara ti1rtha and did
<>tapas to Vis2n2u for many years. Having received Vis2n2u's
<>blessings also, he returned to Kaila1sa. After living there
<>happily with his mother for some time, one day they
<>started to the A1s4rama of Kas4yapa Praja1pati, the
<>father of Manasa1devi1. Kas4yapa was very much pleased
<>to see his noble-hearted daughter and her brilliant
<>son. To enhance the fame and accomplishments of
<>the boy Kas4yapa gave a sumptuous feast to ten crores
<>of Brahmins. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>Va1suki was Manasa1devi1's brother. A1sti1ka grew up
<>there under the care of Va1suki. It was Cyavana Muni
<>who taught Sa1m3gavedas to A1sti1ka, at this time. (M.B.,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 18).
<NI>3) {%A1sti1ka at the Sarpasatra.%} Once King Pari1ks2it, the
<>son of Abhimanyu was travelling through the forest for
<>hunting animals. He picked up a dead snake with the
<>tip of his bow and put it on the shoulder of a sage
<>named “S4ami1ka”. S4ami1ka's son, S4r2m3gi1 came to know
<>of this. In his anger, S4r2m3gi1 pronounced a curse that
<>King Pari1ks2it should die within seven days by the bite
<>of Taks2aka. When Pari1ks2it heard of this, he had a
<>palace built on a single pillar in the middle of the
<>ocean, quite inaccessible to Taks2aka and took shelter
<>there. The most famous physicians and wizards were
<>engaged to ward off the approach of Taks2aka to that
<>place. Six days passed like this. On the seventh day,
<>determined to make a final attempt, Taks2aka disguised
<>himself as an old Bra1hman2a and set out to the King's
<>place of shelter. On his way he met Dhanvantari who
<>was proceeding to Pari1ks2it to protect him. They be-
<>came friends and as a result of it, Dhanvantari returned
<>after receiving a large number of rare precious stones
<>given to him by Taks2aka. Assuming the form of a small
<>worm, Taks2aka secretly entered into a fruit which was
<>to be presented to the King. As soon as the King took
<>that fruit in his hand, Taks2aka took his own shape
<>and size and bit the King who died immediately.
<>Janamejaya was the son of this King Pari1ks2it.
<NI>Janamejaya performed all the obsequies of his father.
<>After that, in a spirit of revenge, with the object of
<>annihilating the whole race of serpents, he summoned
<>Bra1hman2as to conduct a sarpa satra (snake sacrifice).
<NI>In the sacrificial fire specially prepared at that ya1ga,
<>many serpents were being burnt up. It seemed that the
<>whole race of serpents would shortly be wiped out.
<>But Taks2aka alone was not to be seen. The officiating
<>priests were beginning to get angry. Impatient cries
<>of Where is Taks2aka rent the air. The frightened
<>Taks2aka fled for life to the palace of his friend Indra
<>and there lay down, curling round Indra's cot. When
<>the priests understood this they decided to use their
<>charms and mantras which would bring Indra, his bed,
<>cot and all, along with Taks2aka to the sacrificial fire. [Page095-a+ 65]
<>At this stage, all the gods rushed to Manasa1devi1 and
<>fell at her feet and begged her to save the situation.
<>The kindhearted Devi1 called her son A1sti1ka and advis-
<>ed him to persuade Janamejaya to stop the sarpa-
<>satra. A1sti1ka went to Janamejaya and requested him
<>to give him the lives of Taks2aka and Indra as a gift.
<>Janamejaya, after consulting the munis and priests
<>and at their advice, agreed to do so. In this way, the
<>Sarpasatra was stopped and the remaining serpents
<>escaped with their lives. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama

<>Parva, M.B.).

<>he was killed with a mace thrown at him. (Chapter 5,
<>Mausala Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BABHRUMA1LI. A sage. He was a lively member of the

<HI>BABHRUVA1HANA. A son of Arjuna.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} When the Pa1n2d2avas were residing in Indra-
<>prastha after marrying Pa1n5ca1li1, Na1rada went to see
<>them once. With a view to avoiding any quarrel bet-
<>ween the Pa1n2d2avas over the one wife they jointly possess-
<>ed, Na1rada suggested that each should take Pa1n5ca1li1
<>for a year in turn and he who violated the arrange-
<>ment should go to the forest for a year. Once Arjuna
<>went to the house of Yudhis2t2hira who was with Pa1n5ca1li
<>and for thus violating the arrangement Arjuna had to
<>go to the forest for a year. During this exile while he
<>was staying at Gan3ga1dva1ra he married the serpent girl,
<>Ulu1pi and got a son called Ira1va1n of her.
<NI>After that he went to a country called Man2alu1r. At
<>that time that country was being ruled by a king called
<>Citra1n3gada. Prabhan5jana one of the forefathers of
<>Citra1n3gada had, by hard penance for a progeny, acquir-
<>ed from S4iva a boon and each of his successors got a
<>son each to maintain the line. But when it came to
<>Citra1n3gada to his surprise he got a girl instead of a son.
<>But he got her up as a son and named her Citra1n3gada.
<>It was when she was ready for marriage that Arjuna
<>went there. The king received Arjuna with respect and
<>after enquiring about his welfare requested him to marry
<>his daughter. Arjuna married her and stayed there for
<>three months. Leaving that place Arjuna went to
<>Pan5cati1rtha and there he gave salvation to the celestial
<>maidens who were lying in the ti1rthas as crocodiles.
<>When he went back to Man2alu1r Citra1n3gada1 had deli-
<>vered a son whom he named Babhruva1hana. Promising [Page097-a+ 65]
<>them that he would take them later to Hastina1pura, he
<>left the place.
<NI>2) {%His fate to kill his own father.%} It was by a ruse that
<>Arjuna made Bhi1s2ma fall. Arjuna put S4ikhan2d2i1 before
<>his chariot and Bhi1s2ma refused to take arms against a
<>eunuch and accepted defeat. But Gan3ga1devi1 witnessing
<>the battle between Bhi1s2ma, her son, and Arjuna from
<>above could not bear this foul play and so cursed that
<>Arjuna would die at the hands of his son. Ulu1pi the
<>serpent wife of Arjuna heard this curse and went to her
<>father Kauravya who in turn went to Gan3ga1 and begged
<>for a relief from the curse. Gan3ga1devi1 then said that
<>Arjuna would be killed by Babhruva1hana but would be
<>brought to life by Ulu1pi by placing the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1
<>stone on the dead man's breast.
<NI>3) {%The killing of Arjuna.%} The Maha1bha1rata battle was
<>over. When Yudhis2t2hira was performing the As4vamedha
<>ya1ga Arjuna conducted a victory march with the ya1ga
<>horse. On his way he reached Man2alu1r. At once Ulu1pi
<>called Babhruva1hana and asked him to challenge Arjuna.
<>Babhruva1hana with his bow and arrows attacked Arjuna
<>and in the grim battle that followed Arjuna fell dead.
<>Seeing this Citra1n3gada1 came to the place of battle
<>weeping and abused Ulu1pi for persuading Babhruva1hana
<>to kill his own father. Ulu1pi immediately went to the
<>serpent world and brought the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 stone and
<>as she placed it on Arjuna's breast he came to life as if
<>waking up from a sleep. When he saw Citra1n3gada1,
<>Babhruva1hana and Ulu1pi1 he smiled and asked them
<>why they had all come there. Ulu1pi1 then explained to
<>him the story of the curse and extremely pleased over
<>the end of the curse Arjuna took them all to Hastina1-
<>pura. (Chapters 218 to 210 of A1di Parva and Chapters
<>79 to 82 of As4vamedha Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%} (1) On reaching Hastina1pura S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>gave Babhruva1hana as a present a chariot drawn by
<>divine horses. (S4loka 6, Chapter 88, As4vamedha
<>Parva, M.B.).

<>suta and Man2ipures4vara.

<HI>BADARI1PA1CANA TI1RTHA. (BADARAPA1CANA). A
<>sacred place in Kuruks2etra. If one lives here fasting for

<HI>BA1HU I. A king of the Su1rya-vam3s4a (solar dynasty). He
<>was the father of Sagara. He is known by the name
<>Suba1hu also. This king was once defeated in a battle and
<>being weary and sad he entered the hermitage of Aurva.
<>His queen was given poison by another wife of the
<>King. But the child in her womb did not die. The queen
<>wanted to jump into the fire in which the body of her
<>husband was to be burned. But Aurva told her that her
<>son would become a famous king and that she should
<>not commit suicide. Thus she desisted from committing
<>suicide. A son was born to her. As she had been poison-
<>ed when the child was in her womb the son was given
<>the name Sagara (with poison). It is said in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva that this prince became a famous

<>made about this king in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva,

<HI>BAHUBHA1RYA1TVA. (Polygamy). Polygamy was a
<>custom in vogue in ancient India. It was not prohibit-
<>ed for a man to have more than one wife. It was
<>customary to give dowry also. It is said in the R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 10, Anuva1ka 3, Su1kta 11 that the bride should
<>proceed to the house of the husband, after the marriage.
<>A spell (mantra) meant for keeping down one's co-wife,
<>is seen in the R2gveda, Man2d2ala 10, Anuva1ka 11, Su1kta
<>17. It is a prayer to destroy the love of husband for a
<>co-wife and to direct that love towards oneself. The
<>deity of this spell is Indra1n2i1 the wife of Indra who was
<>a polygamist. In those days marriage was an essential
<>duty. Widow marriage was not forbidden.
<HI>BA1HUDA1. A holy bath. If one stays in this place for a
<>night in celibacy and fast, one will get the fruits of
<>performing a sacrifice to devas (gods). The modern

<HI>BAKA I. A demon. The Pa1n2d2avas escaping from the
<>trap of Arakkilla (lac-house) through a secret tunnel
<>went to the village Ekacakra1 on the banks of the
<>river Gan3ga1 and stayed there in the house of a brahmin.
<>Baka was a demon who was terrorising the villagers
<>there. He used to come to the village freely and carry
<>away people for his food. Because of this nobody lived
<>in peace and so they all joined together and decided
<>to send one man daily with plenty of other eatables to
<>the demon in this cave. Days went by like that and
<>one day the turn came to the brahmin who was shelter-
<>ing the Pa1n2d2avas. That brahmin had besides his wife
<>one son and a daughter. The problem arose as to who
<>should go to the demon. The father was willing but
<>the wife did not want him to go and vice versa. The
<>children began to cry and hearing the noise Kunti1,
<>mother of the Pa1n2d2avas, went there to enquire and
<>learned the tragic story of the family. She immediately
<>went to Bhi1ma and acquainted him with the problem
<>before the brahmin. Bhi1ma at once volunteered to go
<>to the demon deciding to kill the man-eater and thus
<>putting an end to his depredations.
<NI>Bhi1ma started on his journey to the demon carrying a
<>cartload of rice and curry. Deliberately Bhi1ma arrived
<>at the place of the demon very late. Baka rolled his
<>eyes in anger at the sight of the late-comer. But
<>Bhi1ma without heeding him sat in front of the demon
<>and started eating the rice and curry. Baka charged
<>at Bhi1ma with fury but Bhi1ma defended and a battle
<>ensued in which Baka was killed and he fell dead
<>like a mountain-head dropping down.
<F>*) Kirmi1ra, a demon, was the brother of Baka. (S4loka 23, Chapter 11, Aran2ya Parva, M.B.).
<>{%f%} It is in the 10th Skandha of Bha1gavata that the story of this Baka occurs. But in the vernacular translation of the same the story is
<>not so clear. Hence the original in Sanskrit is quoted below:

<>la) on the banks of the river Yamuna1 when the
<>demon, Baka, despatched by Kam3sa, went to them in

<>one of the pa1rs2adas who then came to the scene to
<>quell the trouble. (As2t2ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>BALA IX. A son of Ma1ya1sura. He lived in a place in
<>the netherlands called Atala. He created ninetysix
<>different kinds of magic and gave them to the asura
<>magicians who by the use of them gave the devas
<>immense trouble.
<NI>Once when Bala1sura yawned three bad women, Svairin2i1,
<>Ka1mini1 and Pum3s4cali1 were born. They had with them
<>a potable substance called Ha1t2aka which they gave to
<>men whom they liked and after enlivening the sex
<>impulse in them enjoyed a sexual life with them to
<>their heart's content. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<>Once during a fight between Indra and Jalandhara
<>Bala defeated Indra in a pathetic way. Indra then sought
<>refuge in him and praised him with songs. Flattered
<>by this Bala asked Indra to ask of him whatever he
<>wanted and the sly Indra requested for the physical
<>body of Bala. Without the least hesitation Bala cut his
<>body into pieces and gave him. Indra threw away the
<>cut pieces to different sides and all the places where
<>these pieces fell were at once transformed into Diamond

<HI>BALABHADRA. (Balabhadrara1ma, Balara1ma, Baladeva).
<>The elder brother of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the eighth incarna-
<>tion of Maha1vis2n2u.
<F>*) Since the life of Balabhadra is so mixed with that of Kr2s2n2a a complete life story of Balara1ma could be had only if it is read along
<>with that of Kr2s2n2a.</F>
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} When the number of wicked kings increased
<>Bhu1mi1devi1 (goddess of Earth) turned herself into a cow
<>and took refuge in Maha1vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u then pro-
<>mised to be born as the sons of Vasudeva named Bala-
<>bhadrara1ma and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and destroy the wicked.
<>Vasudeva was the son of the Ya1dava, S4u1rasena, King
<>of Madhura1. To Devaka the brother of another Ya1dava
<>King, Ugrasena, was born a daughter Devaki1. The
<>marriage of Devaki1 with Vasudeva was celebrated but
<>on the same day an As4ari1rin2i1 (a heavenly voice from
<>above) said that the eighth child of Devaki1 would
<>kill Kam3sa. Instantly Kam3sa put both Vasudeva and
<>Devaki1 in jail. The first six sons born to Devaki1 were
<>killed the moment they were born by striking them
<>against the ground. Devaki1 became pregnant for the
<>seventh time. The babe in the womb was Ananta in-
<>carnate by Vis2n2u's directive to be of help to him when
<>he would also be born soon as Kr2s2n2a. Therefore it
<>was necessary to save the child from the cruel hands
<>of Kam3sa as it was certain he would kill the babe the
<>same way he had killed all the others before. So he
<>ordered Ma1ya1devi1 to take the child from the womb of
<>Devaki1 and place it in that of Rohin2i1, another wife of
<>Vasudeva. Ma1ya1devi1 did so and the boy got the name
<>Sam3ghars2an2a, also because of this. The news spread
<>that Devaki1 aborted. Rohin2i1 delivered a boy and was
<>named Sam3ghars2an2a alias Balabhadrara1ma. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>2) {%The colour of Balara1ma and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is
<>the eighth child of Devaki1. The elder brother Balara1ma
<>is white in complexion while the younger, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is
<>black in complexion. There is a story behind this. The
<>devas decided to be born as Gopa1las (shepherds) in the
<>earth to be of help to Kr2s2n2a in his duty of killing the
<>wicked. They informed Maha1vis2n2u of their decision
<>and the Lord was immensely pleased. He then took
<>one white hair from his head and said that it would go
<>to Rohin2i1's womb and change into Balara1ma and [Page100-a+ 64]
<>taking a black hair said that it would go into Devaki1's
<>womb and change into S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. It was thus that
<>Balabhadra became white and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a black. (Chap-
<>ter 199, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Brothers.%} Balabhadrara1ma had six brothers born of
<>his mother Rohin2i1. They were: Gada, Sa1ran2a, Durd-
<>dama, Vipula, Dhruva, and Kr2ta. (Navama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) Till their marriage S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a spent his childhood
<>in Am3ba1d2i and Balara1ma, in Madhura1. Once the sage
<>Garga went to the house of Vasudeva and it was he
<>who then told the story behind the births of Balara1ma
<>and Kr2s2n2a. Hearing this Vasudeva went to Madhura1
<>and brought Balabhadrara1ma also to Am3ba1d2i. Garga-
<>muni then performed all those sacred rites which were
<>usually done to boys of that age and both of them then
<>remained in Am3ba1d2i. Several important events happen-
<>ed during their stay here, notable among which are:
<>Pu1tana1moks2am (killing of the demoness Pu1tana1 and
<>giving her salvation). S4akat2a1suravadha (killing the
<>asura, S4akat2a), Tr2n2a1varttavadha (killing the asura,
<>Tr2n2a1vartta), Vatsa1suravadha (killing the asura,
<>Vatsa), Bakavadha (killing the demon bird, Baka),
<>Agha1suravadha (killing the asura, Agha), Dhenuka1-
<>suravadha (killing the asura, Dhenuka), Ka1liamardana
<>(beating the snake, Ka1lia) and Pralambavadha (killing
<>Pralamba). (See under Kr2s2n2a for more details).
<NI>Kam3sa conducted a Ca1papu1ja1 (worship of the bow) to
<>kill Kr2s2n2a. It was on a festive scale and both Kr2s2n2a and
<>Balara1ma went to Madhura1 to attend the same. There
<>they killed Kam3sa and after that went to the a1s4rama
<>of Sa1ndi1pani Mahars2i for education. When they complet-
<>ed their education they at the request of the preceptor
<>gave as Gurudaks2in2a1 (The fee you pay in the end for
<>the instructions given) the lost child of the guru. Then
<>they went to Madhura1 and there several events took
<>place, important among which was the fight between
<>Kr2s2n2a and Jara1sandha. By this time the Ya1davas
<>were becoming lean financially and so to make some
<>money Kr2s2n2a and Ra1ma went to the diamond-infested
<>mountain of Gomantaka. On their way they met
<>Paras4ura1ma doing penance under a Banyan tree. On
<>the advice of Paras4ura1ma they killed Sr2ga1lavasudeva
<>and got immense wealth. On their return Ra1ma and
<>Kr2s2n2a along with many Ya1davas went and settled down
<>in the island, Dva1raka1, in the western ocean. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Marriage.%} Before the advent of Balara1ma and Kr2s2n2a
<>the island Dva1raka1 was known as Kus4asthali1. It was
<>ruled over by a famous Ra1jars2i, Revata. This king was
<>the son of King A1nartta and grandson of emperor
<>S4arya1ti. Revata got a hundred sons, Kukudmin being
<>the first and a daughter named Revati1. When the time
<>for marriage of his daughter came the King was anxious
<>to find out a fitting husband for her and he went to
<>Brahmaloka to take the advice of Brahma1. Revati1 also
<>accompanied him. There stupefied he saw Vedas, Yajn5as,
<>mountains, rivers, oceans, R2tus, all in divine figures
<>standing before Brahma1, worshipping him. The sweet
<>celestial songs gave them both untold happiness. He
<>then told Brahma1 the purpose of his visit and Brahma1
<>meditating for some time told him that Balabhadrara1ma,
<>son of Vasudeva, was the only one person suited for
<>her. The king returned to Dva1raka1 and gave his [Page100-b+ 65]
<>daughter in marriage to Balara1ma. (Saptama Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>6) {%A pilgrimage.%} When the great Pa1n2d2ava-Kaurava
<>battle started Kr2s2n2a became the charioteer of Arjuna
<>and Balara1ma went to the forest, Naimis4a. He was not
<>much interested in the battle. At the forest of Naimis2a
<>he saw Su1ta telling Pura1n2ic stories to the several sages
<>assembled there before him. Su1ta did not rise up when
<>he saw Balara1ma and the latter moved to anger very
<>soon cut off the head of Su1ta. The sages assembled there
<>decried the act of Balara1ma and lamented deeply over
<>the incident. At this Balara1ma promised that he would
<>give birth, from the dead body of Su1ta, to one who will
<>be well versed in all the Vedas, s4a1stras and sciences. The
<>sages then blessed Balara1ma.
<NI>During that time there lived in the vicinity of Naimis2a
<>forest a demon called Balvala (Vatkala). He used to
<>annoy the sages there and the sages requested Bala-
<>ra1ma to put a stop to the atrocities of that demon. He
<>immediately killed the demon by his weapon, Hala,
<>and then raised from the dead body of Su1ta a pan2d2ita
<>of great erudition. Later, to remedy the sin of killing
<>Su1ta, Balara1ma, repentant, visited all the sacred places
<>in Bha1rata. Once when he heard about the grim battle
<>between Duryodhana and Bhi1masena, he went to the
<>battle-field and tried his best to stop the war. Dis-
<>appointed he returned to Dva1raka1. (Das4ama Skandha,
<>Chapter 79, Bha1gavata).
<NI>7) {%Death.%} Once the r2s2is Na1rada, Kan2va and Vis4va1-
<>mitra came to Dva1raka1. To make fun of them some of
<>the Ya1davas dressed a Ya1dava like a pregnant woman
<>and producing her before the sages asked them what
<>child she would deliver. Enraged at this the munis
<>said in one voice that she would deliver a mace and that
<>iron mace would be the cause of the end of all
<>Ya1davas.
<NI>After the Maha1bha1rata battle the Ya1dava dynasty re-
<>mained alive only for thirtysix years. After that by
<>the curse of the brahmin the Ya1davas were all killed in
<>a drunken brawl between themselves in the very pre-
<>sence of Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra. This happened on the
<>shore of Prabha1sa ti1rtha and Balara1ma was sitting
<>there then in deep meditation. Suddenly the soul of
<>Balara1ma went out from his mouth in the shape of a
<>white serpent and the serpent entering the nether world
<>was given a warm welcome by the prominent serpents
<>there. (Mausala Parva, M.B.).

<>vision of him in the shape of a cow-calf. After that in
<>the place where S4iva appeared as calf a S4ivalin3ga
<>arose. It began to grow to the extent of an atom daily.
<>But the growth ceased, when an outcaste who became
<>so by Karma (action) visited it. (Skandha Pura1n2a
<>3-2-27).
<HI>BALA1KA (VALA1KA). A forester. This forester used to
<>go for hunting and he gave everything he got to his old
<>parents without reserving anything for himself. One
<>day he did not find any animal even though he had
<>made a thorough search in the forest. He was much
<>worried. At last he reached the bank of a river. He
<>saw an extraordinary animal drinking water. He had
<>never seen such an animal before. [Page101-b+ 63]
<NI>It was a peculiar creature. That creature had done
<>penance before Brahma1, from its young age with the view
<>of destroying everything. Brahma1 appeared before the
<>creature and granted it the boon that it would have the
<>power to make anything blind. Brahma1 also said that
<>anybody who killed the creature would be given a place
<>in the realm of Gods. The creature had been wandering
<>in the forest making blind every creature it met, and
<>one day it was drinking water and it was then that
<>Vala1ka shot it down. As soon as the creature fell down
<>the gods showered flowers, and took him to the realm
<>of Gods in a divine chariot. (M.B., Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 69).
<HI>BALA1KA1TI1RTHA. (VALA1KA1TI1RTHA). A holy place
<>near the mountain of Gandhama1dana. Those who bathe
<>in this holy bath would become as bright and famous as
<>devas (gods) It is mentioned so in the Maha1bha1rata,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 19.
<HI>BALA1KA1S4VA. (VALA1KA1S4VA). He is the grandson of
<>the hermit Jahnu and the son of Aja otherwise called
<>Sindhudvi1pa. Bala1ka1s4va had a son called Kus4ika. (M.B.,
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 49, Stanza 3).
<HI>BA1LAKHILYA(S). (VA1LAKHILYAS). A group of
<>hermits.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Sixty thousand hermits were born to Kratu,
<>one of the Saptars2is (seven hermits), by his wife,
<>Santati.
<F>*) In some other Pura1n2as the mother of Ba1lakhilyas is given the name ‘Sannati’. This may be a mistake in the manuscript.</F> They are called Ba1lakhilyas. Everyone of
<>them was only the size of half a thumb, but they were
<>as bright as the blazing sun and had attained control
<>over their senses. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 10).
<NI>2) {%Garud2a (Eagle) and Ba1lakhilya(s).%} A story connect-
<>ing the birth of Garud2a with Ba1lakhilyas occurs in
<>the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Once Kas4yapa Praja1pati performed a sacrifice to
<>obtain children. The work of bringing firewood for
<>the sacrifice was entrusted to Indra and the other
<>devas (Gods) and the Ba1lakhilyas. When Indra was
<>heaping up on heaps pieces of big logs the Ba1lakhilyas
<>who were very small were bringing in chips of
<>wood. Seeing this Indra laughed. The Ba1lakhilyas
<>got angry and stopping the work entrusted to them
<>began to do penance with a view to create an-
<>other Indra. Knowing this Indra was much flurried.
<>He went to Kas4yapa and told him everything. Kas4yapa
<>went to the Ba1lakhilyas and pacified them. At this time
<>Vinata1, a wife of Kas4yapa, was doing penance to
<>obtain a son. Kas4yapa said that the penance of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas would not be fruitless and that as a result
<>of their penance a son who would overpower Indra
<>would be born to Vinata1. Accordingly a son was born
<>to her. Garud2a was that son. The fact that Garud2a
<>overthrew Indra when he went to heaven for ambrosia,
<>is well known. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 31).
<NI>3) {%Routine of life.%} The Ba1lakhilyas live in the man2d2ala
<>of Su1rya (solar region). They travel in front of the sun
<>in the shape of birds. They wear hides of animals. They
<>are righteous and are only as big as a thumb. They are
<>very ardent in doing the works of devas (Gods). They
<>are sinless. There are Ba1lakhilyas living in the lunar
<>region also. They worship the Sun daily. All the world
<>stand firm in truth because of the penance of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas. (M.B., Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 141.). [Page102-a+ 65]
<NI>4) {%Other information.%} (1) Garud2a (Eagle) who went
<>to the realm of devas (gods) for Amrta (amb-
<>rosia) took rest on the branch of a banyan tree, and
<>that branch was broken from the tree. Sixty thousand
<>Ba1lakhilyas were doing penance hanging head down-
<>wards on that branch. Garud2a knew this only after the
<>branch was broken. Fearing the curse form them he took
<>the branch in his beak and flew about here and there.
<>At last, according to the advice of Kas4yapa, he took the
<>branch to the mount Gandhama1dana and without caus-
<>ing any harm to the small hermits placed it there.
<>(M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>(2) When Dus2yanta entered the hermitage of Kan2va
<>he saw the Ba1lakhilyas doing panance, hanging down
<>on the trees in the vicinity. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 7).
<NI>(3) In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 51, it
<>is mentioned that the Ba1lakhilyas were engaged in
<>prayer and meditations and offering oblations to fire
<>in the hermitage of Vasis2t2ha.
<NI>(4) It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 51, that in the period of the Ra1ma1yan2a, in
<>South India, when Ra1van2a was going to the house of
<>Ma1ri1ca, he saw the Ba1lakhilyas doing penance.
<NI>(5) The Ba1lakhilyas learned the Vedas and S4a1stras
<>(scriptures) sitting in the chariot of the sun. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<HI>BA1LAKHILYA SAM3HITA1. See the word Guruparam-

<HI>BALA1KI. (VALA1KI). One of the hundred sons of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra. Mention is made in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Stanza 2, that Vala1ki had been
<>present on the occasion of the svayam3vara (wedding)
<>of Draupadi1.
<HI>BA1LA1KI. A hermit. He is called Ga1rgya also as he is
<>a son of Garga. He acquired much knowledge and so
<>he became arrogant. Because of this some called him
<>Dr2ptaba1la1ki.
<NI>Once the hermit went to the King of Ka1s4i1 and told him
<>that he would impart to him the knowledge of Brahma.
<>The king replied that he would give thousand cows in
<>return. Ba1la1ki declared that the sun-god was Brahma1.
<>The king said that he had known it. Everything that
<>Ba1la1ki said had been known to the king earlier.
<>So, in the end Ba1la1ki had to become the disciple of the
<>King. Then the King took him to a man who was sleep-
<>ing. The King called the sleeping man. But he did not
<>wake up. The King woke him up and then asked the
<>hermit, where he had gone when he was sleeping. Ba1la1ki
<>could not say where men go when they are sleeping
<>and where they return from when they wake up. The
<>king said “In our sleep we attain ‘Sa1ru1pya’ (assimila-
<>tion to god). But we are not aware of it. Though
<>we get eternal bliss we do not know it. If we can get
<>eternal bliss when we keep awake that is ‘A1tmajn5a1na’
<>(knowledge of Supreme Soul). As the flames emanate
<>from fire, and as the spider weaves its net and sits in its
<>centre, the soul creates everything, controls everything
<>and pervades everything.” (Br2hada1ran2yakopanis2ad).
<HI>BALA1KS2A. An ancient king of Bha1rata. While the
<>Pa1n2d2avas were living incognito in the kingdom of Vira1t2a,
<>Duryodhana and his brothers stole the cows of Vira1t2a,
<>in consequence of which there was a battle. The devas
<>(gods) came in planes to see the fight between Arjuna
<>and the teacher Kr2pa. It is mentioned in the Maha1- [Page102-b+ 64]
<>bha1rata, Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 56, that the King Bala1ks2a
<>was there with the gods when they came to see the fight.
<HI>BALAMITRA. A king. S4atrughna who led the ya1ga
<>horse of S4ri1 Ra1ma fought with Vi1raman2i and at that
<>time Balamitra fought on the side of Vi1raman2i. (Chapter
<>40, Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BALAMODAKA. The son of Suratha, the King of
<>Kun2d2alanagari1. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 40).
<HI>BALA1NI1KA (VALA1NI1KA) I. A son of the King
<>Drupada. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 156, that As4vattha1ma1 killed him in the
<>battle of Kuruks2etra.
<HI>BALA1NI1KA (VALA1NI1KA) II. A brother of Matsya,
<>the King of Vira1t2a. During the battle of Kuruks2etra
<>he had taken the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and had fought
<>against the Kauravas. (M.B., Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>158).
<HI>BA1LASVA1MI1. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.B., S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 74).
<HI>BA1LA1VATI1. The daughter of hermit Kan2va. She did
<>penance to please the Sun to obtain a husband of a
<>very good nature. The Sun appeared before her and gave
<>her some dates and asked her to prepare food with them
<>and bring them back. Ba1la1vati1 began to cook the dates.
<>Though all the faggots she had gathered were consumed
<>it was not properly boiled. As there was no more fire-
<>wood she put her leg into the oven. Seeing this the Sun-
<>God was pleased and said “All your wishes will be
<>realized”. From that day onwards that place was called
<>by the name ‘Ba1la1pa’. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 152).
<HI>BA1LAVINAS2T2AKA. The hero of a story, given in Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalambaka, Taran3ga six, to show
<>that it is not good to make others angry. The story is
<>as follows:--
<NI>Long ago there was a Brahmin named Rudra S4arma1.
<>He had two wives. Both gave birth to a son each. The
<>elder wife died and her son also was brought up by the
<>younger wife. Being jealous she fed the child with food
<>too hard for the child and it became lean with stomach
<>swollen and the bones projecting. It looked an uncouth
<>figure. Seeing him like this Rudra S4arma1 called him Ba1la-
<>vinas2t2aka (one who is lost when he is a boy). He
<>gradually grew up. When he was only five years old he
<>showed extraordinary intelligence. One day he decided
<>to teach his foster-mother a lesson. On that day he was
<>sitting alone on the lap of his father. He said to his
<>father, “Father, I have two fathers”. Thenceforward the
<>father began to doubt his wife, that she was having a
<>lover. He grew jealous. He would not talk to her. The foster-
<>mother thought Ba1lavinas2t2aka was the cause for this
<>change in her husband's behaviour. One day she called
<>the boy to her mildly and asked him for the reason for
<>the change in the behaviour of his father towards her.
<>He said that he would bring about a change in the beha-
<>viour of his father if he would be cared for properly.
<>She agreed. Then he took a mirror and held it before
<>his father and when the reflection of his father fell in
<>the mirror he said, “Father, I have two fathers”. Imme-
<>diately the doubt of his father was removed. It is not
<>right to make even a boy angry.
<HI>BA1LA1YANI. An a1ca1rya (Teacher). In Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10, it is seen that Ba1la1yani was taught Ba1la-
<>khilya sam3hita1 by Ba1s2kala. [Page103-a+ 65]
<HI>BA1LAYOGI1. A king of the An3ga dynasty. He was the
<>son of Bali, who had six sons named An3ga, Van3ga,
<>Kalin3ga, Pun2d2ra, Ba1leya and Ba1layogi1. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 277).
<HI>BALA1YUS. One of the eight sons born to Puru1ravas by
<>Urvas4i1. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i, Chapter 12).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA. (BA1LHIKA) I. A powerful king born in
<>the family of Ahara. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 67,
<>Stanza 25).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA II. A king who in his previous life was the
<>asura called Krodhavas4a. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter 96, Stanza 12, that
<>this King helped the Kauravas in the battle of Kuruk-
<>s2etra.
<HI>BA1LHI1KA III. A king who was the third son of Janame-
<>jaya and the grandson of King Kuru. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Stanza 56).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA IV. A son of Prati1pa, a King of the Kuru
<>dynasty. He had two brothers, Deva1pi and S4antanu. It
<>is said in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 94 that
<>Sunanda1, the princess of the country of S4ibi was their
<>mother. Mention is made in Bha1gavata, Skandha 9,
<>Chapter 22, Stanza 18 that this king Ba1lhi1ka had a son
<>named Somadatta. Ba1lhi1ka was a friend of the Kauravas
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas. Ba1lhi1ka exhorted them strongly, not
<>to engage in a battle. Still, when the battle was begun,
<>Ba1lhi1ka sided with the Kauravas. Ba1lhi1ka was once
<>elected as the general of eleven divisions of the army
<>of Dury odhana.
<NI>The achievements of Ba1lhi1ka in the battle of Kuruks2etra
<>are given below:--
<NI>1) There was a combat on the first day of the battle
<>between Ba1lhi1ka and Dhr2s2taketu. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Stanza 38).
<NI>2) Bhi1masena defeated Ba1lhi1ka. (M.B., Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 104, Stanza 26).
<NI>3) Fought with Drupada. (Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Stanza 18).
<NI>4) Ba1lhi1ka fought with S4ikhan2d2i1. (Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 96, Stanza 7).
<NI>5) Bhi1masena killed Ba1lhi1ka. (Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>157, Stanza 15).
<HI>BA1LHI1KA V. The charioteer of Dharmaputra. (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 58, Stanza 20).
<HI>BA1LHI1KADES4A. A country in ancient Bha1rata. Mention
<>is made about this country in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9.
<HI>BALI (MAHA1BALI) I. An emperor of the Asuras. He
<>was the son of Virocana and the grandson of Prahla1da.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and Birth.%} The Asuras or the Daityas are
<>the sons born, of his wife Diti, to Kas4yapa Praja1pati, son
<>of Mari1ci and grandson of Brahma1. There were so
<>many Asuras born as the sons of Diti. But among them
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a, Hiran2yakas4ipu, S4u1rapadma1, Sim3havaktra,
<>Ta1raka1sura and Gomukha were notorious. Of their
<>sisters Sim3hika1 and Ajamukhi1 were famous.
<NI>Four sons called Prahla1da, Sam3hra1da, Hra1da and
<>Anuhra1da were born to Hiran2yakas4ipu. Virocana was
<>the son of Prahla1da and Maha1bali was the son of Viro-
<>cana. Ba1n2a was born from Maha1bali and four crores of
<>Asuras called Niva1takavacas were born from Ba1n2a.
<NI>2) {%The churning of the ocean.%} Once Maha1bali had stolen
<>the wealth of Devendra. While he was carrying it to
<>his house, it all fell in the ocean. Maha1vis2n2u ordered
<>the devas (gods) to recover the lost wealth from the [Page103-b+ 65]
<>ocean. It was impossible to churn the ocean without
<>the help of Maha1bali. So the devas went to Maha1bali
<>and sought his help. Maha1bali agreed to help them.
<NI>The real aim of the devas was not to regain the lost
<>wealth but to obtain the celestial nectar known as Nectar
<>of Immortality (Amr2ta) and to defeat the Asuras in
<>battle. On the side of the Asuras there was the know-
<>ledge of the Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 (life-restoring remedy). So
<>the dead were being brought to life. But it was not
<>possible for devas to do so. It was to make up this
<>deficiency, by obtaining Ambrosia from the sea, that
<>the devas tried to churn the sea, under the pretence of
<>recovering the lost wealth. Mention is made in the
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 9 and Matsya Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 250 and 251 that these events took place
<>during the regime of the Indra named Mantradruma in
<>the Ca1ks2us2amanvantara (the period of the manu named
<>Ca1ks2us2a).
<NI>3) {%War with Indra.%} The great teacher S4ukra again
<>anointed Bali, who was brought to life again, as Indra.
<>After that he performed the sacrifice of Vis4vajit (con-
<>queror of the world) on behalf of Bali. Assuming the
<>responsibilities of government, Bali performed one
<>hundred As4vamedha ya1gas (Horse sacrifices) (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 8).
<NI>After the Vis4vajit sacrifice, Yajn5adeva (god of sacrifice)
<>who was greatly pleased at the sacrifice, presented Bali
<>with a divine chariot, equal in all aspects to that of
<>Indra, a golden bow, two quivers, which would never
<>become empty and a divine armour, and his grand-
<>father gave him a garland that would never fade, and
<>the teacher S4ukra gave him a divine conch, and Brahma1
<>presented a garland. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 216).
<NI>4) {%Attainment of the Position of Indra.%} Maha1vis2n2u had
<>not been on good terms with the devas, for a time.
<>Taking this opportunity, S4ukra1ca1rya the teacher of the
<>Asuras, persuaded Bali to engage the devas in a battle.
<>Bali defeated the devas completely in a pitched battle.
<>Thus the realm of the gods came under the sway of
<>Maha1bali. Once, during that period Bali invited his
<>grandfather Prahla1da to heaven and requested him to
<>accept the most honourable seat there. Prahla1da
<>accepted his invitation and anointed Bali as Indra. Bali
<>enquired of Prahla1da as to the method of carrying on
<>the government of heaven. Prahla1da said thus in reply:
<>“Only virtue will always win. Rule the kingdom without
<>deviating from virtue.” (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 74).
<>Because Bali had ruled his kingdom according to the
<>advice of Prahla1da, he became famous in the three
<>worlds. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 75).
<NI>According to the version of Bha1gavata, Prahla1da when
<>he grew old, left his kingdom in the hands of his son
<>Virocana and went to the forest for penance. Virocana
<>was not as famous as Prahla1da. After the period of
<>Virocana, Maha1bali came to the throne. He was a
<>mighty king. Within a short time he became the emperor
<>of the Asuras. It was during this period that the churn-
<>ing of the Milk Sea took place. The Asuras and the
<>Devas (gods) sat on either side and using the mount
<>Mandara as churn-drill, churned the Milk Sea and
<>obtained Amr2ta (the celestial nectar of immortality).
<>A battle took place between the Asuras and the Devas
<>for the possession of Amr2takalas4a (the Ambrosia and
<>the container) and the emperor Maha1bali was killed in
<>the battle. The Asuras carried the dead body of Maha1. [Page104-a+ 65]
<>bali to his capital, where S4ukra1ca1rya (their teacher-pri-
<>est S4ukra) brought him to life again by the help of sacred
<>herbs. Maha1bali instantly waged another war, fiercer
<>than the previous ones, with the devas, and having
<>defeated them, he drove them out of their realm and
<>brought it under control. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>5) {%The curse of Prahla1da.%} As the whole of heaven came
<>under the sway of Bali, the devas began to leave the
<>country one by one. Everybody was happy and comfort-
<>able under the rule of Bali. But the devas and Bra1h-
<>man2as were denied the privileges they deserved. They
<>approached Vis2n2u and represented their grievances.
<>Vis2n2u told them thus: “Bali is devoted to me. Still, to
<>redress your grievances I shall take the incarnation of
<>Va1mana shortly.”
<NI>In course of time the Asuras and their countries began
<>to be weakened. Seeing the approach of destruction
<>emperor Bali became thoughtful. He approached
<>Prahla1da to learn the reason. Prahla1da told Bali thus:
<>“Lord Vis2n2u is now staying in the womb of Aditi for his
<>incarnation as Va1mana. That is why the country and
<>the Asuras are subjected to destruction. Hearing this
<>Maha1bali said: “Our Ra1ks2asas are more powerful
<>than that Vis2n2u.” Hearing these haughty words of
<>Bali, Prahla1da got angry and cursed Bali “Let your
<>country be destroyed.” Bali requested Prahla1da to
<>pardon him. Prahla1da advised Bali “You will get sal-
<>vation only by relying on Vis2n2u”. (Va1mana Pura1n2a 77).
<NI>6) {%Defeated by Va1mana.%} The defeated devas had taken
<>refuge in forests. Aditi the mother of the devas was
<>very sorry at this. She shed tears before her husband
<>Kas4yapa Praja1pati, who advised his wife to take a fast
<>of twelve days, and taught her the rules and rituals of
<>the fast. Accordingly she took the fast, Vis2n2u appeared
<>before her and asked her what boon she wanted. She
<>requested Vis2n2u to take birth as her son, to drive away
<>Bali and to restore her sons, the devas (gods), to their
<>kingdom of heaven. Maha1vis2n2u agreed.
<NI>Aditi became pregnant and gave birth to the son
<>Va1mana. He was an incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u. [The
<>5th incarnation (avata1ra) of Vis2n2u].
<NI>At this time Maha1bali was performing a sacrifice on the
<>bank of the river Narmada1. Va1mana came to the place of
<>sacrifice in the dress of a hermit boy and told Maha1bali
<>that he was a helpless hermit boy and requested that
<>he might be given three steps of ground. Maha1bali
<>was pleased with the boy and told him that he was
<>willing to give the boy even the country called Bhr2n3ga1-
<>raka and that he was prepared to forego the kingly
<>pleasures for the boy. The hermit boy did not show any
<>desire for them. So many gathered round them to
<>witness this sight. The teacher S4ukra1ca1rya called Maha1-
<>bali and said that the boy was a cheat and that his
<>request should not be granted. But Maha1bali decided
<>to grant the wish of the boy and as a token of his gift
<>he began to offer the boy water from a waterpot. Then
<>the teacher got into the mouth of the pot in the shape
<>of a mote and water would not flow freely out of the
<>mouth of the pot. Knowing this Va1mana took a grass
<>of Darbha and pushed it at the mouth of the pot. The
<>grass pierced one eye of S4ukra1ca1rya. From that time
<>onwards S4ukra1ca1rya had only one eye. Water flowed
<>freely into the hands of Va1mana. S4ukra got angry and
<>cursed Bali. Va1mana began to measure the ground
<>and simultaneously began to grow. The asuras who were [Page104-b+ 65]
<>horrified at this, began to attack Va1mana with anything
<>they could lay hands on. Still Va1mana was growing.
<>Finally he became an immensely large being. With
<>one step he measured the whole of earth and with the
<>second step he took the whole of heaven. Then he
<>asked Bali, where to place the third step. Maha1bali
<>said that he had only his body left, as his own, and
<>that Va1mana might take it and complete three steps.
<>Va1mana placed his foot on the head of Bali and pushed
<>him down to Pa1ta1la (the Netherworld). Thencefor-
<>ward the asuras became the inhabitants of Pa1ta1la.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 8).
<NI>7) {%Bali and Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a visited Bali who
<>was under custody in Pa1ta1la, and said to him, “I have
<>come to save you from here. So get yourself free from
<>the custody of Maha1vis2n2u, with my help.” Hearing
<>this, Bali asked Ra1van2a to fetch the two earrings of
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu, which were shining like blazing fire
<>a little away from them. Ra1van2a moved forward to
<>take them. But he fell unconscious. Bali caused him to
<>recover and said: “These earrings were worn by my
<>great grandfather Hiran2yakas4ipu. How could you,
<>who are not even capable of taking his earrings, save
<>me from his slayer, Vis2n2u? Vis2n2u is Almighty and
<>All-powerful and Supreme Lord of everything.” Hear-
<>ing this, Ra1van2a was filled with shame and he returned.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Uttara Ka1n2d2a, Praks2ipta Sarga).
<NI>8) {%Bali born as a Gardabha (Ass).%} Bali, who was fallen
<>from power took birth in the womb of an ass and
<>roamed about. Brahma1 instructed Indra to find out
<>Bali. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 216-218).
<NI>9) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) Maha1bali shines in the durbar of Varun2a. (M.B.,

<NI>(2) Once Maha1bali went to Prahla1da and repented of
<>his sins and begged for pardon. Then he began to make
<>enquiries on spiritual matters. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 28, Stanza 3).
<NI>(3) From his childhood Maha1bali was a hater of the
<>Bra1hmanas. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 90, Stanza
<>24).
<NI>(4) Once Maha1bali was engaged in a serious contest
<>with Indra. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 223).
<NI>(5) After having lost his kingdom Maha1bali ridiculed
<>Indra in various ways. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, Chapter

<NI>(6) Once Maha1bali talked with S4ukra1ca1rya about
<>giving gifts of flower, smoke and light. (M.B., Anu-
<>s4a1sana Parva, Chapter 98, Stanza 15).
<NI>(7) Laks2mi1 Devi1 had forsaken Maha1bali because he

<HI>BALI II. A hermit. It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 10, that this hermit
<>lived in Hastina1pura.
<HI>BALI III. An incarnation of S4iva. S4iva incarnated in
<>the hermitage of the Ba1lakhilyas in the mount of
<>Gandhama1dana during the period of Vara1ha Kalpa
<>(Kalpa--one day of Brahma1 or the period of 14
<>manus). It is seen in S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atapatha Bra1hman2a
<>that Bali had four sons, called Sudha1ma1, Kas4yapa,
<>Vasis2t2ha and Virajas. [Page105-a+ 65]
<HI>BALI IV. A king of the Ya1davas. He was the son of
<>Kr2tavarman. Bali married Ca1rumati1, the daughter of
<>Rukmin2i1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<HI>BALI V. A famous monkey-king of the country of A1nava.
<>This King who was the son of Sutapas was a contem-
<>porary of the great King Sagara.
<NI>Bali did penance and Brahma1 appeared before him,
<>and blessed him and said, “You will become a great
<>sage and will live till the end of the Kalpa (a period
<>of world age). Your power will be inimitable. Nobody
<>will overthrow you in battle. You will be loved by
<>your subjects and they will obey you. You will be well-
<>versed in the knowledge of law and its observance and
<>the learned will recognize your knowledge. You will
<>re-establish caste system in your kingdom.” (Harivam3s4a,
<>1. 31.35.39).
<NI>Sudes2n2a1 was the wife of Bali. The couple had no children.
<>At last they appealed to Di1rghatamas a hermit, from
<>whom they got five sons called An3ga, Van3ga, Kalin3ga,
<>Pa1n2d2u and Suhma (Brahma Pura1n2a). In Bha1gavata
<>it is mentioned that he had one more son called
<>Andhra.
<NI>Bali left his body at the end of the Kalpa and entered
<>heaven. Before his death he had divided his kingdom
<>equally among his sons. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 9, Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 92).
<HI>BA1LI. A mighty monkey-king.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Ba1li is the son of Indra. There is a story
<>about the birth of Ba1li as follows:--
<NI>S4i1lavati1 who was devoted to her husband once carried
<>her husband Ugratapas who was a leper, on her shoul-
<>der to the house of a harlot one night. On the way
<>they saw the hermit An2ima1n2d2avya, who had been
<>placed on a trident by the order of the King, beating
<>his limbs with agony. Lying on the trident he saw
<>Ugratapas. Seeing the amorous nature of Ugratapas
<>An2ima1n2d2avya cursed him that before sunrise he would
<>die. S4i1lavati1 who was a woman of great purity and
<>loyalty hearing the curse said, “Let the Sun not rise
<>tomorrow.”
<NI>Next day, though it was time the sun did not rise. The
<>night prolonged. Arun2a the charioteer was ready at the
<>usual time but saw the Sun sitting motionless. Wast-
<>ing time was intolerable to the charioteer. So he decid-
<>ed to make the best use of the time at his disposal by
<>witnessing a little of the dance of the celestial beauties
<>in the realm of the devas. But males had no admittance
<>there. So Arun2a took the shape of a beautiful woman
<>and got in. Seeing a new person, very beautiful to
<>look at, sitting in the midst of the celestial maids Indra
<>grew amorous. He secretly took her to a dark place
<>and a son was born out of that coition. That son is Ba1li.
<>When Arun2a returned the Sun was standing full of
<>anger. Being afraid of him Arun2a confessed everything
<>to the Sun. When he heard the whole story the Sun
<>expressed his desire to see that figure which Arun2a had
<>adopted. Accordingly Arun2a again became a woman.
<>The Sun also had coition with her and Sugri1va was
<>the son born out of this coition. Ba1li and Sugri1va
<>were brought up by Ahalya1devi1 in the hermitage of
<>Gautama.
<NI>At that time a monkey-king named R2ks2ara1ja had been
<>ruling over the forest with Kis2kindha as his capital.
<>He had no sons and so he approached Indra and placed
<>before him his grievances. Indra brought Ba1li and [Page105-b+ 65]
<>Sugri1va from the hermitage of Gautama and handed
<>them over to R2ks2arajas. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 107;
<>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 42; Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a
<>and Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>2) {%Marriage and Kingship.%} Owing to difference of opini-
<>on, Ba1li defeated the asuras who came for the churning
<>of the Sea of Milk. The devas who were pleased at
<>this, gave Ba1li, a woman named Ta1ra1, derived from
<>the Sea of Milk. Thus Ta1ra1 became his wife and he got
<>a son by her, named An3gada who became famous as a
<>mighty warrior-prince. Sugri1va married Ruma1. At that
<>time R2ks2ara1ja died and Ba1li became King. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>3) {%Enmity with Hanu1ma1n.%} It was during this period
<>that Hanuma1n was born. While S4iva and Pa1rvati1 were
<>living in the forest as monkeys Pa1rvati1 got with child.
<>The child was given to Bhagava1n Va1yu (Wind-God)
<>with the womb. Va1yu placed the womb with the child
<>in An5jana1 Devi1's stomach. Na1rada informed Ba1li all these
<>things. Ba1li thought that his position would be lost, if
<>a being born of S4iva, grew up in the form of a monkey.
<>In accordance with the advice of Na1rada, Ba1li melted
<>Pan5caloha (Five metals) and passed it into the womb
<>of An5jana1. Still the child in the womb was not killed
<>as it was the sperm of S4iva. The molten metals became
<>earrings of the child in the womb. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Sugri1va separated.%} Once, the son of Maya, the car-
<>penter of the asuras, wanted to defeat Ba1li by a
<>combat or cunning sleights as he was an expert wrest-
<>ler and magician. He came to Kis2kindha1 in the mid-
<>night and standing before the palace, challenged Ba1li,
<>who getting angry came out followed by Sugri1va. See-
<>ing the two of them the magician began to run. Ba1li
<>and Sugri1va chased him to a cave. Placing Sugri1va at
<>the mouth of the cave Ba1li followed the magician. Be-
<>fore going, Ba1li said to Sugri1va: “Brother, I will go in
<>and kill the Magician and return. Be brave and stay
<>here. If the asura dies milk will appear at the mouth
<>of the cave and if he kills me blood will be seen. If the
<>latter happens close the mouth of the cave firmly and
<>return to Kis2kindha1 and live happily there.”
<NI>Ba1li did not return even after a year. Finally the asura
<>was killed. But by the cunning sleights of the magician
<>it was blood that appeared at the mouth of the cave.
<>Thinking that his brother was slain by the magician
<>Sugri1va felt sorry. Then he closed the mouth of the cave
<>firmly with stone and returned to Kis2ki1ndha1. Hearing
<>about the death of Ba1li the monkeys anointed Sugri1va
<>as King. After a time Ba1li returned stronger than before
<>and saw the mouth of the cave closed. He thought that
<>Sugri1va had closed the mouth of the cave deliberately
<>to kill him and to usurp his throne. Ba1li reached
<>Kis2kindha1 and drove Sugri1va away. S4ugri1va fled to
<>Mount R2s4yamu1ka1cala which was prohibited area for
<>Ba1li due to a curse. Ma1tan3ga had cursed him that if
<>he entered that mountain his head would be broken.
<>So Sugri1va was safe in that mountain.
<NI>The desire of Ba1li to take revenge on Sugri1va increased
<>everyday. Everyday he used to go to the four sea-
<>shores and conduct bath, prayer, meditation etc. and
<>return to Kis2kindha1 within a short time. With one
<>jump he will reach one place from another, and in
<>each jump he would put one step on the head of
<>Sugri1va in the R2s4yamu1ka1cala. Hanuma1n was the [Page106-a+ 65]
<>minister of Sugri1va. He was much annoyed at this
<>habitual torture of Sugri1va. One day as usual Ba1li
<>was stepping on the head of Sugri1va to jump to another
<>place, when Hanuma1n caught hold of Ba1li by his waist.
<>Hanuma1n thought that if Ba1li was dragged down on
<>the mountain somehow or other, his head would break
<>and there would be an end of his wicked deeds. Ba1li
<>thought that if he could jump into Kis2kindha1 with
<>Hanuma1n it would be easy for him to destroy Sugri1va.
<>But both were of equal strength. So Ba1li1 did not jump
<>with Hanuma1n to Kis2kindha1 and Hanuma1n did not
<>drag Ba1li to the ground. Both did not know how to
<>stop the fight. At last they made a treaty. Ba1li agreed
<>to stop torturing Sugri1va and Hanuma1n agreed not to
<>cause any trouble to Ba1li. Both returned to their own
<>places. After that Sugri1va lived in R2s4yamu1ka1cala with
<>his ministers and Ba1li in Kis2kindha1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 10; Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Pu1rvaka1n2d2a).
<NI>5) Ba1li was cursed by Ma1tan3ga the great hermit. See
<>the word Dundubhi para 4.
<NI>6) {%Defeating Ra1van2a.%} Ba1li had got a boon from the
<>Gods that he would get half the strength of his oppo-
<>nent who stood face to face with him in fight. This
<>power enabled Ba1li to defeat all his foes and bring the
<>countries in all directions under his sway. Ra1van2a heard
<>about this and decided to overpower Ba1li somehow or
<>other and approached Kis2kindha1. Ba1li knew this. His
<>minister, Ta1ran, went to Ra1van2a and told him about
<>the power of Ba1li and of the boon by which Ba1li got
<>half the strength of his opponent. When Ra1van2a heard
<>of this peculiar boon he decided to kill Ba1li. His idea
<>was to kill Ba1li by going behind him when he went to
<>the sea-shore to take bath in the morning.
<NI>Next morning Ba1li went to the eastern sea-shore and
<>began his prayer and meditation. Ra1van2a approached
<>Ba1li from behind and sat close to him. Perhaps the
<>idea of Ra1van2a might have been to take Ba1li by his
<>tail and beat him on the ground. Ba1li knew that
<>Ra1van2a was sitting behind him. But pretending that
<>he knew nothing put his long tail on the body of
<>Ra1van2a, and passed it lengthwise and breadthwise
<>through every part of his body and tied him like a
<>bundle of faggots, and made a jump into the air.
<>Within a short time he visited all the usual places and
<>reached Kis2kindha1. Seeing Ra1van2a hanging by the
<>tail of Ba1li, even the women folk laughed. Thus
<>Ra1van2a admitted defeat. Ba1li let him go unhurt.
<>(Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>7) {%Death.%} After Si1ta1 had been stolen away Ra1ma
<>and Laks2man2a wandered about in the forest. Then
<>they met with Hanuma1n, who took them to his King
<>Sugri1va. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va entered into a treaty,
<>by which S4ri1 Ra1ma was to kill Ba1li and to restore to
<>Sugri1va his wife who was under the custody of Ba1li, and
<>to make him the King of Kis2kindha1, in return for
<>which Sugri1va and his men had to help S4ri1 Ra1ma to
<>find out and recover Si1ta1. In accordance with the con-
<>ditions of the treaty, S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va reached
<>Kis2kindha1, to confront with Ba1li. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sug-
<>ri1va had hit up on a plan, by which S4ri1 Ra1ma was to
<>shoot Ba1li down, when Sugri1va was engaged in boxing
<>with Ba1li. Sugri1va challenged Ba1li to a single combat.
<>Ba1li came out and a horrible boxing began between the
<>two. But Sri1 Ra1ma could not distinguish one from [Page106-b+ 64]
<>the other. Thier faces were so alike. Sugri1va, being
<>defeated, receded from fight. S4ri1 Ra1ma and Sugri1va
<>returned to R2s4yamu1ka1cala. Surgi1va spoke ill of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. But S4ri1 Ra1ma revealed the truth, and Sugri1va
<>believed it. Next day morning both of them started for
<>Kis2kindha1 to kill Ba1li. S4ri1 Ra1ma had put a flower
<>garland around the neck of Sugri1va to distinguish him
<>from Ba1li. This time Ta1ra1 tried to the utmost to dis-
<>suade Ba1li from fighting. But without paying any heed
<>to her words Ba1li engaged Sugri1va in fighting. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma, sitting in ambush, instantly sent an arrow to
<>the breast of Ba1li who looked to the side from which
<>the arrow came. Before falling down, looking at S4ri1
<>Ra1ma Ba1li said “It is not right on the part of the King
<>of Ayodhya1 to have shot an arrow from ambush”.
<>Hearing that S4ri1 Ra1ma said, “If you see me face to face
<>you will become devoted to me. It is not right to kill
<>one's devotee. You are a friend of Ra1van2a, who as you
<>know, is my foe. If I let you alone Ra1van2a is likely to
<>get your help. Besides, you have a boon that you will
<>get half the strength of the foe who faces you, and as
<>such you cannot be killed by anybody in direct fight.
<>It is unavoidable for the safety of Sugri1va, for my
<>interest, for the protection of the world at large, and
<>for the preservation of law and order that you should
<>be killed. Was it not a violation of duty on your part
<>to steal the wife of Sugri1va?”
<NI>Ba1li fell down. Immediately Ta1ra1devi1 and An3gada
<>arrived there. Ta1ra1 spoke very harsh words to S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. At last Ba1li entrusted Ta1ra1 and An3gada with
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma and then he died. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Kis2kindha1ka1n2d2a).
<HI>BALI1HAM3. A dynasty of Ks2atriyas. It is mentioned in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74, Stanza 14
<>that there was a king named Arkaja in this dynasty.
<HI>BA1LIS4IKHA. A serpent born to Kas4yapa praja1pati
<>of his wife Kadru. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 35,
<>Stanza 8).
<HI>BALIVA1K. A hermit. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Stanza 14 that this hermit
<>had been a member of the durbar of Yudhis2t2hira.
<HI>BALLA1LA. Son of a Vais4ya named Kalya1n2a. From
<>childhood Balla1la was an ardent devotee of Gan2apati.
<>When he was a child he used to gather pebbles and
<>make a heap and then worship it, imagining it to be
<>Gan2es4a (Gan2apati).
<NI>His parents did not like this. They tried their best to
<>dissuade him from this habit. Once they tied him to
<>a tree and gave him severe cuts. But their attempts
<>were futile. One day an image of Gan2apati arose in
<>the place where the child used to worship. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a 1:2).
<HI>BALLAVA (VALLAVA). A country in Bha1rata. Men-
<>tion is made about this country in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9.
<HI>BALLAVA (VALLAVA). This is the pseudo-name
<>assumed by Bhi1masena, while the Pa1n2d2avas were living
<>in pseudonymity in the kingdom of Vira1t2a. In some
<>Pura1n2as this name is shown as ‘Valala’. (M.B., Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 2, Stanza 1).
<HI>BALOTKAT2A1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya.
<>(M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 23).
<HI>BALVALA (VALKALA). An asura. This asura had
<>been tormenting the hermits of the forest of Naimis4a. [Page107-a+ 64]
<>This asura was killed by Balabhadrara1ma.
<F>*) In the original of Bha1gavata this name is given as Balvala. But in the Malayalam translation the name used is “Valkala”.</F> For
<>detailed story see para 6 of the word Balabhadra-
<>ra1ma.
<HI>BA1N2A (BA1N2ABHAT2T2A) I. A Sanskrit poet who lived in
<>the 7th century A.D. He was a member of the assem-
<>bly of emperor Hars2avardhana. ‘Hars2acarita’ (prose)
<>is the most important work of Ba1n2a. Though many of
<>the descriptions in this book contain exaggerations it
<>affords plenty of scope for investigation into the fea-
<>tures of ancient Sanskrit literature. He has mentioned
<>about Vya1sa, Bhat2t2a1ra-haris4candra, Sa1tava1hana,
<>Pravarasena, Bha1sa, Ka1lida1sa and such others.
<NI>Hars2acarita, in a sense, is a Romance. It is divided
<>into eight Ucchva1sas. From the first two or three
<>chapters informations could be had of Ba1n2abhat2t2a.
<>His mother Ra1jyadevi1 died when he was a little boy.
<>At the age of fourteen his father also died. After that
<>he arrived at the palace of Hars2a. The story of Hars2a-
<>carita begins with the death of Prabha1kara-Vardhana,
<>father of Hars2a. The Book ends with the story incom-
<>plete. Hars2acarita is the only historic prose work
<>available in Sanskrit.
<HI>BA1N2A II. A mighty and powerful Asura.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descended from Maha1vis2n2u in
<>the following order: Brahma1-Mari1ci-Kas4yapa-Hiran2ya-
<>kas4ipu-Pr2ahla1da-Virocana-Maha1bali-Ba1n2a.
<NI>2) {%Getting a boon.%} Ba1n2a began his reign with the city
<>of S4on2itapura as his capital. Then he went to the
<>vicinity of the Hima1layas and began to do penance
<>thinking of S4iva. S4iva made his appearance and asked
<>him what he wanted. He requested that he should be
<>considered as the son of Pa1rvati1 and that he should be
<>given thousand hands so as to destroy all his enemies.
<>S4iva granted him the boon. From that day onwards
<>Pa1rvati1 considered him as the younger brother of
<>Subrahman2ya. He returned to his Kingdom and began
<>to reign.
<NI>3) {%Battle with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his fall.%} (See the word
<>Aniruddha).
<NI>4) {%Other information.%} (1) In the Pura1n2as Ba1n2a1sura is
<>often called by the name Maha1ka1la, which is the name
<>of an attendant of S4iva. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 20).
<NI>(2) S4ukra1ca1rya (the teacher of the Asuras) always
<>worked for the uplift of Ba1n2a. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 38, Stanza 29).
<NI>(3) In the Battle with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Ba1n2a was helped by
<>S4iva, Subrahman2ya, and the Gods like Agni (fire) and
<>others. (M.B., Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<NI>(4) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a cut down the thousand hands of Ba1n2a
<>with his Cakra1yudha (the wheel weapon). (M.B.,
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<NI>(5) Ba1n2a often stood under the cover of the mountain
<>of Kraun5ca and attacked the devas (gods). So once
<>Subrahman2ya had to cut the mountain Kraun5ca with
<>his arrows. (M.B., S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza
<>82).
<HI>BA1N2A III. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. Mention is
<>made about this Ba1n2a in Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 45, Stanza 67.
<NI>BA1N2A IV. An asura. During the regime of S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>this Asura fought against the King and his brothers. A
<>S4ivalin3ga had been consecrated in the throat of this [Page107-b+ 63]
<>asura. So it was not possible for Laks2man2a to defeat
<>him though he had fought with him for so many days.
<>Laks2man2a heard an etherial voice saying, “Unless and
<>until the image of S4ivalin3ga is removed from his throat
<>Ba1n2a could not be killed.” By the operation of arrows
<>Laks2man2a smashed the image of S4ivalin3ga in his
<>throat. With the same arrow he cut the throat of the
<>asura also and thus Ba1n2a was killed. (Kampa Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Uttara Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>BANDHUDA1YA1DA. A son who can claim to be a heir.
<>The Pura1n2as state about six different kinds of Bandhu-

<NI>2) {%Pran2i1ta.%} A son born to one's wife by the blessing
<>of any holy man.
<NI>3) {%Putrika1putra.%} Son of one's daughter.
<NI>4) {%Paunarbhava.%} A son born after a re-marriage.
<NI>5) {%Ka1ni1na.%} A son born before marriage.
<NI>6) {%Bha1n5ja.%} Son of one's sister. All these sons are

<HI>BANDHUMA1N. A king of the country of Videha.
<>(Chapter 6, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).
<HI>BANDHUMATI1. A lady attendant of Va1savadatta1,
<>wife of Udayana. (See {%Va1savadatta1%}).
<HI>BARBARA. A country of pura1n2ic fame. The people
<>living there were called Barbaras. They were consider-
<>ed as low caste people. There is also a statement that
<>these people were born of the sides of the cow, Nan-
<>dini1. (S4loka 37, Chapter 174, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<>During the victory march of the Pa1n2d2avas Bhi1masena
<>conquered the Barbaras. Nakula also conquered these
<>people. (Chapter 32, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.). In the
<>Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a of Dharmaputra the Barbaras were
<>present with gifts.
<HI>BARBARIKA. Son of Maurvi1 born of Ghat2otkaca, son
<>of Bhi1ma. Skanda Pura1n2a gives the following details
<>about him.
<NI>Barbarika was a Yaks2a in his previous life. Once the
<>devas unable to bear the insufferable harm done to
<>them by the Da1navas approached Lord Maha1vis2n2u for
<>help and then the Yaks2a who was present there at that
<>time said with arrogance, “There is no need for Vis2n2u
<>to curb the activities of the Da1navas. I shall do it my-
<>self.” Hearing those arrogant words Brahma1 cursed
<>him saying that in his next life he would be killed by
<>Vis2n2u.
<NI>True to the curse the Yaks2a was born in his next life
<>as Barbarika, son of Ghat2otkaca. To lessen the force of
<>the curse Kr2s2n2a advised him to worship Devi1. At last
<>pleasing the goddess by the kindly help of a brahmin
<>named Vijaya Barbarika killed a demoness called
<>Maha1jihva and a demon of name Repalendra. The
<>bra1hmin further gave him a weapon named Vibhu1ti
<>which could split the vital centres of the body of an
<>enemy and said, “Use this weapon against the Kaura-
<>vas who oppose the Pa1n2d2avas.”
<NI>Once Barbarika defeated his grandfather Bhi1ma in a
<>battle and greatly grieved over the injury done started
<>to commit suicide. Then Devi1 appeared before him and
<>reminded him thus, “You will get salvation only if you
<>are killed by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and so desist from committing
<>suicide.” [Page108-a+ 65]
<NI>The great war started and Barbarika fighting on the
<>side of the Pa1n2d2avas started using his weapon Vibhu1ti.
<>He sent it against all excepting the Pa1n2d2avas, Kr2pa1-
<>ca1rya and As4vattha1ma1. He did not leave even Kr2s2n2a
<>alone and the weapon fell on the feet of Kr2s2n2a also.
<>Enraged at this Kr2s2n2a used his Sudars4ana Cakra and
<>cut off his head; at once Devi1 appeared and brought
<>him to life. After the great battle on the advice of
<>Kr2s2n2a Barbarika went and lived in Guptaks2etra.
<HI>BARHAN2A1S4VA. A king born of the dynasty of emperor
<>Pr2thu. Descending in order: Pr2thu-Vis4varandhi-Candra-
<>Yuvana1s4va-S4a1vanta-Br2hadas4va-Dhundhuma1ra (alias
<>Valaya1s4va)-Dr2d2ha1s4va-Haryas4va-Nikumbha and to
<>Nikum3bha was born Barhan2a1s4va and from him Kr2s4a1s4va-
<>Prasenajit-Yuvana1s4va-Ma1ndha1ta1. (Saptama Skandha,
<>Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>BARHIS. A devagandharva clan. These were born to
<>Kas4yapa praja1pati of his wife Pr2tha1. (Chapter 65, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BARHIS2AD(S). A class of Manes. It is mentioned in
<>Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 20 that some classes of manes
<>such as Agnis2va1ttas, Barhis2ads, Anagnis, and Sa1gnis are
<>said to have derived from Brahma1. Brahma1 created two
<>different sets of Pitr2s, Agnis2va1ttas and Barhis2ads.
<>(Chapter 10, Am3s4am 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>These Barhis2ads who are members of the Yamasabha1 (coun-
<>cil of the God of Death) perform the ma1ntric rites for
<>the dead. The name brings into its fold the world of
<>the seven sacred sages also. (Chapter 208, S4a1nti Parva,
<>M.B.). It was through these Barhis2ads that Brahma1
<>taught Sa1tvatadharma to a brahmin who became well-
<>known later as Jyes2t2ha. (Chapter 34, S4loka 45, S4a1nti

<>he drank up the sea completely dry, and Varun2a shud-
<>dering with fear returned Bhadra1 to Utathya and pro-
<>fusely apologised. Thus ended the problem.
<HI>BHADRA1 VII. Verse 24, Chapter 7 of the Mausala

<>got himself sanctified.
<NI>King Vi1rasena, who was then ruling the Avanti king-
<>dom had earned ample sanctity by the performance of
<>seventeen As4vamedha ya1gas. The Deaths of King
<>Vi1rasena and Bhadraka took place on one and the same
<>day. Though Bhadraka was immoral in his life, he
<>went to heaven along with Vi1rasena after death as he
<>had taken the ma1gha bath. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara-
<>khan2d2a).
<HI>BHADRAKA1LI1. Another form of Pa1rvati1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Lord S4iva, on hearing about the self-
<>immolation in fire of his wife, Sati1 at the famous yajn5a
<>conducted by Daks2a rushed in all anger to the spot, [Page109-b+ 65]
<>and beat the earth with his matted hair, and there ensu-
<>ed two forces called Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1. This
<>Bhadraka1li1 was really Sati1 or Pa1rvati1 in another form.
<NI>2) {%Bhadraka1li1 and Kam3sa.%} There is a story in the Das4ama-
<>Skandha of Bha1gavata that Kam3sa took away from
<>the room in which Devaki1 had delivered S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the
<>child of Yas4oda1 by whom Kr2s2n2a had been replaced,
<>and dashed the child against a rock, and that the
<>child then escaped from his clutches and rose up to the
<>sky. That child was Bhadraka1li1 in another form. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 12).
<NI>3) {%Kampa, Lan3ka1laks2mi1 and Bhadraka1li1.%} Lan3ka1laks2mi1,
<>who was guarding the city of Lan3ka1, was the first to
<>prevent Hanuma1n from entering the city. Tamil
<>Pura1n2as aver that this Lan3ka1laks2mi1 was an incarnation
<>of Bhadraka1li1. Hanuma1n thrashed Lan3ka1laks2mi1 with
<>his left hand at which she vomitted blood and fell down
<>unconscious. On regaining consciousness remembrance
<>of the past occurred to her, and after thanking Hanuma1n,
<>who restored her to her former form, she returned to
<>Kaila1sa. She complained to S4iva that she could not
<>witness the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war. Then S4iva told her
<>thus:
<NI>“You go to the Dra1vid2a country and be put up in the
<>‘Svayambhu1lin3ga’ temple there. I shall be born there
<>as Kampa, compose the Ra1ma1yan2a in Tamil and get
<>conducted the dolls-play. Then you would be able to
<>enjoy the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma, especially the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a
<>war, both by hearing and seeing the same in better
<>manner than by actually seeing the war.
<NI>Bhadraka1li1 acted according to this bidding of S4iva.
<>There lived a great scholar named San3karana1ra1yan2a
<>close to the temple. His wife was Cin3ka1ravalli1. Lord
<>S4iva, as decided upon previously was born as the son
<>of Cin3ka1ravalli1, who had become a widow while she
<>was worshipping ‘Svayambhu1deva’ for the gift of a
<>child. But, Cin3ka1ravalli1, who feared scandal in her,
<>a widow, becoming a mother, forsook the child in the
<>temple precincts and left the place. One Gan2es4akaunta
<>sighted the orphan child, and took it to Jayappavallan,
<>the Kaunta chief. The Kaunta chief, who was without
<>children brought up the orphan child as though it had
<>been his own child. Since the child was recovered from
<>the foot of the flagstaff it was named Kampa. Kampa,
<>who was very intelligent even in his infancy, but lazy by
<>nature turned out to be a great scholar and good poet
<>in Tamil by the time he grew up to be a youth, and
<>he became, consequently a prominent member in the
<>‘poets’ assembly’ of King Cola. When to his name was
<>added the plural suffix ‘r’ as a token of great respect
<>he came to be known as Kampar.
<NI>Once King Cola asked Kampar and Ot2t2akku1tta another
<>member of the poets’ assembly to compose in Tamil
<>poetry the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma. The King's direction was
<>that. Ot2t2akku1tta should compose his poem upto the
<>incident, Setubandhana (building a bridge in the sea up
<>to Lan3ka1) and Kampar should write the story of the
<>war in his poem. Ot2t2akku1tta completed the task allotted
<>to him within six months. But Kampar had not attempt-
<>ed to write even a single line. Having been informed
<>about the matter the King ordered that the poem, Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a should be recited in the assembly the very next
<>day itself. Kampar, who began writing his poem the
<>same day with the object of completing it in the night
<>itself fell asleep without writing anything at all. When [Page110-a+ 65]
<>Kampar awoke early in the morning he saw a divine
<>form disappearing from his room, and exclaimed, “Oh!
<>mother! you have slipped away”. To this the divine
<>form replies, “Oh Kampar! I have finished writing”.
<>And, then the divine form vanished completely.
<NI>When Kampar got completely out of sleep and looked
<>about he found the Ra1ma1yan2a story fully written in
<>verse on his desk. Kampar inferred that the poem was
<>composed by S4a1rada1bhagavati1, the presiding deity of
<>learning and literature, and he was wonder-struck. He
<>recited the poem in the royal assembly, and the King
<>and others too were wonder-struck. And, afterwards,
<>according to the orders of the King the story of the war
<>(Yuddhaka1n2d2a Katha1) began to be exhibited as dolls-
<>play in the presence of the idol of the Devi1 in the
<>temple. Thus S4iva incarnated himself as Kampar,
<>recited the story of the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war in the temple,
<>and hearing it Bhadraka1li1 danced.
<NI>The above is the chief legend about Kampar.
<HI>BHADRAKA1LIPPA1T2T2U. (Pa1t2t2u = Song). Folk song very
<>popular in Kerala temples. The practice is to sing
<>songs in praise of Bhadraka1li1

<HI>BHADRAKARN2ES4VARA(M). A sacred place. He who
<>visits this place conducts worship will never have to
<>face ill fate. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Verse 39).
<HI>BHADRAMATA1 (BHADRAMANA1). Daughter born to

<>daughters of Krodhavas4a1 are: Mr2gi1, Mr2gamanda1,
<>Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rddu1li1, S4veta1, Surabhi,
<>Surasa1 and Kadru. (Sarga 14, A1ran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>BHADRAMATI. A very poor brahmin. This brahmin
<>had six wives and two hundred and fortyfour daughters.
<>(Na1rada Pura1n2am).
<NI>Once, hearing the glory of Bhu1da1na (giving away land
<>free to the deserved) he was much impressed and from
<>then onwards he became filled with a strong desire
<>to give land free to the poor. He had no land of his
<>own. But he went to the king of Kaus4a1mbi1 and begged
<>for some land which when received was immediately
<>given as gift to poor brahmins. After that he went and
<>bathed in the Pa1pana1s4ana ti1rtha situated in the mount
<>of Ven3kat2a1cala. Bhadramati got salvation by this good
<>deed. (Skanda 2,1,10).
<HI>BHADRAS4A1KA. A name of Subrahman2ya. It is the figure
<>of Subrahman2ya in the shape of a goat that is known

<>the Vr2ddhaca1ran2as. By worshipping this tree the
<>men have become white and majestic and by drink-
<>ing a juice prepared from its leaves the women keep
<>themselves eternally young. Chapter seven of Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva says like this about this tree: “Ka1la1mra stands
<>towering miles high bearing flowers and fruits at all
<>times of the year. The Vr2ddhaca1ran2as worshipping it
<>are white, strong and majestic. The women drinking
<>its juice are lotus-complexioned, beautiful, Moonfaced, [Page110-b+ 65]
<>well versed in music and dance and having a life-span of
<>over a thousand years, remaining young all the time.”
<HI>BHADRASA1RA. A king in the region of Ka1s4mi1ra. His
<>only son, Sudharman, was very much devoted to S4iva
<>and spent most of his time worshipping him. The
<>father tried his best to withdraw his son from this ex-
<>cessive devotion but failed.
<NI>Then one day the great sage, Para1s4ara, came to the
<>King as his guest and the King then requested him to
<>make his son withdraw from his S4iva-worship. But
<>Para1s4ara then told him about the previous life of
<>Sudharma1 and consoling him persuaded the King to do
<>the ‘Rudra1bhis2eka’ (uninterrupted pouring of cold
<>water over an idol of S4iva) by himself. The king then
<>entrusted the state with his son and left for the forests
<>accepting an ascetic life. (Skandha Pura1n2a, 3.3.20-21).
<HI>BHADRASENA. A king. Udda1laka Mahars2i performed
<>a demoniac ya1ga to destroy this king. (S4atapatha-
<>bra1hman2a).
<HI>BHADRAS4RAVAS. A king whom the Pura1n2as extol as
<>having ruled Saura1s2t2ra in Dva1parayuga. At the forest
<>of Naimis4a sage Su1ta told the following story to explain
<>how Laks2mi1 (goddess of wealth) took her abode in the
<>houses of men.
<NI>Bhadras4rava1 (Bhadras4ravas) who was ruling Saura1s2t2ra
<>had seven sons and a daughter of his wife Suraticand-
<>rika1. The daughter was named S4ya1maba1la1. Once
<>truthful-S4ya1maba1la1 was sitting under a green-wood tree
<>with her playmates playing with diamonds and gold
<>sand when the goddess of wealth disguised as an aged
<>brahmin woman went to the gates of the palace and asked
<>for permission to see the queen, Suraticandrika1. The
<>sentries pressed for details about her and then she said
<>this: “My name is Kamala1. My husband is a man named
<>Bhuvana1s4va and we live in Dva1raka1. Your queen in her
<>previous birth was a Vais4ya woman. One day she quar-
<>relled with her husband and he beat her hard and then
<>crying loudly she ran out of the house. I met her and
<>when she told me her story I instructed her to observe
<>a Pun2yavrata (Fasting to any particular deity). She did
<>it willingly and as a result she acquired great wealth
<>and happiness.
<NI>One day the husband and wife died. Yama, the king
<>of Death, then sent his orderlies to bring before him
<>that couple who had always quarrelled with each other
<>while living. Bound by ropes the ghastly servants of
<>Yama were about to drag them to their land when the
<>angelic servants of Vis2n2u with the insignia of ‘S4am3kha-
<>Cakra-Gada1’ on their lapels arrived there and those
<>messengers of Laks2mi1 headed by Svapraka1s4a cut off the
<>ropes and carrying them in a Ra1jaham3sa chariot took
<>them through noble paths to the land of Laks2mi1. They
<>lived there happily for a period calculated at the rate of
<>a thousand years for one week of Pun2yavrata observed.
<>In the end to complete the goodness remaining they
<>were born as King and queen on earth with plenty
<>of wealth and happiness. But they have now forgotten
<>about the Pun2yavrata and I have come here to remind
<>them of it.”
<NI>The gate-keeper immediately went to her mistress and
<>told her all that happened. But the queen, Suraticand-
<>rika1 got angry when she heard the story and ordered
<>the old woman to be sent away from there with thrash-
<>es. The old woman ran away from the palace crying
<>loudly and S4ya1maba1la1 on hearing the cry went and [Page111-a+ 65]
<>enquired about the incident. On hearing the story
<>from the woman S4ya1maba1la1 got instructions regarding
<>that Pun2yavrata from the old woman and started
<>observing it. Within four weeks she got married and
<>went to her husband's house. After S4ya1maba1la1's depar-
<>ture from the palace the wealth of the King began to
<>wane and they became so poor that at the request of the
<>queen the King Bhadras4rava1 went to his daughter to ask
<>for help. The daughter gave his father a block of solid
<>gold drapped in a paper. But on his return to the
<>palace when he opened the bundle he found there a
<>block of charcoal instead of gold. On seeing the mis-
<>hap the king burst into a cry.
<NI>Suraticandrika1 then went to her daughter and was well
<>received and attended to. During her stay there the
<>Pun2yavrata day of the month came and the daughter
<>tried her best to make her mother also observe the
<>same. But the poverty-stricken queen broke the fast
<>without her daughter's knowledge by eating what re-
<>mained in the dishes of the children. But the next
<>month S4ya1maba1la1 compelled her mother to observe the
<>fast strictly and so Suraticandrika1 took the Vrata
<>successfully. A few days after that Suraticandrika1 re-
<>turned home and to her amazement found everything
<>in plenty there once more. (Chapter 11, Bhaga 2,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHADRAS4REN2YA. A Hehaya King who was ruling a
<>state with Ma1his2mati1 as capital. He had fought many
<>wars with Divoda1sa, king of Ka1s4i1. (See under Divo-

<>of Rahova1di. Bhadra1s4va1 had ten sons: R2ks2eyu, Kr2s2eyu,
<>Sannateyu, Ghr2teyu, Citeyu, Sthan2d2ileyu, Dharmeyu,
<>Sammiteyu, Kr2teyu and Matina1ra. (Chapter 278, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>Once Agastya went and stayed for seven days in the
<>palace of Bhadra1s4va and his wife Ka1ntimati1. Every-
<>day Agastya used to speak in glowing terms about
<>Ka1ntimati1 and asked about the reason for it he replied:
<>“In her previous birth Ka1ntimati1 was a servant girl in
<>a wealthy house. The master of the house once entrust-
<>ed her with the task of seeing that none of the temple
<>lights went out on the night of Dva1das4i1 in the month
<>of Tula1 (A1s4vina--October). She did her duty so
<>willingly and sincerely that she was born as a queen and
<>you a King”. Then Agastya gave them instructions
<>about that Vrata which both Bhadra1s4va and Ka1ntimati1
<>observed sincerely, receiving as a result benediction
<>from Vis2n2u. (Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHADRA1S4VA II. Agni1dhra, son of Priyavrata and
<>grandson of Manu, got nine sons of his wife Pu1rvacitti,

<NI>One day, while Bhadra1yu was ruling the country, S4iva
<>came in the guise of a tiger and carried away the wife
<>of a brahmin. Bhadra1yu, a firm protector of his sub-
<>jects gave his own wife to the brahmin and prepared
<>himself to give up his life in fire. S4iva greatly pleased
<>at this selfless act of Bhadra1yu befitting a true King
<>appeared before him and blessed him and gave back

<HI>BHAGAVAD GI1TA1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The Bhagavad Gi1ta1 is a poem consisting of
<>650 verses divided into eighteen chapters. The Gi1ta1
<>covers chapters 25-45 in the Bhi1s2ma Parva of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata, and it is in the form of a talk or discussion
<>between Arjuna and Lord Kr2s2n2a. The mighty armies
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas were arrayed on
<>opposite sides for mortal combat on the field of Kuru-
<>ks2etra when Arjuna, overcome by grief at the prospect
<>of fathers, brothers, preceptors and other Kinsmen
<>fighting and killing one another expressed to his
<>charioteer, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a his aversion to fighting. But, the
<>Lord pointed out to the unwilling Arjuna, by unique
<>and various arguments, his imperative duty, under the
<>circumstance, to fight and fight in heroic earnestness with
<>the result that Arjuna shed his disinclination to fight and
<>entered the fray, which ended in the ultimate victory
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. And the dialogue between Arjuna
<>and Kr2s2n2a, and especially the great teaching of Kr2s2n2a
<>on the field form the theme of the Gi1ta1. The Gi1ta1
<>contains three spheres or fields of teaching; the karma
<>yoga (philosophy of action), jn5a1na yoga (philosophy of
<>knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (philosophy of devotion).
<>The three yogas are treated each in six chapters.
<NI>The theme of the Gi1ta1 is philosophy, and it is revered
<>as one of the most sublime philosophical texts of the
<>Hindu religion. Many a great thinker and philosopher
<>like A1ca1rya S4an3kara, Ra1ma1nuja1ca1rya and Madhva1-
<>ca1rya have annotated, and written commentaries on
<>the Gi1ta1. There is a school of thought which believes
<>that the Gi1ta1 was taught to Arjuna by Kr2s2n2a himself
<>on the battle-field in something like tabloid form and
<>that Vya1sa eleborated the mighty teaching in its present
<>form. The poet, Ba1n2a, who flourished in the 7th
<>century A.D., and the great S4an3kara, who lived in the
<>8th century believed that the Gi1ta1 was sung by Kr2s2n2a
<>himself. But there are some modern thinkers, who
<>argue that the Gi1ta1 was composed some time between
<>the third and fourth centuries B.C. and it was inter-
<>polated into the Maha1bha1rata in the second century
<>A.D.
<NI>The Gi1ta1 has translations in all the languages of the
<>world. The whole world has acclaimed it as a very [Page113-a+ 65]
<>weighty and valuable contribution in the sphere of
<>philosophy.
<NI>2) {%Theme of the Gi1ta1.%} It has been mentioned above that
<>the Gi1ta1 forms chapters 25-45 in the Bhi1s2ma Parva of
<>the Maha1bha1rata. The subject-matter of each chapter
<>of the Gi1ta1 is given below.

<NI>(For another story about the greatness of the Gi1ta1
<>see Dus4s4a1sana II).
<HI>BHAGAVATI1. The words Bhagava1n and Bhagavati1
<>mean Parama1tma1 (universal self) and Prakr2ti (Nature [Page113-b+ 65]
<>and its modifications) respectively. Prakr2ti is also
<>called by the name S4akti. The following elucidation
<>once given by Maha1vis2n2u about Bhagava1n and Bhaga-
<>vati1 is greatly illuminating.
<NI>Time, space, atmosphere and the universe (Brah-
<>ma1n2d2am) are, just like Parama1tma1, eternal. This is the
<>truth and reality. Below this eternal Gokula exists
<>Vaikun2t2haloka, which also is, like the former, eternal.
<>Just like this, Prakr2ti, which is a sport to Brahma1 and
<>is also without beginning or end (Sana1tani1) too is
<>eternal. In the same manner as flame exists in fire in-
<>separable from it, moonlight in moon, beauty in the
<>lotus flower and brightness in the sun, so does nature
<>exist in soul inseparable therefrom. In the same way
<>as the goldsmith cannot make gold ornaments without
<>gold and the potter cannot make pots without clay, the
<>Parama1tma1 will not in the least be able to function
<>unaided by Prakr2ti. Prakr2ti (Nature, Devi1) is all power-
<>ful. ‘Para’ becomes powerful enough to do everything
<>when he joins the Devi1.
<NI>The sound ‘S4a’ means welfare and good fortune, and
<>the sound ‘kti’ means prowess. Hence “S4akti” means
<>the embodiment of welfare and prowess or she, who is
<>the giver of welfare and prowess. Bhagavati1 combines
<>in herself knowledge, affluence, riches, fame and strength.
<>As the Parama1tma1 is always with and inseparable from
<>such Bhagavati1 he is called Bhagava1n also. When
<>Prakr2ti and Parama1tma1 remain combined it is called
<>Parabrahma, which possesses neither form nor attri-
<>butes. And, when Prakr2ti and Purus2a separate, of their
<>own accord, they assume forms and attributes.
<NI>The above is S4aiva doctrine in a nut-shell. The
<>Vais2n2avas do not accept this position. They ask, “How
<>is it possible to have brightness or effulgence without
<>there being an effulgent one?” Therefore, the Vais2n2avas
<>believe in the existence, at the centre of an effulgent
<>sphere, of a thing possessing the utmost effulgence and
<>brightness equal to that of Brahma1. This ‘thing’--
<>Deva--is very efficient and effective to remedy sorrows
<>due to birth, death, disease etc. and to him the life-
<>time of Brahma is just one minute only. This Deva is
<>called Parama1tma1, Parabrahma and Kr2s2n2a by the
<>Vais2n2avas. ‘Kr2s2’ means maximum devotion (love)
<>towards Parama1tma1, and ‘n2a’ means he who becomes
<>slave to such devotion. Hence Kr2s2n2a means he who
<>becomes a slave to the love of his devotees. There is
<>another meaning also for the word Kr2s2n2a. Kr2s2 means
<>all and ‘n2a’ means seed or root; and thus Kr2s2n2a means
<>he, who is the root of everything. In the very begin-
<>ning there was only this Kr2s2n2a; and this Lord, sub-
<>ject only to his own will and pleasure, divided him-
<>self into two, the left side becoming woman and the
<>right side man. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>BHAGINI. A word used in addressing women. Verse
<>129 in chapter two of the Manusmr2ti lays down that
<>the wife of another person and women who are not
<>one's relatives should be addressed either as Bhavati,
<>Subhage or Bhagini.

<NI>2) {%Recluse.%} Many years had not lapsed after his coro-
<>nation as King when, in the heart of Bhagi1ratha spiri-
<>tual thoughts began to crop up. A great sage called
<>Tritula was his guru. Once Bhagi1ratha asked the guru
<>what was the means to get rid of worldiy sorrows, and
<>the guru replied as follows:--
<NI>The ego will be annihilated when the tendencies and
<>cravings towards objects of the senses are absolutely
<>suppressed and the whole and perfect truth is realised
<>through knowledge, the practice of concentration etc.
<>The ego will not disappear as long as one does not
<>become one's real self by completely overcoming the
<>sense of pride, shame etc. which form the outer case
<>of worldly life. The egoless state is the ultimate
<>achievement and most supreme state. Oh! Bhagi1ratha!
<>if you would get rid of sentiments like pride etc., give
<>up all attachment to material objects, become fearless
<>and gift away, with thoughts concentrated on the inner
<>self, all your wealth to enemies, and then move among
<>those enemies, without any sense of ego and pride
<>about this material body, and take alms from them
<>(enemies) and also give up me, who am your preceptor
<>in the matter of knowledge; then you will become the
<>most sublime Brahma”. This advice of the guru
<>affected him so much that Bhagi1ratha, holding his
<>duties firmly in mind, engaged himself in spiritual
<>practices, and after spending some time thus he per-
<>formed, according to rules, the Agnis2t2oma yajn5a aimed
<>at gifting away everything. All wealth like cows, land,
<>horses, gold etc. were distributed in gifts to noble
<>brahmins and the poor folk according to their eligibi-
<>lity for the same. Within three days he had gifted away
<>everything except the clothes he was wearing. And,
<>then he invited his neighbouring enemy king and gave
<>to him, without the least hesitation, the kingdom which
<>had been bereft of all wealth. The ministers and other
<>citizens felt very sorry about the whole thing. But, Bha-
<>gi1ratha left the country at once for other places having
<>with him only the clothes he was wearing. He spent his
<>days in various places and forests where he was not
<>known even by name. Ere long, Bhagi1ratha attained
<>ultimate spiritual solace. And, then he accidentally
<>came to his former kingdom, which was then being
<>ruled by the enemy King. The ministers and other
<>citizens to whose houses he went begging for alms
<>recognised him, and with sorrow unbearable they
<>appealed to him to accept the throne again and rule
<>the country. Bhagi1ratha rejected their request, and,
<>after staying there for some time, he started for other
<>places. During this wandering of his he met his old
<>preceptor, Tritula, and both of them, in company,
<>toured for some time cities and forests. They felt it very
<>painful to keep on to their body like that. They
<>thought like this: “Why should the body be kept like
<>this. What if this material object continues to exist
<>or perishes? But let it (the body) continue as long as
<>it exists without in any way being against the order
<>of things and ethical practices”. And, in this frame of
<>mind they traversed the forests. Now, the minister of
<>a distant kingdom who was on the look out for a [Page114-b+ 61]
<>successor to the King who had died heirless, persuaded
<>Bhagi1ratha to accept the Kingship of that country. The
<>ministers of Bhagi1ratha's former Kingdom also now
<>requested him to resume his old kingship, especially
<>since its new ruler had already expired. Bhagi1ratha
<>obliged them, and became once again King of his own
<>country. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ham).
<NI>3) {%Bhagi1rathaprayatnam. (Hima1layan or Herculean effort).%}
<>Sagara, an old predecessor of Bhagi1ratha had two
<>wives called Kes4ini1 and Sumati. Kes4ini1 had one son
<>named Asaman5jas and Sumati 60,000 sons. Sagara
<>once conducted an As4vamedha yajn5a in the Indo-
<>Gangetic plane, when Indra stole away the sacrificial
<>horse and kept it quite near to sage Kapila who was
<>doing tapas in Pa1ta1la. The 60,000 sons of Sagara set
<>out in search of the horse and found it out in Pa1ta1la.
<>At the sight of the horse they shouted themselves
<>hoarse. Enraged at this sage Kapila reduced those sons
<>of Sagara to ashes in the fire which emanated from his
<>eyes.
<NI>After entrusting Asaman5jas with the duty of perform-
<>ing the funeral rites of his 60,000 sons Sagara expired.
<>Asaman5jas transferred that duty on to Am3s4uma1n, and
<>he to Bhagi1ratha. Bhagi1ratha did penance on the sea-
<>shore concentrating his mind on Gan3ga1devi1. The Devi1
<>appeared before Bhagi1ratha and asked him to choose
<>what boon he would, and he requested the Devi1 to per-
<>form the funeral rites of 60,000 sons of Sagara remain-
<>ing in the form of ashes in Pa1ta1la. To this Gan3ga1devi1
<>replied that the earth will not be able to withstand
<>the impact of her powerful flow, but she shall, if S4iva
<>permits, flow into his matted hair. And, Gan3ga1devi1
<>asked Bhagi1ratha to first get that permission. This did
<>not dishearten Bhagi1ratha, who went to mount Kaila1sa
<>to do penance so that S4iva might grant him his prayer.
<>He thus did penance for 1000 years. S4iva appeared to
<>him and agreed to receive the rushing flow of Gan3ga1
<>water on his matted head. And, accordingly S4iva stood
<>in position to receive the rushing waters of Gan3ga1, and
<>Gan3ga1 flowed on to his head. Even the most powerful
<>flow of Gan3ga1 water on his head did not cause S4iva to
<>move from his position even by a hair's breadth. This
<>awakened the conceit in Gan3ga1devi1, understanding
<>which S4iva contained her on his head. Without finding
<>any outlet the waters of river Gan3ga1 flowed along the
<>matted hairs of S4iva for thousand years. So, Bhagi-
<>ratha had once again to please S4iva. Thus pleased
<>again S4iva shook his matted head and one drop of
<>water fell on the ground, and that is the river Ganges
<>in North India. The Gan3ga1 flowed along plane ground
<>to Pa1ta1la and performed the funeral rites of Sagara's
<>sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 108; Va1lmi1ki

<HI>BHAIRAVA I. A na1ga belonging to the Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>Vam3s4a. There is a reference to this na1ga in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 51, Verse 17. He was
<>burnt up at the Sarpasatra performed by King Janame-
<>jaya.
<HI>BHAIRAVA II. A Pa1rs2ada of S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Immediately after his birth, this terrible
<>monster subdued all the Devas without getting the
<>permission of S4iva. Enraged at it, S4iva turned him into
<>a tree by a curse. But S4iva was soon pacified and lifted
<>the curse by declaring that those who offered pu1ja1 to
<>the gods would get the full reward for their worship
<>only if they offered pu1ja1 to Bhairava also.
<NI>Bhairava became a tree as soon as he was cursed. He
<>became a tree because he subdued the gods. Therefore
<>that tree came to be called “DAMANAKA” tree
<>(Damana = Subdue). It has another name. “TA1TIRI”
<>tree. Even now, pious people offer pu1ja1 to this tree.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapters 52-80).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Once Brahma1 and Vis2n2u became swollen
<>with pride. In his haughty way, Brahma1 insulted S4iva.
<>Under the insult, S4iva was infuriated and out of the
<>fire of his fury was born Bhairava with his black form.
<>(Lin3ga Pura1n2a 1.90).
<NI>3) {%Brahmahatya1.%} As soon as he was born, Bhairava
<>rushed towards Brahma1 and pinched off his fifth head
<>which had insulted S4iva. By this, he incurred the sin
<>of Brahmahatya1. For the expiation of this sin, as
<>ordered by S4iva, Bhairava started on a journey to go
<>abegging, with Brahma1's severed head in his hand.
<>S4iva then created a woman named “Brahmahatya1”
<>and asked her to follow Bhairava.
<NI>Although Bhairava visited many holy places, he was
<>not able to liberate himself from the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1. At last, at the suggestion of S4iva, he went to
<>Va1ra1n2asi1 and washed off his sin. Brahma1's head which
<>he carried, was also deposited there and the place be-
<>came famous under the name of “Kapa1lamocana
<>ti1rtha”. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4atarudra Sam3hita1).
<NI>4) {%Family.%} In Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a there is an elaborate
<>account of the family of Bhairava. According to this
<>Pura1n2a, Vijaya, the reputed King of Va1ra1n2asi1 was born
<>in the family of Bhairava. Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a also says
<>that Vijaya destroyed the Kha1n2d2avi1 city and set up
<>the Kha1n2d2ava forest in its place.
<NI>According to Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a, Bhairava and Veta1la
<>were, in their previous births, two S4ivapa1rs2adas named
<>Maha1ka1la and Bhr2n3gi. It was by the curse of Pa1rvati1. [Page115-b+ 64]
<>that they were born as mortals in their next birth.
<>(Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a 53).
<NI>The Pura1n2as mention eight Bhairavas called Asita1m3ga,
<>Ruru, Can2d2a, Krodha, Unmatta, Kapa1li, Bhi1s2an2a and
<>Sam3ha1ra.
<NI>5) {%Shape.%} Bhairava has a terrible shape. He wears the
<>crescent moon and plaited hair on his head. His wea-
<>pons are, sword, arrow, dagger, bow, trident, rope
<>etc. At times he is dressed in elephant-skin. He has
<>five faces. Serpents are his ornaments. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapters 52-80).
<HI>BHAIRAVI1. One of the eight Ambas. They are:
<>Rudra1rcika1, Rudracan2d2i1, Nat2es4vari1, Maha1laks2mi1,
<>Siddhaca1mun2d2ika1, Siddhayoges4vari1, Bhairavi1 and
<>Ru1pavidya1. All these are the eight different forms of
<>Devi1. (See the word DEVI1).
<HI>BHAJAMA1NA. A Ya1dava King, whose father was Sat-
<>vata and mother Kausalya1, and they had, beside
<>Bhajama1na, another son called Satvata or Andhaka.

<>named Ba1hyaka1 and Upaba1hyaka1 by whom he got six
<>sons. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>BHAJYA. An a1ca1rya in the line of the R2k disciples of
<>Vya1sa. Bhajya studied Va1lakhilyasam3hita1 at the feet of
<>his guru Ba1s2kali. (Bha1gavata, Dva1das4a Skandha).
<HI>BHAKS2AKA. A S4u1dra sinner. In Padma Pura1n2a the
<>following story is related about this S4u1dra.
<NI>Bhaks2aka who was once going aimlessly somewhere
<>felt extremely thirsty, and quenched his thirst by
<>drinking water which was found near the small plat-
<>form raised for the holy Tulasi1 shrub. The sanctity of
<>the water thus drunk washed away all the sin attached
<>to him. Some time later he was killed by a forest-
<>dweller, and he attained svargaloka (heaven). Bhaks2aka,
<>in his previous birth, was a king who led a voluptuous
<>life, and he, once, robbed a very beautiful woman of
<>her chastity, and it was as a punishment for the sin
<>that the King had to be born, in the next birth, in the
<>womb of a S4u1dra woman. (Padma Pura1n2a, Brahma
<>Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 22).
<HI>BHAKTI. A Devi1 born in Dra1vid2a des4a (Southern
<>India). Once Devi1, along with her two sons, Jn5a1na
<>and Vaira1gya, started on a walking tour to Gokula and
<>Vr2nda1vana via Karn2a1t2aka, Maha1ra1s2t2ra and Gurjara
<>(Gujarat). During the long tour the mother and her
<>sons became aged. But, as soon as they set foot on
<>Gokula and Vr2nda1vana old age quitted Bhakti and
<>she became young again. But, her sons remained old.
<>So the mother requested Na1rada to turn them young
<>again. Na1rada read out to them the Vedas, the
<>Veda1nta (Upanis2ads) and the Bhagavad Gi1ta1, all to no
<>purpose. Bhakti's sons still remained old. Then Sanaka,
<>Sananda and Sanatkuma1ra asked Na1rada to read out
<>the Bha1gavata to them. Na1rada did so, and the sons of
<>Bhakti1 Devi1 became young again. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHALANDANA. A king. Though by birth he was a
<>brahmin he became a Vais4ya because of doing things
<>belonging to the Vais4ya community like trade and
<>commerce. (Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a). According to the
<>Bha1gavata, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a and Va1yu Pura1n2a Bhalan-
<>dana was the son of Na1bha1ga.
<HI>BHALLA1TA. A king of the line of Bharata. He was the
<>son of King Vis4vaksena and father of King Br2hadas4va.
<>(Navama Skandha, Bha1gavata). [Page116-a+ 58]
<HI>BHALLA1T2A(M). A place of habitation in ancient India.
<>Bhi1masena conquered this Iand during his victory march.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 30, Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHA1LUKI I. A R2s2i, who was a member of Yudhis2t2hi-
<>ra's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 15).
<HI>BHA1LUKI II. A mahars2i. He also accompanied the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to Dvaitavana. (Vana Parva, Chapter 27).
<HI>BHA1LUKI III. An a1ca1rya. He was a disciple of La1n3gali,
<>a member of the Sa1ma line of disciples of Vya1sa.
<>(Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHA1MAHA. A critic who lived in the sixth century A.D.
<>He was one of the top critics in the Sanskrit language.
<>His important work is ‘Ka1vya1lam3ka1ra’. This is also
<>called Bha1maha1lam3ka1ra by a few. There are six chapters
<>in this. The first chapter deals with Ka1vyas4ari1ra, the
<>second and third with Alam3ka1ra, the fourth with Ka1vya-
<>dos2a the fifth with Nya1ya and the sixth with S4abdas4ud-
<>dhi. As against Dan2d2i1 Bha1maha separates ‘Katha1’ from
<>‘A1khya1yika1’. According to him the requisites of a good
<>Ka1vya are sweetness, pleasantness and liveliness. Dan2d2i1
<>prescribes ten attributes for a good Ka1vya. Bha1maha is
<>of opinion that Vakrokti is no alam3ka1ra at all. In
<>a wider sense it is ‘atis4ayokti’ (exaggeration). But
<>Bha1maha admits it has a place in Ka1vya.
<HI>BHA1MINI1. Wife of Aviks2it, King of Vais4a1li. The
<>famous Marutta is the son born to this couple. The
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a states that Bha1mini1 once went to
<>Na1galoka to give refuge to the serpents there.
<HI>BHA1NAVI1. A river. S4ri Ra1ma and Laks2man2a on their
<>way to the forests from Citraku1t2a crossed this river,
<>Bha1navi1. (Sarga 52, Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a).
<HI>BHA1N2D2A1YANI. A mahars2i. This sage sits in Devaloka
<>and worships Indra. (S4loka 12, Chapter 7, Sabha1 Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>BHA1N2D2I1RA(M). An ancient forest. It was in this
<>forest situated in Am3ba1d2i that S4ri Kr2s2n2a with his cow-
<>herd chums conducted his childhood exploits. There
<>was a very huge tree of name Bha1n2d2i1ra in this forest
<>and it was under this great tree that Kr2s2n2a and his
<>friends met daily for their play. This forest is on the
<>northern bank of Gan3ga1 in front of Kes4ighat2t2a in
<>Vr2nda1vana. The Pura1n2as proclaim that it was here that

<>refer to para 42 under ‘Indra’.
<HI>BHA1NU I. A son born to Kr2s2n2a of Satyabha1ma1. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).

<>the Ya1davas. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a went with his retinue of
<>Ya1davas to visit the holy palace called Pin2d2a1raka the
<>Ya1davas conducted a wine festival. During that festi-
<>val a demon of the name Nikumbha carried away
<>Bha1numati1. This was because of a curse to Bha1numati1
<>from Durva1sas whom Bha1numati1 did not respect once
<>when they met at the garden of Raivata. Durva1sas had
<>after the curse consoled her by assuring her that she
<>would be saved and married by Sahadeva, one of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. True to this, Bha1numati1 was married to Saha-
<>deva in the presence of Na1rada and Kr2s2n2a. (Vis2n2u

<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA I. Another name of Di1rghatamas.
<F>**) Di1rghatamas is also called Bharadva1ja. But the Bharadva1ja of pura1n2ic fame is not Di1rghatamas. Di1rghatamas is the son whom
<>Br2haspati illegitimately got of Mamata1, his brother's wife. There was then another legitimate child in the womb of Mamata1. Knowing this
<>the devas told her ‘Bharadva1ja’ meaning ‘bear the brunt of two’ and so the son of Br2haspati got the name of Bharadva1ja also. The real
<>name of this son was Di1rghatamas or Vitatha. Di1rghatamas is not the Bharadva1ja who was the father of Dron2a. The famous Bharadva1ja
<>was the son of Atri. Di1rghatamas or Vitatha was the adopted son of Bharata, son of Dus2yanta. (Bha1gavata and Kampara1ma1yan2a. For
<>details see under Bharata I and Di1rghatamas.</F> [Page117-a+ 65]

<>Ra1ma1yan2a states that this sage was the son of Atri
<>Mahars2i. He lived for many thousands of years. He is
<>connected with Va1lmi1ki and the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>Bharadva1ja was for many years a disciple of Va1lmi1ki.
<>He was present with Va1lmi1ki when the hunter killed
<>one of the couple of Kraun5ca. When Va1lmi1ki and
<>Bharadva1ja reached the shores of the river, Tamasa1,
<>that day Va1lmi1ki told Bharadva1ja thus: “Look, Bhara-
<>dva1ja, what a clean ghat this is. The water is pure and
<>clear. Place your water-jug here and give me my
<>valkala. We will get down here in this sacred water”.
<>Then Va1lmi1ki taking the valkala from the disciple
<>walked along the shore admiring the beauty of the
<>forest trees and found on his way the historic Kraun5ca
<>couple. (Sarga 2, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Bharadva1ja and the study of Vedas.%} Bharadva1ja gave
<>himself untiringly to the study of the Vedas. He obtain-
<>ed from Indra a boon to extend his term of life on
<>earth to many thousands of years by different stages,
<>each stage covering a span of a thousand years of life.
<>All these years he devoted to an incessant study of the
<>Vedas. Finding the term not sufficient for completing
<>the study of the Vedas he appealed to Indra again for
<>extension and Indra appearing in person took him before
<>three mountains and giving him three handfuls of
<>sand told him thus, “What you have studied about
<>Vedas till this time is equivalent to the amount of
<>sand I have now given and what is yet to be studied
<>about the Vedas is as big as the three mountains before
<>you”. Any other mortal being would have been dis-
<>heartened by this revelation made by Indra, but not
<>Bharadva1ja. Undaunted he continued his studies. (Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>3) {%Bharadva1ja in the role of a magician.%} The a1s4rama of
<>Bharadva1ja was in Citraku1t2a and S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the beginning of their exile went to his
<>a1s4rama accepting his blessings. Bharata on his return
<>from Kekaya knew about the exile of his brothers and
<>hoping to bring them back to Ayodhya1 went in search
<>of them with a big retinue of soldiers and men. Keeping
<>the retinue outside, Bharata went to the a1s4rama of
<>Bharadva1ja. The latter decided to give Bharata and his
<>people a grand reception and calling Vis4vakarma1 to his
<>side asked him to arrange a royal banquet that night.
<>Devas, Gandharvas, Apsarases, As2t2adikpa1las and all
<>such people were invited for the night. Renowned dancers
<>from devaloka like Ghr2ta1ci1, Hema1, Vis4va1ci1 Mis4rakes4i1 and
<>Alambus2a1 appeared for entertainment. Even Vanara1ji1
<>took part in the dance. Dishes of food came to the
<>guests of their own accord. The night came to an end
<>wonderfully and at daybreak everything vanished and
<>all were amazed at the magic of the sage. (Sarga 91,
<>Ayodhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%Dron2a's origin.%} Dron2a was the son born to Bhara-
<>dva1ja of the celestial woman, Ghr2ta1ci1. (see under
<>Dron2a).
<NI>5) {%How Bharadva1ja died once but was born again.%} See under
<>Arva1vasu.
<NI>6) {%The name Bharadva1ja.%} This is how the connotation of
<>the word is explained.

<>missile. (S4loka 35, Chapter 196, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(11) Once Bhr2gu Mahars2i asked him some questions on
<>the creation of this universe and Bharadva1ja gave him
<>satisfactory answers. (Chapter 182, S4a1nti Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(12) This sage performed the sacrifice Putraka1mes2t2i,
<>and gave a son to Divoda1sa. (Chapter 30, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA III. The eldest son of the Agni, S4amyu.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 219, Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHARADVA1JA IV. A renowned sage. Bharata, a King
<>of the Pu1ru line of kings, had no sons and as he was
<>spending his days in sorrow Marutta gave Bharata this
<>Bharadva1ja as a son. Bharadva1ja who was by birth a
<>brahmin from then onwards became a Ks2atriya.

<>son Bharadva1ja was preparing to give up his own life
<>by jumping into the fire when Arva1vasu brought to life
<>Yavakri1ta and gave him to the sage. Immensely pleas-

<>on earth and went to heaven. (M.B., Vana Parva,
<>165-168)
<HI>BHARADVA1JA VI. A brahmars2i who lived in the Pu1rva-

<>ing a special type of Yajn5a he went to bathe in the [Page118-a+ 64]
<>river along with other sages. There he saw the celes-

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Dus2yanta was once hunting in the forests when
<>he hit a fawn with his arrow. The fawn fled to the
<>A1s4rama of Kan2va Muni and the king followed it. On
<>reaching the A1s4rama grounds he saw S4akuntala1 water-
<>ing the plants helped by her companions Anasu1ya and
<>Priyam3vada1. Dus2yanta and S4akuntala1 fell in love with
<>each other at first sight. Kan2va was absent from the
<>A1s4rama and they married according to the Ga1ndharva
<>rites and S4akuntala1 became pregnant soon. The king
<>gave her his signet ring as a sign of faith and left for
<>his palace. When Dus2yanta left her S4akuntala1 fell into
<>a deep reverie and she never knew about the arrival of
<>the arrogant sage, Durva1sas to the a1s4rama. Durva1sas
<>mistook her as disrespectful and cursed her saying that
<>she would be forgotten by the man of whom she was
<>thinking then. S4akuntala1 never knew about the curse
<>also. [Page118-b+ 65]
<NI>Kan2va Muni when he returned to the A1s4rama and knew
<>everything, sent S4akuntala1 to the palace of Dus2yanta.
<>But King Dus2yanta never recognised her and when
<>S4akuntala1 was returning deeply grieved Menaka1 her
<>mother, took her and left her in the a1s4rama of Kas4yapa.
<>There S4akuntala1 delivered a son. The boy grew brave
<>and fearless and he could subdue even the wildest of
<>animals around there. Kas4yapa, therefore, named him
<>Sarvadamana.
<NI>Once when Dus2yanta was returning home after visiting
<>Indra he saw S4akuntala1, recognised her, and took her
<>and the boy to his palace. This was the boy who later
<>on became known as Bharata. (Chapter 73, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>3) {%Marriage and reign.%} Bharata was a partial incarna-
<>tion of Maha1vis2n2u. Even while he was young he became
<>a ruler and conquering the world destroyed the wicked.
<>Bharata had three wives. All the sons born to them
<>were bad and so the mothers killed them all. Aggrieved
<>over the loss of his sons he worshipped the devas to
<>get a son for him. At that time the great preceptor
<>Br2haspati forcibly married Mamata1 the wife of his
<>brother. Mamata1 was pregnant then and when she
<>conceived from Br2haspati also she bore two children.
<>On delivery she threw the child of Br2haspati in the
<>forests and went away with the other son.
<NI>The Devas took care of the discarded child and named
<>him Bharadva1ja and gave the child to Bharata. Bharata
<>gave the boy the name Vitatha (Di1rghatamas). Bharata
<>ruled over his land for twentyseven thousand years and
<>the land was, therefore, called Bha1rata. (S4loka 96,
<>Chapter 2, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>After ruling the land ideally he left for the forests
<>entrusting the land to his son, Vitatha. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>Vitatha also was called Bharata and he had five sons:
<>Suhotra, Suhota, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu. (Chapter

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Das4aratha, King of Ayodhya1, had three wives:
<>Kausalya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1. Kausalya1 gave birth
<>to S4ri1 Ra1ma, Kaikeyi1 to Bharata and Sumitra1 to
<>Laks2man2a and S4atrughna. Kaikeyi1, mother of Bharata,
<>was the sister of Yudha1jit, Ra1ja1 of Kekeya. Bharata
<>was born on the day of Pu1ya. (S4loka 14, Sarga 18,
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a)
<NI>Das4aratha remained in sorrow without children for a
<>very long time and then he performed a Putraka1mes2t2i
<>ya1ga (A sacrificial ceremony to get children) with
<>the Mahars2i R2s2yas4r2n3ga as the officiating priest. From
<>the sacred fire arose a divine figure carrying a pot of
<>pudding and it was after taking that pudding that the
<>wives of Das4aratha became pregnant. (Sarga 15,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a). [Page119-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Till the end of S4ri1 Ra1ma's forest life.%} The sons of
<>Das4aratha married the daughters of Janaka, King of
<>Mithila1. S4ri1 Ra1ma married Si1ta1, Bharata, Ma1n2d2avi1,
<>Laks2man2a, U1rmila1 and S4atrughna, S4rutaki1rti1.
<NI>Das4aratha made arrangements to crown Ra1ma as King
<>and then leave for the forests and lead an ascetic life.
<>At that time Bharata and S4atrughna were in the
<>country of Kekaya with their uncle, Yudha1jit. When
<>the day of coronation was drawing near Kaikeyi1
<>demanded of Das4aratha the execution of two boons
<>which were once promised by Das4aratha to her long
<>ago during a battle between the devas and asuras. One
<>of them was to crown her son, Bharata, as king and the
<>other to send Ra1ma to the forests for a period of
<>fourteen years. Das4aratha was shocked to hear that.
<>But, without any hesitation, Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>accompanied by Si1ta1 went to the forests and Das4aratha
<>overcome with immense grief caused by this unplea-
<>sant turn of events fell down dead. Messengers were
<>sent then to Kekaya to bring Bharata and after travel-
<>ling for three days Bharata and S4atrughn2a reached
<>Ayodhya1. Though they were not informed of the death
<>of their father they were worried all the way because
<>of the several bad omens which they saw. On entering
<>Ayodhya1 they were shocked to find all the roads deso-
<>late and arriving at the palace they found it silent and
<>gloomy. Kaikeyi1 then told him all that had happened
<>and when Bharata knew that his mother was at the
<>root of all this calamity his rage knew no bounds.
<>Forgetting himself he drew from the sheath the glitter-
<>ing sword and stood before his mother with the drawn
<>sword wavering to strike or not to strike and mused to
<>himself “No, Not a woman and not one's own mother,
<>No, it should not be done”. Immediately after this was
<>decided, he swung the sword straight to his throat.
<>But adroitly S4atrughna intervened and swept away the
<>sword before it fell at its aim. This strong move of
<>S4atrughna brought Bharata to his senses and he looked
<>at his mother so fiendishly that at his stare his mother
<>turned pale like a flower brought near a burning flame.
<>Bharata immediately changed into the dress of a
<>Sannya1si1 and started to go to the forests. S4atrughna
<>followed his brother. Vasis2t2ha also started. The news
<>spread like wildfire and people began to crowd at the
<>palace eager to follow the brothers. Very soon a huge
<>procession was seen moving towards the forests. Vasis2t2ha
<>and Arundhati1 in a chariot in the front, Kausalya1 and
<>Sumitra1 in another next to it and Bharata and S4atru-
<>ghna closely following the chariots, walking. People
<>joined the procession from behind. The great crowd
<>of people reached the banks of the river Gan3ga1. Guha
<>coming to know of the great exile of people from
<>Ayodhya1 through spies went and saw Bharata, at first
<>in disguise, and later as himself made his acquaintance.
<>He then took Bharata and S4atrughna across the river
<>to the presence of S4ri Ra1ma at Citraku1t2a.
<NI>When they reached Citraku1t2a only Bharata-S4atrughna,
<>Vasis2t2ha and Arundhati1, Kausalya1 and Sumitra1 entered
<>the a1s4rama of S4ri1 Ra1ma, all the others remaining out-
<>side. When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were told about the
<>death of their father they were filled with grief. All the
<>sons, then, Vasis2t2ha officiating, performed the obsequies
<>of their father. Ra1ma and Bharata then discussed the
<>future. S4ri1 Ra1ma persisted in his vow and said he
<>would return to his country only after fourteen years [Page119-b+ 65]
<>and insisted that Bharata should rule the country
<>during that period. Bharata accepted the arrangement
<>saying that if his brother did not come back after four-
<>teen years he would give up his life by jumping into
<>the fire. S4ri1 Ra1ma then gave his sandals to Bharata who
<>accepting the same with due respect returned home
<>followed by others. On reaching Ayodhya1 Bharata did
<>not go to the royal palace which he considered as empty
<>because of the absence of his brother, Ra1ma and
<>abhorrent because of the presence of his mother, Kaikeyi1.
<>Instead, he went to a nearby village called Nandi and
<>installing the sandals there lived there and ruled the
<>country.
<NI>4) {%Return of S4ri1 Ra1ma.%} S4ri1 Ra1ma when he came back
<>to Ayodhya1 after fourteen years was crowned King.
<>Bharata got two sons of his wife Ma1n2d2avi1, Suba1hu and
<>S4u1rasena. While they were thus living happily in
<>Ayodhya1, message was sent through an ascetic by
<>Yudha1jit from Kekaya that some gandharvas were
<>creating trouble in that country. It was the state of
<>Sindhu in Kekaya which was subjected to this
<>molestation and on the advice of Ra1ma Bharata went
<>and subdued the trouble, killing the gandharvas. He
<>then created two small states on either side of Sindhu
<>and made his two sons the Kings of those states.
<>When S4ri1 Ra1ma gave up his life in Sarayu1 river and
<>rose to heaven as Vis2n2u Bharata and S4atrughna also
<>gave up their lives and took the forms of the conch
<>and the wheel which adorn the hands of Vis2n2u.

<HI>BHARATA III. A son of R2s2abha.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy and birth.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u-
<>Brahma1-Sva1yambhuvamanu-Priyavrata-Agni1dhra-
<>Na1bhi-R2s2abha-Bharata.
<NI>Emperor Priyavrata partitioned his empire to his eight
<>children. Agni1dhra got Jambudvi1pa. Agni1dhra had
<>nine sons: Na1bhi, Kimpurus2a, Harivars2a, Ila1vr2ta,
<>Ramya, Hiran2van, Kuru Bhadra1s4va and Ketuma1la. On
<>the death of the father Jambudvi1pa was divided into
<>nine states and Na1bhi got the land called Hima. Na1bhi
<>married Merudevi1 and got a son, R2s2abha. R2s2abha had
<>a hundred sons and Bharata was the eldest. (Chapter 1,
<>Am3s4am 2, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) {%Marriage, administration and entry into A1s4rama life.%}
<>Bharata took over the administration of the kingdom
<>at the death of his father, R2s2abha. He married Pan5ca-
<>jani1 daughter of Vis4varu1pa. They had five sons, Sumati,
<>Ra1s2trabhr2t, Sudars4ana, A1varan2a and Dhu1mraketu. The
<>Pan5cama Skandha of Bha1gavata contains a statement
<>to the effect that India got the name Bha1rata from
<>this king. (It is worthwhile remembering at this
<>juncture a previous statement that the name Bha1rata
<>was obtained from Bharata, son of Dus2yanta). Bharata
<>like his forefather was very erudite and affectionate
<>and always respected his duties. He always meditated
<>on Brahma1 and in his heart there shone the Parama-
<>purus2a in the figure of Va1sudeva adorned with Sri1vatsa,
<>Kaustubha, Vanama1la1, S4am3kha, Cakra, Gada1 and
<>Padma. He ruled the country for a crore of years and
<>after that dividing the country among his sons went to
<>the a1s4rama of Pulaha Mahars2i to spend the rest of his
<>life there. On the rocks lying in the river flowing in
<>front of the A1s4rama were the marks of Cakra on one
<>side and Na1bhi on the other and the river therefore
<>came to be known as Cakrana1bhi. Bathing in this river [Page120-a+ 59]
<>and doing pu1ja1 Bharata lived there oblivious of the
<>world outside. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Bharata and the deer.%} Bharata led a purely ascetic
<>life performing everyday the rites laid down by
<>scriptures and muttering the mystic formula of Brahma1-
<>ks2ara. One day a thirsty pregnant deer went to drink
<>water in a nearby pond. As it was drinking it heard
<>the loud roar of a lion nearby. Frightened the poor
<>animal without even waiting to quench its thirst ran
<>into the forest and on its way delivered a child and the
<>deer-babe fell into the river. The deer exhausted and
<>tormented by fear ran into a cave and fell down dead.
<>Bharata happened to see the new-born deer floating
<>on the river and took it to his a1s4rama. From then on-
<>wards Bharata's mind was diverted from the spiritual
<>to the mundane effort of taking care of the young deer.
<>The deer followed him wherever he went and if it did
<>not turn up in time in the evening after grazing
<>Bharata went about in search of it weeping. Years went
<>by and Bharata became old and died with the name of
<>the deer on his lips. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Rebirths of Bharata.%} Because he died with the
<>thought of the deer in his mind he was reborn as a
<>deer. The deer was aware of his previous birth and
<>regretted that he spent the life of a man for the sake
<>of a deer. The deer, therefore, left the house of his
<>mother in the mountain of Ka1lan5jara and went to the
<>a1s4rama of Pulaha. The pious animal daily bathed in
<>the river and died there on the bank of that river. So
<>in its next life the deer was born as the son of a
<>brahmin in the line of An3giras. That brahmin had two
<>wives and got nine sons of his first wife and one of the
<>second. The son born to the second wife was none other
<>than Bharata. In due course the brahmin died and his
<>second wife jumped into the funeral pyre and ended her
<>life. Thrown an orphan Bharata became a puppet in
<>the hands of his brothers. Bharata was asked to look
<>after the cattle and fields of his brothers for his living.
<>With great forbearance Bharata did all he was told.
<NI>One day Bharata was keeping watch over the fields of
<>his brothers. It was midnight. In the neighbourhood
<>the Can2d2a1las were making merry over the birth of a
<>child to one of the women. Some of them were bringing a
<>man bound by ropes to be given as ‘Narabali’ to the
<>goddess Ka1li1. (Narabali is the offering of a human
<>being with his head cut off to propitiate a deity). On
<>the way the man escaped and the disappointed
<>Can2d2a1las were roaming about in search of a substitute
<>when they came across Bharata keeping watch over
<>the fields. Immediately he was bound by ropes and
<>taken before the idol of Ka1li1. The effulgence of the
<>brahmin astounded Ka1li1 and getting angry for bringing
<>such a pious brahmin for sacrifice she devoured the
<>Can2d2a1las and allowed the brahmin to go free.
<NI>Escaping from there Bharata reached a village walking
<>all the way. That village was being ruled over by a
<>king called Rahu1gan2a and that king was going to see
<>Bhagava1n Kapila Mahars2i along the banks of the river
<>Iks2umati1 in a palanquin. The palanquin had not enough [Page120-b+ 63]
<>bearers and so the brahmin was asked to join the
<>team of bearers. As they were moving the palanquin
<>shook because of the wrong steps kept by Bharata. The
<>king reprimanded Bharata and Bharata then gave the
<>king fitting replies based on the ethics of Veda1nta. The
<>erudition of Bharata greatly impressed the king and he
<>stepped down from the palanquin and bowed to
<>Bharata.
<NI>Bharata went from there to the forests singing devo-
<>tional songs in praise of Vis2n2u and at last attained
<>salvation. (Pan5cama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>BHARATA IV. A sage and the famous author of Na1t2ya-
<>s4a1stra. He was a critic who lived around the year 400
<>B.C. His book on Na1t2yas4a1stra (Histrionics) is world
<>famous. Ka1lida1sa in the second act of his drama,
<>Vikramorvas4i1ya states that this Bharata used to coach
<>the devas in the art of acting. Na1t2yas4a1stra is a book
<>comprising thirtyseven chapters dealing with the art of
<>dance and music. He has written in detail about the
<>four Alam3ka1ras, Upama1, Di1paka, Ru1paka and Yamaka
<>and also about the ten requisites of a Ka1vya. He has
<>not forgotten to write about the defects and demerits
<>of Ka1vya also. Commentaries on Na1t2yas4a1stra have
<>been written by lions in the profession: Mitragupta,
<>Hars2avardhana, S4an3kuka, Udbhat2a, Bhat2t2ana1yaka and
<>Abhinavagupta. Of these ‘Abhinavabha1rati1’ the com-
<>mentary written by Abhinavagupta is the only one
<>freely available now.
<HI>BHARATA V. The Maha1bha1rata speaks about a few
<>other Bharatas who were sons of Agni. S4amyu is a son
<>of Agni known as Bharata. This Bharata has got
<>another name, U1rjja. (S4loka 6, Chapter 219, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.). There is an Agni of name Bharata with
<>a son named Bha1rata. When this Agni is propitiated
<>one gets healthy and strong and so this Agni is called
<>Pus2t2ima1n also. (S4loka 7, Chapter 219, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.). There is another Bharata son of an Agni
<>called Adbhuta. It is this Agni that burns dead bodies.
<>As this Agni lives permanently in Agnis2t2oma Yajn5as; it
<>gets the name of Niyata also. (S4loka 6, Chapter 222,
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHA1RATA (MAHA1BHA1RATA). An epic written by
<>Vya1sa.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} The Maha1bha1rata is an epic.
<>Bharata is acclaimed as the first emperor of Bha1rata.
<>The theme of this great epic is the fight between the
<>two lines of princes belonging to the dynasty of Bharata.
<>That is why the book is called Maha1bha1rata.
<>The great size of the volume and the greatness of
<>the wisdom contained therein have contributed much
<>to its getting the name, Maha1bha1rata. Once the
<>devas put the Maha1bha1rata in one pan of a balance
<>and the Vedas in the other pan. Then the devas
<>were convinced that the Maha1bha1rata weighed more
<>than all the Vedas put together. (S4lokas 269-271,

<NI>The Maha1bha1rata comprises eighteen books, each book

<NI>2) {%Contents.%} The contents of each Parva are succinctly
<>given below: The Parvas are so named as to give a
<>hint of their central theme.
<NI>(1) {%A1di Parva.%} (A1di = beginning). Pa1n2d2u and Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra, king of the Candra dynasty, are brothers. Bhi1s2ma
<>brought them up. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born blind and he
<>got a hundred children of his wife Ga1ndha1ri1. They
<>were called the Kauravas. Pa1n2d2u had two wives Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1 and got of them five sons called the
<>Pa1n2d2avas headed by the eldest Yudhis2t2hira.
<NI>(2) {%Sabha1 Parva%} (Sabha1 = court). The Pa1n2d2avas and

<>There, the Kauravas entered into a game of dice with
<>Yudhis2t2hira and through the deceitful tactics engineer-
<>ed by the keen-witted S4akuni, Yudhis2t2hira was defeated
<>and he lost everything he possessed. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>were then compelled to go into exile to the forests for
<>twelve years and spend another year after that incog-
<>nito. If they were found out during that period of
<>incognito they were to go into exile for another term
<>of twelve years. The Pa1n2d2avas accompanied by Pa1n5ca1li1
<>left for the forests.
<NI>(3) {%Vana Parva%} (Vana = forest). This is one of the
<>longest of Parvas and describes the life of the Pa1n2d2avas

<>them.
<NI>(5) {%Bhi1s2ma Parva%} (Bhi1s2ma = The first Generalissimo of
<>the Kauravas). The great Maha1bha1rata war was fought
<>in the vast expanse of Kuruks2etra lying to the north-
<>west of Delhi. Bhi1s2ma was the first generalissimo of the
<>Kauravas and Dhr2s2t2adyumna of the Pa1n2d2avas. Vya1sa
<>describes the events of the battle classifying it accord-
<>ing to the generalissimos of the Kaurava army giving
<>the four generalissimos a Parva each. Bhi1s2ma fought
<>for ten days and was struck down on the tenth day by
<>an arrow from Arjuna.
<NI>(6) {%Dron2a Parva%} (Dron2a = The second Generalissimo).
<>When Bhi1s2ma fell Dron2a took charge as the supreme
<>commander. This Parva deals with the fight under his

<>in a grim fight with maces in which Duryodhana was
<>killed. This Parva deals with the final stage of the
<>battle.
<NI>(10) {%Sauptika Parva.%} (Sauptika = pertaining to sleep).
<>This Parva tells us the tragic story of how Kr2pa1ca1rya,
<>Kr2tavarma1 and As4vattha1ma1 who were the only three
<>left with Duryodhana after the great battle went into
<>the camp of the Pa1n2d2avas at night and killed all the
<>brave warriors of the Pa1n2d2ava army, excepting the
<>Pa1n2d2avas, who were sleeping in their camp unaware of
<>the foul play lying ahead.
<NI>(11) {%Stri1 Parva.%} (Stri1 = woman). This Parva deals with
<>the great lamentation in the battlefield, after the war,
<>of Ga1ndha1ri1 and other women.
<NI>(12) {%S4a1nti Parva.%} Yudhis2t2hira was crowned king and
<>even at that time Bhi1s2ma was lying on his bed of arrows
<>awaiting death. Before taking up his duties of the state
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to where the grandsire lay dying and
<>took his blessing and instruction in dharma. This
<>instruction of Bhi1s2ma1ca1rya to King Yudhis2t2hira of the
<>three dharmas, Ra1jadharma, A1paddharma and Moks2a-

<NI>(15) {%A1s4ramava1sika Parva.%} (A1s4ramava1sa = life in a her-
<>mitage). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, the blind and his wife Ga1ndha1ri1
<>accompanied by Kunti1 left for the forests and lived
<>there for two years in a hermitage. One day the forest
<>caught fire and the three without trying to escape sat
<>on the ground facing eastwards in yoga posture and
<>calmly gave up themselves to the flames. This is dealt
<>with in this Parva.
<NI>(16) {%Mausala Parva.%} (Mausala = Mace). This Parva
<>gives the story of how the Ya1davas fought against each
<>other with maces and were destroyed and how
<>Dva1raka1 sank down into the ocean. It describes the
<>death of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma also.
<NI>(17) {%Maha1prastha1nika Parva.%} (Maha1prastha1na = Death).
<>Dharmaputra entrusts his kingdom to his successor and

<>on a long journey to Maha1meru never to return. This
<>journey to death is detailed in this Parva.
<NI>(18) {%Svarga1rohan2a Parva.%} (Svarga = Heaven). This Parva
<>describes the entry of the Pa1n2d2avas and their relatives
<>into Svarga, heaven.
<NI>3) {%Mode of Narration.%} Most of the verses in the
<>Maha1bha1rata are in the Anus2t2up metre. At certain
<>places other metres also have been used. There are
<>prose pieces also in it. There are twenty notable pieces,
<>three in A1di Parva, seven in Vana Parva, seven in S4a1nti [Page122-a+ 51]
<>Parva and three in Anus4a1sana Parva. All the pieces are
<>statements by realised souls. The style of the poetry is
<>simple and the method of presentation lively. At times
<>the imagination of the poet extends up to the horizon.
<>Though there is a flow of spiritualism throughout the
<>matter is purely mundane.
<NI>4) {%Authorship.%} Bhagava1n Vya1sa is believed to be the
<>author of Maha1bha1rata. He was a contemporary of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas. Many of the events of the
<>Maha1bha1rata were personally witnessed by Vya1sa. He
<>took three years to write this book. The following
<>s4lokas will support the above:
<Poem>Kurura1ja kulastha1na1m3
<>Dr2s2t2am3 vr2ttam3 ca yatsthitam /
<>Tatsarvam3 bhagava1n Vya1so
<>Varn2aya1ma1sa Bha1rate. //
<>(Padma pura1n2a)
<>Tribhirvars2aih2 sadottha1yi
<>Kr2s2n2advaipa1yano munih2 /
<>Maha1bha1ratama1khya1nam3
<>Kr2tava1nidamuttamam. //</Poem>
<>(S4loka 55, Chapter 62, A1di Parva).
<>The Vara1ha Pura1n2a states that Vya1sa composed the
<>Maha1bha1rata at a period when the end of Dva1para
<>yuga merged with the dawn of the Kaliyuga. The
<>Bha1gavata states that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a passed away on the
<>first day of Kaliyuga. The Bha1gavata is devoted to
<>admire and praise the life of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. This book also
<>is written by Vya1sa. This s4loka found in the first Chap-
<>ter of A1di Parva clears the doubt:
<Poem>Va1sudevasya ma1ha1tmyam3
<>Pa1n2d2ava1na1m3 ca satyata1m /
<>Durvr2ttam3 Dha1rttara1s2t2ra1n2a1m3
<>Uktava1n Bhagava1nr2s2ih2. //</Poem>
<>The original name of the Bha1rata which Vya1sa compos-
<>ed was ‘Jaya’. In the first Chapter of A1di Parva is this
<>s4loka to support this statement:
<Poem>Na1ra1yan2am3 namaskr2tya
<>Naram3 caiva narottamam3/
<>Devi1m3 Sarasvati1m3 caiva
<>Tato Jayamudi1rayet//</Poem>
<>After the death of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas the
<>disciples of Vya1sa, Sumantu, Jaimini, Paila, S4uka and
<>Vais4ampa1yana gave this book great publicity. They
<>wrote books based on this story of Bha1rata of which
<>only the ‘Bha1rata’ of Vais4ampa1yana and the As4va-
<>medha Parva of Jaimini are now available.
<NI>Vya1sa's Bha1rata was first expounded by Vais4ampa1yana
<>at the Sarpa-satra of Janamejaya. At the request of
<>Janamejaya, Vais4ampa1yana added some more facts to
<>the original work known then as ‘Jaya’. Jaya with the [Page122-b+ 69]
<>accretions came to be known as Bha1ratasam3hita1. Su1ta
<>who narrated this story to S4aunaka and others at the
<>forest of Naimis4a added some more matter to the
<>Bha1ratasam3hita1 and made it larger. The present
<>Maha1bha1rata is this expanded edition.
<NI>The following facts prove that the Maha1bha1rata has
<>thus passed through three stages of evolution:
<NI>1) This book is known by three names: Jaya, Bha1rata-
<>sam3hita1 and Maha1bha1rata.
<F>1) <Poem>(a) Jayo na1metiha1so'yam3
<>S4rotavyo vijigi1s2un2a1 (S4loka 22, Chapter 62, A1di Parva).

<>(S4loka 78, Chapter 1, A1di Parva).
<>(c) Refer to the s4loka given in para 1.</Poem></F>
<NI>2) There is a reference to the three parts of the book
<>in S4loka 66, Chapter 1 of A1di Parva.
<F>2) <Poem>Manva1di Bha1ratam3 kecid
<>A1stika1di tatha1pare
<>Tathopari cara1danye
<>Vipra1h2 samyagadhi1yire.</Poem></F>
<NI>3) There are three different opinions regarding the
<>total number of s4lokas in the Maha1bha1rata. According
<>to Ugras4ravas there are 8800 verses, according to Vya1sa
<>24000 verses and according to another statement a
<>lakh of verses.
<F>3) <Poem>Idam3 s4atasahasram3 tu loka1na1m pun2yakarman2a1m
<>Upa1khya1naih2 saha jn5eyama1dyam3 bha1ratamuttamam

<>As2t2au s4lokasahasra1n2i As2t2au s4lokas4ata1ni ca
<>Aham3 vedmi s4uko vetti San5jayo vetti va1 na va1.</Poem>
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<NI>4) The narration appears to be of three different kinds,
<>descriptive, philosophical and oratorical, indicative of
<>three different authorships.
<NI>5) Su1ta and Vais4ampa1yana have made accretions to
<>the original work ‘Jaya’ of Vya1sa.
<NI>Viewed with these facts we are led to believe that
<>Vya1sa has composed only the very essence of Maha1-
<>bha1rata comprising 8800 s4lokas and that work was
<>known as ‘Jaya’ as referred to in the first invocatory
<>verse of the epic. Vais4ampa1yana added a few verses of
<>his own and brought the number to 24,000 and gave the
<>book the name of ‘Bha1ratasam3hita1’. It was Su1ta who
<>made many more additions and made the book so big
<>as to fetch it the name of ‘Maha1bha1rata’. The epic
<>which is now current among us contains a lakh of
<>verses and it took perhaps centuries to get this transfor-
<>mation of the book from ‘Jaya’ to ‘Maha1bha1rata’.
<NI>6) {%Period of publication.%} The Kali Vars2a starts from
<>3102 B.C. The great Maha1bha1rata war was fought at
<>a period when the end of Dva1para yuga merged into
<>the dawn of Kali yuga as could be gathered from the
<>following verse from the epic:
<Poem>Antare caiva sampra1pte
<>Kalidva1parayorabhu1t /
<>Samantapan5cake yuddham3
<>Kurupa1n2d2avasenayoh2. //</Poem>
<>(S4loka 13, Chapter 2, A1di Parva).
<>So it can be deduced that the great war was fought
<>round about 3102 B.C. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra lived for eighteen
<>years after the great battle and the Pa1n2d2avas ruled the
<>country for 36 years. (Stri1 Parva, M.B.). It was when
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a died that the Pa1n2d2avas ended their rule
<>and commenced the Maha1prastha1na. So it can be sur-
<>mised that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a lived for 36 years after the war. [Page123-a+ 62]
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a died on the first day of Kali yuga, 3102 B.C.
<>Therefore it is clear the Maha1bha1rata battle was fought
<>in 3138 B.C. There are indications in other pura1n2as
<>to support this theory. There was that rare phenomenon
<>of a Saptagraha yoga (Combination in astronomical
<>position of seven planets) while King Pari1ks2it, son of
<>Arjuna, was ruling the country.
<F>1. (a) Saptars2ayo magha1yukta1h2 ka1le pa1riks2ite s4atam (Matsya pura1n2a 271. 46).
<>(b) Te tu pa1ri1ks2ite ka1le magha1sva1san dvijottama (Visnu pura1na 4, 24, 106).</F> This happened in a
<>month of Ma1gha (January) and a probe into the dates
<>of such previous occurrences revealed that a similar
<>one had happened in the month of Ma1gha in the years
<>3177 and 477 B.C. (The next one is to happen in 2223
<>A.D.). This phenomenon repeats itself in every hundred
<>years and so it is to be believed that one of the kind
<>happened in 3077 B.C. precisely during the period of
<>Pari1ks2it. It is therefore confirmatory to the statement
<>that the great war occurred in 3138 B.C.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas ruled the country for 36 years after the
<>war and Vya1sa wrote this divine epic after the death
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. Vya1sa took three years to complete
<>his work. Therefore it can be well concluded that
<>Vya1sa wrote the epic in 3100 B.C. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>commenced their Maha1prastha1na after entrusting the
<>administration of the state into the hands of Pari1ks2it.
<>This must have happened in 3102 B.C. Pari1ks2it ruled
<>the country for 60 years and so his son Janamejaya
<>became King in 3042 B.C. It was after two years of
<>his becom3ing King that he conducted the Sarpasatra
<>and it was at this Sarpasatra that Vais4ampa1yana first
<>expounded ‘Jaya’ (Maha1bha1rata) to the sages assembl-
<>ed there.
<NI>This fixing of the date of Maha1bha1rata is based on the
<>conclusions arrived at by the pandits of Bha1rata, but
<>foreign chronologists differ from us. They argue that
<>it was in the 10th century B.C. that the Maha1bha1rata
<>battle took place on the strength of the following:
<NI>The theme of the Maha1bha1rata is a fight between
<>Kurus and Pa1n5ca1las. After the war the two join and
<>there is a statement in the Yajurveda of a people
<>formed by the merger of the two. Therefore the great
<>war should have happened in the 10th century B.C. It
<>was a period of hero-worship and songs on the heroic
<>deeds of the Kurus and Pa1n2d2avas were sung and
<>handed over from one generation to the other and
<>gradually those songs took shape in the form of the
<>Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>There is another school of thought. In the Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Brahma1 is given great prominence. But in
<>Vedic times Brahma1 was not counted at all. During
<>the golden period of the Buddhists Brahma1 had a cons-
<>picuous hold on Hinduism. Therefore it should be
<>deduced that the Maha1bha1rata was written during the
<>6th century B.C. Then there were about 8,000 verses
<>in the Maha1bha1rata.
<NI>Towards the second stage of Maha1bha1rata the epic
<>grew in size bringing into its fold about 24,000 s4lokas.
<>It was at this stage that the Maha1bha1rata got a vais2n2a-
<>vite colour and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was adored as an incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u. Megasthenes who visited India in 300 B.C.
<>records that the majority of Hindus were vais2n2avites
<>at that period. There are references in certain parts [Page123-b+ 61]
<>of the Maha1bha1rata to Greeks and Buddhists. There-
<>fore a set of foreign chronologists conclude that those
<>portions of the Maha1bha1rata could have been written
<>only after Buddha and after the attack on Bha1rata by
<>the Greeks i.e. by 300 B.C.
<NI>The third stage of the Maha1bha1rata is its present form
<>and it was at this stage that it included new philosophy
<>in it. The Dharmasam3hita1 of Manusmr2ti became popular
<>in the fifth century A.D. and therefore the third stage
<>of the Maha1bha1rata must have started before that, in
<>the 3rd century A.D.
<HI>BHA1RATA II. (Bha1ratavars2a. India).
<NI>The pura1n2as describe the Earth to be constituted of
<>seven continents: Jambu1dvi1pa, Plaks2advi1pa, S4a1lmali1-
<>dvi1pa, Kus4advi1pa, Kraun5cadvi1pa, S4a1kadvi1pa and
<>Pus2karadvi1pa. Of these India is Jambu1dvi1pa.
<NI>The Bha1ratavars2a was constituted of nine islands at
<>that time in the following positions: In the centre
<>was Ila1vr2ta and to the east was Bhadravars2a. To the
<>south-east was Hiran2yaka and to the south was Bha1rata.
<>To the southwest was Hari and to the west was Ketu-
<>ma1la. To the north-west was cambaka and to the north
<>was Kuruvars2a. Beautiful Kim3purus2a vars2a stood to the
<>north-east of Ila1vr2ta. There was neither the passage of
<>time nor the fear of ageing or death in any of these
<>continents excepting Bha1ratavars2a.
<NI>This Bha1ratavars2a itself is a group of nine islands
<>each separated from the other by oceans and thus made
<>not easily accessible between each other. Indradvi1pa,
<>Kas4eruma1n, Ta1mraparn2a, Gabhastima1n, Na1gadvi1pa,
<>Kat2a1ha, Sim3hala and Va1run2a are the eight others and the
<>ninth is this island of Bha1ratavars2a. This island is called
<>Kuma1ra also. On the eastern boundary of this island live
<>Kira1tas, on the western side, Yavanas, on the southern
<>boundary A1ndhras and on the north Turus2kas. In the
<>Centre live the Bra1hmins, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas and S4u1dras.
<>The eight sacred mountains of this place are Mahendra,
<>Malaya, Sahya, S4uktima1n, R2ks2aparvata, Vindhya and
<>Pa1riya1tra. There are several other mountains also in
<>Madhyaprades4a. They are: Kola1hala, Vaibhra1ja, Man-
<>dara, Durddhara, Va1tadhu1ma, Vaidyuta, Maina1ka,
<>Sarasa, Tun3gaprastha, Na1gagiri, Govardhana, Ujjayan-
<>ta, Pus2pagiri, Arbuda, Raivataka, R2s2yamu1ka, Gomanta,
<>Citraku1t2a, Kr2tasmara, S4ri1parvata and Kon3kan2a. This
<>place is inhabited by A1ryas and Mlecchas. The rivers
<>which they use for drinking water are the following:

<HI>BHARTR2HARI. A famous Sanskrit poet.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He was the son of Vidya1sa1gara, a great brahmin
<>scholar, who lived in Pa1t2ali1putra. There is a legend
<>about the birth of Bhartr2hari in Uttara Bha1rata.
<NI>Vidya1sa1gara while young learnt the Vedas from his
<>guru. But he was not satisfied with that study and
<>wanted to learn more about all s4a1stras and so he started
<>on a tour to find out a guru who would teach him all
<>he wanted. On his way he met several great scholars
<>but none came up to his standard of a guru. One day
<>tired after a long journey he reached a mountain valley.
<>Washing his hands and feet in a nearby river and
<>quenching his thirst he went and sat down under a
<>banyan tree to rest. The cool breeze sent the tired
<>brahmin to sleep and he slept.
<NI>A Brahmara1ks2asa who was living on the top of the ban-
<>yan tree when it became midday descended from
<>the tree to perform the sacred rites of the day and found
<>a man lying asleep. By the sacred thread on his body
<>the Brahmara1ks2asa surmised that the man was a brah-
<>min and woke him up. Waking up Vidya1sa1gara found
<>to his surprise the bearded Brahmara1ks2asa standing be-
<>fore him and after mutual enquiries Vidya1sa1gara told
<>him of his mission. The Brahmara1ks2asa told him thus:
<>“Boy, let your name Vidya1sa1gara (ocean of learning)
<>be true in your life. I am acquainted with many s4a1st-
<>ras and I shall teach you everything I know. But there
<>are certain conditions for the same which you have to
<>observe. You must live with me for six months and
<>should fast during that period behaving yourself as
<>one under a vow. I shall, however, teach you a mantra
<>which would help you to remain unaffected by hunger,
<>thirst or sleep. If you are prepared to accept these terms
<>and become my disciple I shall quench your thirst for
<>knowledge. Vidya1sa1gara willingly agreed to his terms
<>and became his student.
<NI>Both of them then climbed on the banyan tree and the
<>Brahmara1ks2asa sat in his usual place on a branch on
<>the tree and Vidya1sa1gara on a branch just below it. The
<>instructions started and continued for six months.
<>Vidya1sa1gara never felt thirst or hunger during that
<>period. When the teaching was complete the Brahma- [Page125-a+ 64]
<>ra1ks2asa bade farewell to his disciple and departed leaving
<>his body behind.
<NI>Vidya1sa1gara then got down from the tree and performed
<>the obsequies of his guru. Vidya1sa1gara while he was
<>learning used to note down the instructions of the guru
<>on the leaves of the banyan tree. It had come to a huge
<>bundle on completion. Taking the bundle along with
<>him Vidya1sa1gara left for his country. By the time he
<>left the forest area the power of the mantra faded and
<>Vidya1sa1gara began to feel the pangs of hunger and
<>thirst. By dusk he reached Kalin3ga and there he came
<>to the door of a dancing girl named Manda1kini1. The
<>door was locked as the owner was away in a S4iva temple
<>nearby. Exhausted by the journey, hungry and thirsty,
<>Vidya1sa1gara lay down on the doorstep and soon fell
<>asleep with the leaf-bundle as a pillow. Manda1kini1 when
<>she returned from the temple at about ten at night saw
<>a brahmin sleeping on the doorstep, tired and exhaust-
<>ed. She soon asked her servants to get him inside and
<>sent for a doctor. By the clever treatment of the doctor
<>and the expert nursing of Manda1kini1, Vidya1sa1gara sur-
<>vived. When he was fit for travel he started to go but
<>Manda1kini1 objected and requested him to marry her.
<>Vidya1sa1gara did not agree to it and she took him to the
<>King and told him all that had happened. Finding
<>Vidya1sa1gara to be one with great erudition and good
<>manners he decided that Vidya1sa1gara should marry
<>his daughter (a Ks2atriya), daughter of his minister
<>(a brahmin), daughter of Kulapati (a vais4ya), and
<>also Manda1kini1 (a S4u1dra). There was an injunction in
<>those days that a brahmin should marry a S4u1dra only
<>after having married from all the higher castes. The
<>decision of the King surmounted this difficulty for
<>Vidya1sa1gara to marry the s4u1dra girl, Manda1kini1.
<>Marriages were all conducted in order. The King's
<>daughter bore the name Kala1vati1, the minister's Ma1lati1
<>and Kulapati's Suman3gali1. Each delivered a son. The
<>brahmin boy was named Vararuci, the Ks2atriya boy,
<>Vikrama1ditya, the Vais4ya boy, Bhat2t2i and the S4u1dra
<>boy, Bhartr2hari.
<NI>2) {%Kingship.%} When the King of Kalin3ga became old
<>he gave the kingdom to Vidya1sa1gara and when Vidya1-
<>sa1gara died all his other sons made Bhartr2hari the King.
<>Bhartr2hari gave his father on his death-bed a promise
<>that he would see that no sons were born to him.
<F>1) There is a belief that if a son is born to a S4u1dra who was himself born of a brahmin the brahmin father would go to hell.</F>
<>So though Bhartr2hari married three wives he was care-
<>ful enough not to produce any children by them.
<NI>3) {%Bhartr2hari becomes a sannya1si1.%} Bhartr2hari was living
<>happily with his wife when one day a yogi1 of divine
<>disposition came to his house and giving him a ripe
<>mango said: “If you eat this mango you will never
<>become old. It is because you who are perfect in edu-
<>cation and fortune should live long for the benefit of
<>the people that I am giving you this.” So saying he
<>gave the mango and left the place. When the sannya1si1
<>left him Bhartr2hari thought thus: “After some years
<>my wife would become old and die. What is the use
<>of my remaining alive after she is gone. So this mango
<>should be given to her. Let her live long.” He,
<>therefore, gave the mango to his wife explaining
<>to her the greatness of the fruit. That wife whom poor
<>Bhartr2hari accepted to be very loving and chaste
<>had a lover. He was none other than the horse- [Page125-b+ 64]
<>groom of her husband and that prostitute thought
<>thus: “Of what use is my life when my lover is dead.
<>Let him live for ever”. So thinking she sent for her
<>lover and giving him the mango explained to him the
<>greatness of the thing. But the horse-groom was well
<>devoted to his wife and desiring that his wife should
<>remain young always he gave it to her. The groom's
<>wife was a servant-maid of the palace and it was at the
<>time of her departure from the palace after her day's
<>work that she was given the mango by the horse-groom
<>and so she carried it home in her hand. Bhartr2hari
<>who was returning from somewhere to the palace saw
<>the woman carrying the mango and questioned her and
<>knew how she got it. On coming to the palace he sent
<>for the horse-groom and though at first the horse-groom
<>tried to shield the queen, he was compelled to tell the
<>truth in the end. The truth pained him much “Phew!
<>It was this wretched and unfaithful woman whom I was
<>believing to be very chaste and loving. Woman can never
<>be believed. Look, she has fallen in love with an ugly-
<>looking servant of mine and unless he was her lover she
<>would not have given this mango to him. It is better
<>that this matter is not pursued any further now. We
<>will decide about the future course of action later”.
<>Thinking thus, he sent away the horse-groom and went
<>to his bed-chamber and lay there immersed in thoughts.
<>The horse-groom immediately informed the queen of
<>everything that took place and the queen felt sorry that
<>her secret had come to light. She knew that besides the
<>punishment that her lover would get her name would
<>also be blackened and so decided to kill her husband
<>before the affair became public. At once she made an
<>ot2t2at2a (flat bread made of wheat or rice) with poison in
<>it and bringing it to the bed-room told her husband thus
<>with much pretended affection. “It will take some time
<>for your lunch to be ready. Let not you lie with an
<>empty stomach. Eat this now”. So saying she placed
<>the bread in the hands of Bhartr2hari and left the room.
<NI>Bhartr2hari suspected foul play and mused “This bread
<>has been prepared by her with poison to kill me. It is
<>better to give up living with her. There is no doubt
<>about it. Of the four a1s4ramas the fourth, Sannya1sa, is
<>the best. It is pleasant and sorrowless. Therefore gra-
<>dually that a1s4rama should be accepted”. Thinking thus
<>he came out from his room with the bread and placed
<>it hidden somewhere in the lower end of the roof of the
<>house remarking “Ot2t2appam Vi1t2t2eccut2um” (The ot2t2at2a
<>will burn the house). Then taking an earthern bowl for
<>begging he left the house unnoticed by any. The moment
<>Bhartr2hari left the house the house caught fire and
<>everything in it was burnt to ashes.
<NI>Bhartr2hari renouncing all and changing himself into
<>the robes of a sannya1si1 went about living by begging.
<>After some time he decided that he would never beg but
<>would eat only that which others gave him voluntarily.
<>He had by that time reached a big temple
<F>2) This temple is believed to be the Chidam3baram3 Temple.</F> in south
<>India where in one of the entrances to the temple, the
<>east one, was sitting the famous sannya1si1 Pat2t2anatt
<>Pillaya1r. Bhartr2hari, therefore, went and sat at the
<>western entrance with his bowl before him. Whatever
<>food fell into the bowl was eaten by him. Sometimes
<>for days together he went without food. But he never
<>was sick or felt weak. [Page126-a+ 65]
<NI>One day a beggar went to the eastern gate and asked
<>Pat2t2anatt Pillaya1r for alms. Pillaya1r said, “I am also a
<>beggar like you. I have nothing in my hand to give you.
<>But there is a man sitting in the western gate. He is a
<>rich man and he may give you something”. The beggar
<>went to Bhartr2hari and asked for alms. Bhartr2hari
<>also expressed his helplessness in the matter. But then
<>the beggar said “The man sitting at the opposite entrance
<>told me that you were a rich man.” Bhartr2hari smiled.
<>He knew then why Pat2t2anatt Pillaya1r said so. A man who
<>has renounced everything need not keep even a bowl to
<>beg. The bowl was a luxury and a sign of wealth.
<>Bhartr2hari threw away the bowl and remained at the
<>temple entrance till the end of his life. It was while
<>sitting there that he wrote his famous poems.
<NI>4) His well-known works are: (1) The Ni1ti S4ataka (2)
<>The S4r2n3ga1ra S4ataka (3) The Vaira1gya S4ataka and (4)
<>The Subha1s2itas.
<HI>BHARTR2STHA1NA(M). A very holy place in ancient
<>India. It is said that even those who merely visited this
<>place would get the benefit of performing an As4vamedha
<>yajn5a. The place got its importance because Lord
<>Subrahman2ya lived there. (S4loka 76, Chapter 84, Vana
<>Parva, M.B.)
<HI>BHA1RU. A daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. The praja1pati,
<>at one stage begot sixty girls of Vairin2i1 and gave them
<>to Kas4yapa, who distributed them among several Devas.
<>Bha1ru was the woman so given to the Vis4vadevata1s.
<>(Hari Vam3s4a, Chapter 3).
<HI>BHARUKA. A king of the Solar dynasty. He was the
<>son of Sudeva and father of Ba1huka. (Navama Skanda,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>BHARUKAKS2A(M). A village of ancient India.
<>S4u1dras lived there. At that time of the Ra1jasu1ya of
<>Dharmaputra these S4u1dras brought gifts to the King.
<>(Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>BHA1RUN2D2A. A particular kind of bird found in the
<>Kingdom called Uttarakuruvars2a. These birds carry in
<>their strong beak corpses to their caves and eat them.
<>(Bhi1s2maparva, Chapter 7, Verse 12).
<HI>BHA1RYA1. Wife. Bhi1s2ma points out the sanctified impor-
<>tance of Bha1rya1 (wife) as follows:--
<NI>Without her even the palace will prove itself to be just a
<>forest. She will be a great support (to the husband) in
<>the matter of dharma (duty) artha (wealth) and Ka1ma
<>(enjoyment of material comforts). (These three precede
<>the ultimate state of Moks2a (salvation) and the wife will
<>be a great support in fulfilling the conditions during the
<>first three stages.) While on tour in foreign places she
<>will remain faithful to him and instil confidence in him.
<>Bha1rya1 is great wealth to man.
<NI>In his forlorn life on earth the wife is of great help to
<>man. To him, who is suffering from diseases and is
<>otherwise in distress there is no remedy (medicine) like
<>a good wife. There is no relative like a wife. In the
<>matter of practising dharma there is no other support to
<>match the wife. If one has no good wife to take care of
<>domestic affairs one will be driven to the forest; the
<>home will be like a forest. (S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 144).
<HI>BHA1SA. A very prominent dramatist in Sanskrit. As
<>Ba1n2a and Ka1lida1sa have noticed him in their works,
<>it may safely be assumed that Bha1sa lived in an earlier
<>period. Since Pratima1 na1t2aka and Abhis2eka na1t2aka,
<>which are universally admitted to have been composed
<>by Bha1sa, depend for their themes on the Va1lmi1ki [Page126-b+ 65]
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, it is clear that Bha1sa lived after Va1lmi1ki.
<>Ka1lida1sa's period has not yet been fixed beyond doubt.
<>It is almost settled that Ba1n2a lived sometime between the
<>sixth and seventh centuries A.D. Prof. Keith has been
<>of the view that Va1lmi1ki lived before the 4th century
<>B.C. In the light of all such factors it could be presumed
<>that Bha1sa lived in the period between the 4th century
<>B.C. and 6th century A.D.
<NI>Though Bha1sa has so many glories to his credit he does
<>not fully match Ka1lida1sa, and this might have been the
<>reason why Indians did almost forget Bha1sa with the
<>advent of Ka1lida1sa on the literary arena.
<NI>We are not in a position to name with unerring definite-
<>ness the works of Bha1sa. The general belief is that he
<>has written nearly twenty three dramas. In 1922, Pandit
<>Gan2apati S4a1stri1 unearthed from various sources thirteen
<>dramas of Bha1sa. Three out of them, viz. Pratijn5a1-
<>yaugandhara1yan2a, S4vapnava1savadatta and Avima1-
<>raka owe their themes to the Br2hatkatha1, while Prati-
<>ma1 na1t2aka and Abhis2eka na1t2aka have Ra1ma1yan2a as
<>their basic inspiration. Out of the eight remaining
<>dramas six, viz. Madhyama vya1yoga, Pan5cara1tra, Du1ta-
<>va1kya, Du1taghat2otkaca, Karn2abha1ra and U1rubhan3ga
<>owe their themes to the Maha1bha1rata, while the last
<>two dramas, Ba1lacarita and Ca1rudatta are dependent
<>for their themes on anecdotes about S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and on
<>yaks2a stories.
<NI>Though Dr. Gan2apati S4a1stri1 has strongly contended that
<>all the above thirteen dramas were written by Bha1sa
<>himself, his view has not yet received universal accep-
<>tance. Whatever that be, it is an admitted fact that
<>Svapnava1savadatta is by far the best among the thirteen
<>dramas. It is a continuation of the story of Pratijn5a1yau-
<>gandhara1yan2a. The wedding of king Udayana and
<>Va1savadatta1 is the subject matter of Svapnava1sava-
<>datta.
<NI>With his killing of the Ra1ks2asa ‘Avi’ the Sauvi1ra king
<>comes to be known as Avima1ra, and Avima1ra's falling
<>in love with Kuran3gi1, daughter of Kuntibhoja forms the
<>theme of the drama, Avima1raka. In Pratima1 na1t2aka
<>is told the story narrated in Ra1ma1yan2a from Ayodhya1-
<>ka1n2d2a to Pat2t2a1bhis2eka. Abhis2eka na1t2aka codifies the
<>stories in the Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a and Sundara Ka1n2d2a of
<>the R2a1ma1yan2a and describes the coronations of Sugri1va
<>and of S4ri1 Ra1ma. Though the characters in Pan5cara1tra
<>are borrowed from Maha1bha1rata the story is entirely
<>Bha1sa's. Madhyama vya1yoga, Du1tava1kya, Du1taghat2ot-
<>kaca, Karn2abha1ra and U1rubhan3ga are one-act plays.
<>These five plays have as their basis some of the anecdotes
<>in the Maha1bha1rata. In Ca1rudatta is treated the love
<>story of Ca1rudatta and Vasantasena1.
<NI>Indisputable evidence is still lacking to credit Bha1sa
<>with the authorship of all the thirteen plays referred to
<>above.
<HI>BHA1SAS. (See Bha1si1).
<HI>BHA1SAKARN2A. A military captain of Ra1van2a. Hanu-
<>ma1n killed him in fight. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a 46, 47).
<HI>BHA1SI1. Daughter of Ta1mra1, Daks2a's daughter. Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati married the following daughters of Daks2a:
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1, Ta1mra1 had five daughters, viz. Kraun5ci1,
<>Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. And, the sons of
<>Bha1si1 are the Deva sect called the Bha1sas. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, A1ran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14). [Page127-a+ 65]
<HI>BHA1SKARA. One of the Dva1das4a1dityas born of Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati and Aditi. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Verse 150).
<HI>BHA1SKARA1CA1RYA. A master astronomer of ancient
<>India. It was he who declared, much earlier than western
<>experts, that the earth is round in shape.
<HI>BHA1SKARI. An old mahars2i of India. He accompanied
<>the R2s2is who visited Bhi1s2ma on his bed of arrows. (S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 47, Verse 12).
<HI>BHASMA. (Sacred ash). To know a story about the
<>greatness of Bhasma see under the word Durjaya.
<HI>BHASMA1SURA. A demon. There is no mention about
<>this demon in any of the Sanskrit pura1n2as but ‘S4ivali1-
<>la1mr2ta’ in Mara1t2hi contains the following story about
<>him.
<NI>Bhasma1sura was born of the Bhasma dust (ashes) on
<>the body of S4iva. Pleased at the great devotion of the
<>demon towards him S4iva asked him to name any boon
<>he wanted. Bhasma1sura said that he wanted the power
<>to burn to ashes anybody on whose head he placed his
<>hand. Bhasma1sura became arrogant with the boon
<>and he became a nightmare to the whole world. Then
<>Maha1vis2n2u appeared before him in the form of Mohini1,
<>an attractive dancer and alluring him by her charm
<>started on a dance called Muktanr2tya. During the course
<>of this dance Bhasma1sura was forced to place his hand
<>on his own head and the moment his head touched his
<>head he was burnt to ashes.
<HI>BHA1SVARA. One of the two attendants presented by
<>Su1rya to Subrahman2ya; the other was named Subh-
<>ra1ja. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 31).
<HI>BHAT2T2ANA1RA1YAN2A. A sanskrit poet who flourished
<>near about A.D. 700. Ven2i1sam3ha1ra, a drama in six
<>acts is the only composition of his found out, yet. He
<>is also known by another name, Mr2gara1jalaks2ma.
<>Certain scholars opine that he might have lived before
<>Ba1n2a and after Va1mana.
<HI>BHAT2T2ANA1YAKA. A literary critic who flourished in
<>the 10th century A.D. in India. He composed a critical
<>study on the science of dance (Na1t2ya) named Hr2daya-
<>darpan2a based on the Na1t2ya s4a1stra of Bharata. But,
<>the book has not been found out, yet. Contesting the
<>dhvaniva1da (the rhetorical theory that in poetry sugges-
<>ted or implied meaning is superior to the explicit mean-
<>ning) of A1nandavardhana1ca1rya, he established the rasa-
<>va1da (that sentiment is supreme in poetry). Abhi-
<>navagupta also has supported the rasava1da. Hence,
<>it may be inferred that Bhat2t2ana1yaka lived in the period
<>after A1nandavardhana and anterior to Abhinavagupta.
<>Bhat2t2ana1yaka's theory is that Abhidha1, Bha1vakatvam3
<>and Bhojakatvam3 should be the three excellences of
<>good poetry.
<HI>BHAT2T2I. A sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th century
<>A.D. His most important composition is the Maha1-
<>ka1vya, Ra1van2avadha, which has become very popular
<>and famous by the name Bhat2t2ika1vya. This maha1ka1vya
<>deals with the story of Ra1ma1yan2a in its twentytwo
<>Ka1n2d2as (cantos). The ka1vya is believed to have been
<>composed at Valabhi1 in obedience to the request of
<>King S4ri1dharasena.
<HI>BHAUMA I. The fourteenth Manu. In the time of this
<>Manu, the person called S4uci will be Indra. Under his
<>control there will be five groups of Devas. These groups
<>are called Ca1ks2us2as, Pavitras, Kanis2t2has, Bhra1jikas
<>and Va1pa1vr2ddhas. The Saptars2is (seven sages) of that
<>Manvantara are Agniba1hu, S4uci, S4ukra, Ma1gadha, [Page127-b+ 65]
<>Agni1dhra, Yukta and Jita. At that time, the sons of
<>Manu who will be protecting the earth will be U1ru,
<>gam3bhi1rabuddhi and other Kings. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>3rd Part, Chapter 2).
<HI>BHAUMA II. Another name of Naraka1sura. (See the
<>word Naraka1sura).
<HI>BHAUMA III. A Ra1ks2asa born to Sim3hika1 by Vipracitti.
<>Paras4u-Ra1ma killed him. (Brahma1n2d2a--3-6-18-22).
<HI>BHAUTYA. See the word Manvantara.
<HI>BHAVA I. One of the eleven Rudras. He was the son of
<>Stha1n2u and grandson of Brahma1. (Chapter 66, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHAVA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. (Chapter 60, A1di
<>Parva, M.B.).
<HI>BHAVA III. One of the sons born to Kas4yapa of Sura-
<>bhi.
<HI>BHA1VA(M) I. A famous forest mentioned in the
<>Pura1n2as. Bha1va was near the Ven2umanda mountain,
<>which was close to Dva1raka1. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>BHA1VA. One of the twelve Devas born to Bhr2guva1run2i
<>R2s2i of his wife Divya1.
<HI>BHAVABHU1TI. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th
<>century A.D. His important works are the three dramas,
<>Ma1lati1ma1dhava, Maha1vi1racarita and Uttarara1ma-
<>carita. Bhavabhu1ti was a brahmin of the Kas4yapa-
<>gotra. He was the son of one Ni1lakan2t2ha and one Ja1tu-
<>karn2i1. He was a great devotee of S4iva and he got his
<>name Bhavabhu1ti later because of this. His original
<>name was Ni1lakan2t2ha. Bhavabhu1ti was born in Padma-
<>pura in the state of Vidarbha. But Bhavabhu1ti spent
<>most of his life in the palace of Yas4odharma1, king of
<>Kannauj.
<NI>Bhavabhu1ti's first drama is believed to be Maha1vi1ra-
<>carita. There are seven acts in this. The theme is based
<>on the story of S4ri1 Ra1ma. But there are some variations
<>from the original Ra1ma1yan2a in this drama. Bhava-
<>bhu1ti states that even at the time of the svayam3vara of
<>Si1ta1, Ra1van2a was a suitor. There is an opinion among
<>certain critics that Bhavabhu1ti did write only up to the
<>46th verse in the fourth act and the rest was written
<>by another poet named Subrahman2ya.
<NI>Ma1lati1ma1dhava is a drama of ten acts. It is a love-story
<>of Ma1lati1 and Ma1dhava. Ma1lati1 was the daughter of the
<>minister of Ujjayini1 and Madhava was the son of the
<>minister of Vidarbha. It was while Ma1dhava was having
<>his education in Ujjayini1 that he came to love Ma1lati1.
<>It was Ka1mandaki1 who was a classmate of both the
<>ministers and who became a sannya1sini1 later who pulls
<>the strings of this love story. The king of Ujjayini1 wanted
<>Ma1lati1 to marry Nandana, a friend of his. But Ma1lati1
<>did not love him. Yet afraid of getting the displeasure of
<>the King, Ma1lati1's father decided to give her in marriage
<>to Nandana. In despair Ma1dhava was about to commit
<>suicide when from the temple nearby Ma1dhava heard
<>an agonised weeping. He rushed to the site of the sound
<>and found to his bewilderment the gruesome sight of
<>Ma1lati1 being dragged for sacrifice by a sorceress named
<>Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 helped by her guru Aghoraghan2t2a.
<>Ma1dhava killed Aghoraghan2t2a and saved Ma1lati1.
<>Disappointed Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 swore that she would
<>seek revenge on Ma1dhava and disappeared. Ma1lati1
<>went back to her palace. At this time Madayantika1,
<>sister of Nandana and Makaranda, a friend of Ma1dhava
<>became lovers. Once Madayantika1 was attacked by a
<>tiger in a S4iva temple and Makaranda saved her from [Page128-a+ 63]
<>the wild beast, and they became lovers thereafter. The
<>proposal to give Ma1lati1 in marriage to Nandana was
<>still pending then. The marriage day was fixed and a
<>day before that by a clever ruse played by the keen-
<>witted Ka1mandaki1 Ma1lati1 and Ma1dhava eloped together.
<>Makaranda, friend of Ma1dhava, was disguised and dressed
<>in bridal robes and Nandana little suspecting the trick
<>played on him married the substitute. Before they went
<>to the bridal chamber for the night Nandana's sister
<>came to see her new sister-in-law and the moment she
<>put her eyes on her she understood who it was and that
<>night they also eloped. Thus poor Nandana was left
<>alone.
<NI>Kapa1lakun2d2ala1 by her sorcery separated Ma1lati1 from
<>Ma1dhava but luckily Sauda1mini1 a disciple of Ka1man-
<>taki1 saved her from Kapa1lakun2d2ala1. Later Ma1lati1
<>married Ma1dhava with the permission of the King.
<>This is the story of Ma1lati1-Ma1dhava.
<NI>Uttarara1macarita is a play of seven acts. The theme is
<>the story of Ra1ma after his return to Ayodhya1 after the
<>exile. It begins with the renouncement of Si1ta1 by Ra1ma
<>and ends with the vanishing of Si1ta1.
<NI>All these three dramas used to be enacted during the
<>festival of ‘Ka1lapriyana1tha’ at Ujjayini1. The predomi-
<>nant emotion in Maha1vi1racarita is ‘Vi1ra’, in Ma1lati1-
<>Ma1dhava, ‘Sr2n3ga1ra’ and in Uttarara1macarita ‘Karun2a’.
<>In expressing and elaborating the emotion of ‘Karun2a’
<>Bhavabhu1ti excels Ka1lida1sa. The one draw-back which
<>keeps him second to Ka1lida1sa is his lack of humour and
<>wit. The sanskrit poet Dhanapa1la in his book’
<>‘Tilakaman5jari’ speaks about Bhavabhu1ti thus:
<Poem>Spas2t2abha1varasa1 citraih2

<>Bha1rati1 Bhavabhu1tina1 //</Poem>
<HI>BHAVADA1. A follower of Skandadeva. (Chapter 45,
<>S4alya Parva).
<HI>BHAVANMANYU. A king of Pu1ruvam3s4a. He had five
<>sons: Br2hatks2atra, Nara, Garga, Maha1vi1rya and Jaya.
<>(Chapter 19, Am3s4a 4, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>BHA1VANIKA1. A companion of princess Mr2gam3ka1vati1.
<>(See S4ri1datta).
<HI>BHAVATI. The word prescribed by Manu to be used
<>while addressing women. Not all women should be
<>addressed like that. All women who are not your rela-
<>tives and the wives of others should be addressed using
<>any one of the following words: Bhavati, Subhage or
<>Bhagini.

<HI>BHA1VAYAVYA. A muni, whose glories are sung in the
<>R2gveda. He married Romas4a1, daughter of Bhr2haspati.
<>Once she approached her husband with the request for
<>coition, and the husband laughed at her. (R2gveda,
<>Man2d2ala 19, Anuva1ka 19, Su1kta 127).

<>Parva, Chapter 44, Verse 11).

<HI>BHI1MA. Bhi1masena, one of the five Pa1n2d2avas.
<F>1) Since much information about Bhi1ma is given under the captions Dharmaputra, Arjuna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pa1n5ca1li1 only
<>a brief description of Bhi1ma is attempted under the present heading.</F>
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See genealogy of Arjuna).
<NI>2) {%Birth and childhood.%} King Vicitravi1rya of Candra
<>vam3s4a (lunar dynasty) had two sons called Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and Pa1n2d2u. The Kauravas (Duryodhana etc.) were
<>sons born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of his wife Ga1ndha1ri1, and the [Page129-a+ 65]
<>Pa1n2d2avas were the sons of Pa1n2d2u and his wives Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1. Dharmaputra, Bhi1ma and Arjuna were
<>the sons of Kunti1, and Nakula and Sahadeva of
<>Ma1dri1.
<F>1) The Pa1n2d2avas were not in fact direct issues of Pa1n2d2u. For details see Kunti1.</F>
<NI>Kunti1 directed a mantra gifted to her by Durva1sas to-
<>wards Va1yubhagava1n (the wind-god) and the result
<>was the birth of Bhi1ma. Hence he is called Va1yu-putra
<>(son of the wind-god). At the time of his birth a celestial
<>voice announced that the boy would grow up to be the
<>strongest among the strong. (A1di Parva, Chapter 122,
<>Verse 14). On the tenth day after birth the child Bhi1ma
<>fell from his mother's lap on a rock. Bhi1ma was not
<>injured in any manner by that fall, although it crushed
<>the rock into power. (This story is told in the southern
<>texts of the Maha1bha1rata in Chapter 132 of A1di Parva).
<>The naming ceremony of the child was performed by
<>the Mahars2is, who stayed at S4atas4r2n3ga. Kas4yapa Maha-
<>rs2i, family priest of Vasudeva performed the ceremonies
<>like wearing of the sacred thread. Bhi1ma learned fight-
<>ing with the gada1 (club or mace) from S4uka, the famous
<>Ra1jars2i.
<NI>The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas spent their childhood
<>in Hastina1pura. Dron2a1ca1rya taught them fighting
<>with weapons. The Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas often
<>engaged themselves in children's games. In all such
<>games Bhi1ma used to hurt and defeat the Kauravas,
<>and to this fact the unending hatred of the Kauravas
<>towards Bhi1ma owed its origin. Once they adminis-
<>tered poison to Bhi1ma who fell down unconscious, and
<>then they threw him into the depths of the Gan3ga1
<>(Ganges). Going deeper and deeper in the waters
<>Bhi1ma, at last, reached the Na1galoka, where the na1gas
<>(serpents) bit him which neutralized the effects of the
<>poison in his body. There he got acquainted with a
<>na1ga called A1ryaka, who introduced him to Va1suki,
<>king of the na1gas, and Va1suki presented him with much
<>wealth and other costly gems. But, what use was all
<>this wealth to Bhi1ma? Then Va1suki agreed to give him
<>a divine drink, which would give the user of it the
<>strength of thousand elephants. Bhi1ma drank at one
<>draught eight pot-fulls of that divine drink, and thus
<>became tremendously strong. But, he had to wait in
<>Na1galoka for eight days so that the drink might be
<>thoroughly assimilated, and on the ninth day the na1gas
<>saw him off in all pomp and splendour. Bhi1ma returned
<>to his mother and brothers and consoled them, who
<>were terribly anxious at his absence.
<NI>When the training of the princes in the use of weapons
<>was over a competition or test was conducted. Duryo-
<>dhana and Bhi1ma entered into a ‘club-fight’, and when
<>Karn2a tried to intervene in the fight his nobility was
<>questioned by Bhi1ma. Duryodhana then insulted Bhi1ma.
<>Arjuna agreed to present King Drupada before Dron2a1-
<>ca1rya as gurudaks2ina1 to him. In the fierce war the
<>Pa1n2d2avas fought with Drupada, Bhi1ma annihilated the
<>elephant division of the latter's army. And, afterwards
<>Bhi1ma underwent higher training in club-war at the
<>hands of Balabhadrara1ma. (A1di Parva, Chapter 136,
<>Verse 4).
<NI>3) {%The Pa1n2d2avas left Hastina1pura.%} As enmity between
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas began growing stronger
<>and stronger, Duryodhana, with his father's permission,
<>removed the Pa1n2d2avas to va1ran2a1vata and settled them
<>there. They were put up there in a palace specially [Page129-b+ 64]
<>made of lac. The Pa1n2d2avas divined the secret of it and
<>escaped from the fire, when the palace was set fire to.
<>Verse 10, Chapter 147 of the A1di Parva states that it
<>was Bhi1ma, who set fire to the palace. Escaping thus
<>through a tunnel the Pa1n2d2avas travelled a great distance
<>in the forest. Kunti1 and four of her sons got tired by the
<>exertions of the travel and were forced to sit down for
<>rest on the way. Bhi1ma, continued the journey carrying
<>the mother and his four brothers on his shoulders. With
<>their entry into Hid2im3ba forest the weakness left them,
<>and they became their former selves.
<NI>4) {%Hid2im3ba killed.%} Kunti1 devi1 and four sons slept under
<>the shade of a tree at dusk, and Bhi1ma kept guard over
<>them. There dwelt in the forest a Ra1ks2asa called Hid2im3ba
<>with his sister, Hid2im3bi1. Hid2im3ba looked around that
<>particular day from the top of a tree, and detecting
<>Bhi1ma his mouth watered. He deputed Hid2imbi1 to
<>bring Bhi1ma over to him. Hid2im3bi1 approached Bhi1ma,
<>whose fine figure kindled feelings of love in her. She
<>desired to have him as husband. Hid2im3bi1 having not
<>returned even after a long time Hidim3ba went over to
<>the spot, and there finding Hid2im3bi1 in love-talks with
<>Bhi1ma he got terribly angry. He wanted to kill Hid2im3bi1.
<>Bhi1ma, who could not suffer the killing of a woman in
<>his presence rushed against Hid2im3ba, The noise of the
<>fight awakened the other Pa1n2d2avas from sleep, and at
<>the instance of Arjuna, Bhi1ma killed Hid2im3ba. Thus
<>rendered helpless and forlorn Hid2im3bi1 again craved
<>Bhi1ma for love. On the suggestion of Kunti1, whose
<>heart melted at the sight of Hid2im3bi1's helplessness Bhi1ma
<>took her as his wife. But, one condition was stipulated
<>for their enjoying the honey-moon. The condition was
<>that they might enjoy honey-moon, from dawn to dusk
<>in the sky and on mountain tops, Hid2im3bi1, who was
<>endowed with magic powers carrying Bhi1ma with her.
<>And, after dusk Bhi1ma was to be returned to Kunti1.
<>Accordingly Bhi1ma and Hid2im3bi1 spent one year, and
<>to them was born a son called Ghat2otkaca. Promising
<>that he shall return when wanted, Ghat2otkaca with his
<>mother went into the forest. The Pa1n2d2avas also left
<>for the village called Ekacakra1. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>147-154).
<NI>5) {%Killing of Baka and the wedding of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} While at
<>Ekacakra1 Bhi1ma killed the Ra1ks2asa called Baka and
<>freed the people of the village from their distress.
<>Afterwards the Pa1n2d2avas attended the Svayamvara
<>(free choice of the husband by woman) of Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>who became their wife. There Bhi1ma defeated S4alya
<>in fight. And, the Pa1n2d2avas duly returned to Hastina1-
<>pura. (For details see Baka, Pa1n5ca1li1 and Arjuna).
<NI>6) {%Again to forest.%} On their return to Hastinapura the
<>Pa1n2d2avas took their residence in the palace built by
<>Maya. There Maya presented a magnificent club to
<>Bhi1ma. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3, Verse 18). It was
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, lord of Dva1raka1 who served as the right hand
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas. Jara1sandha, who was then King of
<>Magadha fought with Kr2s2n2a eighteen times and got
<>defeated. Yet he did not yield, and at last Kr2s2n2a decided
<>to do away with him. Kr2s2n2a, Arjuna and Bhi1ma, in
<>disguise, set out for Magadha. They entered Jara1sandha's
<>palace and challenged him to a duel. Bhi1ma and Jara1-
<>sandha clashed, and at the instance of Kr2s2n2a Bhi1ma
<>rent the latter in two and threw him on the ground.
<>Though Jara1sandha was alive again, Bhi1ma rent him [Page130-a+ 61]
<>in two and threw away the two parts to two places.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 24).
<NI>The main impediments and thorns in their way thus
<>having been removed, Dharmaputra decided to perform
<>Ra1jasu1ya. Bhi1ma was deputed to conquer all the king-
<>doms in the eastern part of India. Bhi1ma achieved the
<>object and returned with great wealth to Indraprastha.
<>Though Bhi1ma got ready to kill S4is4upa1la, who alone
<>refused to acknowledge the suzerainty of Yudhis2t2hira,
<>he also yielded on the tactful advice of Bhi1s2ma. The
<>Ra1jasu1ya Yajn5a went off quite successfully. It was
<>Bhi1ma, who, after the Yajn5a was over, took Bhi1s2ma and
<>Yudhis2t2hira to Hastina1pura. Afterwards, in the contest
<>in the game of dice played between Dharmaputra and
<>Duryodhana, the Pa1n2d2avas lost everything. The Kaura-
<>vas brought Pa1n5ca1li1 into the assembly hall and attempted
<>to strip her naked in public. Bhi1ma who got enraged at
<>this shouted that the hands of Yudhis2t2hira who played
<>dice should be burnt in fire. (A1di Parva, Chapter 68,
<>Verse 6). And, Bhi1ma took then and there the terrible
<>pledge that he would, with his hands stained by blood
<>from the chest of Dus4s4a1sana, who tried to rip Pa1n5ca1li1
<>naked, tie up Pa1n5ca1li1's hair which got untied in the
<>scuffle. He also swore that he would break the thigh of
<>Duryodhana. In uncontrollable rage Bhi1ma also shouted
<>that he would turn into ashes all those who took part in
<>the game of dice. Bhi1ma took also the vow that all the
<>Kauravas would be killed.
<NI>According to the terms and conditions laid down with
<>regard to the contest in the game of dice the Pa1n2d2avas
<>went into the Ka1myaka forest to live there for twelve
<>years and then to live incognito for one year.
<NI>7) {%Life in forest and life incognito.%} There lived in Ka1m-
<>yaka forest a Ra1ks2asa called Kirmi1ra, brother of Bala,
<>whom Bhi1ma had killed on an earlier occasion. Kirmi1ra,
<>who was awaiting an opportunity to avenge the murder
<>of his brother, now clashed with Bhi1ma in the forest.
<>Bhi1ma did very easily kill him. (For details see Kir-
<>mi1ra).
<NI>Thus the Pa1n2d2avas spent their days once again in the
<>Ka1myaka forest under the spiritual leadership of sage
<>Dhaumya. They thought about their lost kingdom.
<>Should they go to war against the Kauravas or should
<>they spend the rest of their lives in the exercise of dha1rmic
<>injunctions? At one time Bhi1ma advised Yudhis2t2hira
<>against war; but on another occasion he pleaded vehe-
<>mently in favour of war. It was during this time that
<>Arjuna went to the Hima1layas to please S4iva by penance
<>and get from him the Pa1s4upata1stra. (Arrow called
<>Pa1s4upata). The Pa1n2d2avas naturally got nervous and
<>upset at the rather long absence of Arjuna; Bhi1ma was
<>more anxious and sorry than the others. Then the
<>Pa1n2d2avas set out in search of Arjuna, and travelled upto
<>Mount Gandhama1dana. Then the party got so tired
<>that they could not proceed any further. Pa1n5ca1li1 fell
<>down fainting. Then Bhi1ma remembered Ghat2otkaca,
<>who appeared before his father (Bhi1ma) at once. As
<>directed by Bhi1ma Ghat2otkaca mounted the Pa1n2davas
<>on his shoulders and the journey continued. They
<>reached the A1s4rama of Narana1ra1yan2as, and rested there
<>for six days. One day the wind blowing from the north- [Page130-b+ 65]
<>east dropped near Pa1n5ca1li1 a Saugandhika flower. And,
<>Bhi1ma set out in the north-east direction to fetch saugan-
<>dhika flowers for Pa1n5ca1li1, who felt a special liking for
<>them.
<NI>Walking and walking Bhi1ma entered Kadali1vana.
<>Hanu1ma1n, his skin wrinkled and hair grey due to old
<>age, was living in this forest. He obstructed the path of
<>Bhi1ma. Hanu1ma1n awoke from sleep and raised his tail
<>with a terrific sound. Bhi1ma walked upto the place
<>whence the sound was heard.
<F>1. When raised, Hanu1ma1n's tail was as high in the sky as the flag of Indra, and produced a thunderous sound. As though the
<>mountains were vomitting through their mouth, the sound produced by the raising of the tail shook the mountains. Drowning the trumpeting of
<>excited elephants the sound reverberated all around the mountains. Hearing the sound Bhi1ma, his whole body horripilated entered the
<>forest in the direction of the sound. In the middle of Kadali1vana, on a mighty rock, Bhi1ma saw Hanu1ma1n.</F> (Vanaparva, Chapter
<>146). In the clash that ensued between Hanu1ma1n and
<>Bhi1ma the former came out victorious. Hanu1ma1n,
<>however, congratulated Bhi1ma and directed him on the
<>path to the saugandhika forest.
<NI>Bhi1masena reached the saugandhika forest, which was
<>being guarded by the Ra1ks2asas called Krodhavas4as.
<>Bhi1ma overcame them, collected the flowers and return-
<>ing with them stayed in the Badarika1s4rama with his
<>brothers and Pa1n5ca1li1. Here it was that Bhi1ma killed
<>Jat2a1sura. (For details see Jat2a1sura II).
<NI>Four years were thus spent; yet Arjuna had not returned.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas continued their journey northward.
<>On the 17th day they came to the A1s4rama of Vr2s2aparva1
<>in the Hima1layas. They were duly received by the
<>mahars2i, who directed them in their onward journey.
<>Continuing the journey they reached the A1s4rama of
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a whence, after crossing various mountain peaks
<>and still walking they reached Kubera's Alaka1puri1 when
<>a Yaks2a called Man2ima1n obstructed their further pro-
<>gress. Bhi1ma killed Man2ima1n and the other Yaks2as who
<>rushed to his support. Finally Kubera himself saw
<>Bhi1ma and blessed the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>While they were returning from Kubera's palace Bhi1ma
<>was caught by a python. But, it was really Nahus2a
<>transformed into a python on account of a curse. Bhi1ma
<>killed it and it assumed its original form as Nahus2a.
<>(See Agastya, Para 8). By this time Arjuna had obtained
<>Pa1s4upata1stra from S4iva and he duly returned to his
<>brothers, and the Pa1n2d2avas continued their journey in
<>the forest.
<NI>Meantime, knowing that the Pa1n2d2avas were put up in
<>Dvaitavana, the Kauravas started for their dwelling
<>place in a procession led by Duryodhana with the army
<>and camped nearly two furlongs away from a pool in
<>Dvaitavana. While thus camping Duryodhana clashed
<>with a Gandharva called Citrasena, who with a number
<>of his comrades came to the pool for water games,
<>and in the encounter the latter made Duryodhana
<>prisoner. Bhi1masena who witnessed the scene very much
<>laughed at Duryodhana. But, Arjuna intervened and
<>set free Duryodhana and others.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas again entered the Ka1myaka forest, and
<>it was at that time that Jayadratha abducted Pa1n5ca1li1.
<>Bhi1ma killed Kot2ika1sya who acted on behalf of Jaya-
<>dratha. (See Kot2ika1sya). Moreover Bhi1ma captured
<>Jayadratha, got his head shaved clean and declared that
<>he was a slave of Dharmaputra. It was here at Dvaita-
<>vana that Dharmadeva tested the Pa1n2d2avas, who had
<>gone to a nearby pool to fetch water; all the Pa1n2d2avas
<>except Yudhis2t2hira died at the pool, but were brought
<>back to life again. (See Dharmaputra, Para 7). The [Page131-a+ 64]
<>twelve years’ forest-life of the Pa1n2d2avas now came to
<>an end.
<NI>According to the advice of Dharmadeva the Pa1n2d2avas
<>selected the Vira1t2a palace for their life incognito, Bhi1ma-
<>sena assuming the name Vallava (Valala). And, here
<>Bhi1ma killed in a duel Ji1mu1ta, the pugilist. (See Ji1mu1ta
<>II). It was also here that Bhi1ma killed Ki1caka and the
<>Upaki1cakas. (See Ki1caka). On another occasion, at
<>the instance of Yudhis2t2hira Bhi1ma took Sudharma1, King
<>of Das4a1rn2a to Yudhis2t2hira captive; but he was later set
<>free. Next year the Pa1n2d2avas defeated Duryodhana in
<>the fight in connection with the theft of the cows of the
<>Vira1t2a King, and then they declared that their forest
<>life and life incognito were over.
<NI>8) {%Bhi1ma in the great war.%} Even after the return of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas after the forest life and life incognito the
<>Kauravas refused to give them half of the kingdom. So,
<>both the parties began preparations for war. Given here-
<>under is the main incident relating to Bhi1ma from this
<>period to the Svarga1rohan2a (going to Heaven) of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas after relinquishing the kingdom in favour of
<>Pari1ks2it, including their victory in war and the adminis-
<>tration of the country.
<NI>(1) San5jaya described to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the prowess and
<>achievements of Bhi1ma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 50).
<NI>(2) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a before leaving for the Kaurava assembly
<>for compromise talks asked for the views of Bhi1ma about
<>the whole problem, and Bhi1ma opined that peace was
<>preferable to war. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74).

<>and waxed eloquent about his heroism and prowess.

<>by S4ri1 Ra1ma in the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a war. The warriors
<>who attacked you are the asuras called ‘Sarogeyas’.”

<>by the latter. At last when Bhi1ma too was about to fall
<>down and die he asked the reason thereof, and Yudhis2-
<>t2hira replied that Bhi1ma's over-eating was the reason.
<>Afterwards when Dharmaputra entered Heaven he
<>found his brothers had already their seats there. (See

<>life with a Vais4ya woman. He was a terrible fellow, who
<>had killed many brahmins, and also enjoyed the wives
<>of many elderly people including his teachers. He was
<>a robber as well. Once he went to a brahmin house,
<>and with the object of robbing his wealth spoke to him
<>in a pathetic tone as follows:--“Respected sire, you
<>will please listen to my grievance. You appear to be kind-
<>hearted. Please give me some rice, or else I will die this
<>very moment.”
<NI>Brahmin:--“Oh hungry guest! There is no one here
<>to cook food. I shall give you daily some rice, which
<>you may cook yourself. I have neither father, mother,
<>son, brothers, wife nor any other relatives. All of them
<>are dead and gone. The unfortunate fellow that I am,
<>I am staying here alone. No servants or others here.”
<>Bhi1ma:--“Oh revered brahmin! I too am a lonely
<>person. I shall live here for ever serving you. I am a
<>S4u1dra.”
<NI>These words of Bhi1ma pleased the brahmin so much that
<>he cooked some food quickly and served the S4u1dra with
<>it. He stayed with the brahmin from that day onwards.
<>His idea was to rob the brahmin of his wealth at some
<>convenient time and get away. But, since he used to
<>pour on his head everyday the water with which the
<>brahmin's feet were washed he got redemption from all
<>his sins.
<NI>One night a thief got into the brahmin's room to steal his
<>earnings. Seeing the thief Bhi1ma rushed at him to give
<>him a good thrashing. But, the thief, in the twinkling
<>of an eye, cut off Bhi1ma's head and escaped from the
<>scene. At once there came down the attendants of Lord
<>Vis2n2u to lead Bhi1ma to Vaikun2t2ha. A divine chariot

<>got into the chariot and reached the abode of Vis2n2u.

<>Once he went to visit Brahma1 at Satyaloka. At that

<>In that pious atmosphere, a gentle breeze began to blow

<>by a curse. Gan3ga1devi begged pardon and Brahma1
<>lifted the curse and blessed her that the As2t2avasus would
<>come to the earth to be born as her sons and that after-
<>wards she could come back to Heaven. After that
<>Gan3ga1devi1 was born as a mortal woman in the world
<>under the name Gan3ga1 and she spent her days in the
<>forests near the Gan3ga1 river valleys.
<NI>In those days the ruler of the Lunar dynasty was a king
<>named Prati1pa. Having no children, he went to the
<>bank of the river Gan3ga1 and performed tapas there.
<>Gan3ga1devi1 who was moving about in the forests near-
<>by, saw the King deeply absorbed in his tapas. She
<>approached him and sat on his right thigh. She wanted
<>the King to be her husband. He explained to her that
<>the right thigh is the proper seat of a daughter-in-law [Page135-a+ 65]
<>and so she would become his son's wife in due course.
<>In course of time, Prati1pa had a son, S4antanu, born
<>to him. When S4antanu grew up into a young man, one
<>day he went for a hunt to the Gan3ga1-valley and there he
<>met Gan3ga1devi1. He fell in love with her at first sight
<>and courted her. Gan3ga1devi1 agreed to become his wife
<>on condition that he should not say anything to displease
<>her and if he violated that condition she would leave him.
<>The king accepted the condition and they became man
<>and wife.
<NI>At about that time, the wife of Dyo, one of the As2t2a-
<>vasus, happened to see the sacrificial cow of the sage
<>Vasis2t2ha and wished to have it. She expressed her
<>desire to her husband, Dyo. Dyo, with the other seven
<>vasus went and took away by force, Vasis2t2ha's cow.
<>Vasis2t2ha in his anger cursed the As2t2avasus to be born as
<>mortals. They repented and begged pardon from
<>Vasis2t2ha. The sage told them that all of them would
<>be born as the sons of Gan3ga1devi1 and all except Dyo,
<>who actually stole the cow, would return to Heaven
<>at the time of birth itself. As for Dyo, he would continue
<>to live in the world for a long time, as an adventurous
<>hero.
<NI>Gan3ga1devi1 became pregnant and gave birth to her first
<>child. She carried the child to the river Gan3ga1 and
<>threw it into the river. S4antanu who followed her up
<>to the river bank, did not say anything against her,
<>remembering his promise.
<NI>Seven children were born to her and she threw all of them
<>into the river in this way. When she gave birth to the
<>eighth child, S4antanu insisted that he would not allow
<>her to throw away that child into the river. As he had
<>violated the condition, the angry Gan3ga1devi1 left the
<>palace with her child. She named it Devavrata and
<>brought him up in the forest. The sage Vasis2t2ha and
<>Gan3ga1devi1 taught him all branches of knowledge.
<>Thirtytwo years later, the king went to the same forest
<>for hunting. He saw a handsome boy stopping the
<>flow of the river Gan3ga1. Getting interested in the boy,
<>the King approached him. But by that time he had
<>disappeared. The King prayed to Gan3ga1devi1 to give
<>back the child. She appeared with the child and after
<>handing over the child to him vanished. The king
<>returned to the palace with the child. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapters 95-100).
<NI>3) {%The name Bhi1s2ma.%} Devavrata was anointed, as
<>heir-apparent. One day King S4antanu reached the
<>forest near the Gan3ga1 river valley, for hunting. As he
<>was hunting, absorbed in the beauty of the forest scenery,
<>he felt the perfume of musk filling the air in the forest.
<>He wondered from where it could come. He went on
<>and on trying to find out the source of this smell until
<>he reached the cottage of a fisherman. The fisherman
<>had a daughter named Satyavati1. It was from her that
<>the fragrance of musk spread all around.
<F>1) Satyavati1's original name was Ka1li1. The fisherman got her from the stomach of a fish. (See the word Adrika1). Since she
<>had the smell of fish she got the name of “Matsyagandhi1.” She used to assist a fisherman in his work as a ferryman in the river Gan3ga1.
<>Once the sage Para1s4ara happened to get into her boat and he fell deeply in love with her. The sage removed the smell of fish from her and gave
<>her the perfume of musk instead. By this mystic power he created a mist at noon and under its cover, he had a sexual union with her. As
<>a result of it the child Kr2s2n2a (Vya1sa) was born. The child immediately left the mother to perform tapas in the forest after promising to
<>return to her whenever she wished for his presence. Although she gave birth to a child, Para1s4ara blessed that she would again remain a
<>virgin. The whole episode remained a secret. As usual, Satyavati1 returned to the fisherman's cottage in the evening and continued to
<>live with him. It is at this stage that S4antanu was attracted by the perfume of musk and came to the cottage where he met Satyavati1.</F> The king
<>fell in love with her at first sight. He asked the fisherman
<>to give the girl in marriage to him. But the brave fisher- [Page135-b+ 57]
<>man did not yield to the king's demand immediately.
<>He laid down several conditions, one of which was that
<>Satyavati1's sons should succeed to the throne of S4antanu.
<>The king was in a fix. Devavrata was the eldest son and
<>heir-apparent. To deny kingship to his sons would be
<>highly improper. Unable to find a solution to this diffi-
<>cult problem, the king returned to the palace, much
<>depressed and gloomy. There he avoided all company
<>and took to his bed, passing his time in sadness and
<>solitude.
<NI>When Devavrata knew about his father's condition, he
<>called the Ministers and asked them about it. They
<>told him everything in details. At once, without inform-
<>ing even his father, Devavrata went to the fisherman's
<>cottage on the bank of the river Gan3ga1 and begged for
<>Satyavati1 on behalf of his father. The fisherman repeated
<>his former condition. Devavrata agreed that Satya-
<>vati1's son shall be given the right of Kingship. The
<>fisherman pointed out that disputes were likely to arise
<>between Devavrata's sons and Satyavati1's children regar-
<>ding the right of succession to the throne. At once
<>Devavrata stood up and made a solemn pledge that he
<>would remain a bachelor for life. The fisherman gave
<>Satyavati1 to Devavrata to be taken to the King. Deva-
<>vrata took her to the palace and presented her to his
<>father. The King, when he came to know of the part
<>played by his son in the matter, rose from his bed and
<>embraced Devavrata with tears of joy and gratitude.
<>The gods showered flowers on the scene. Because he had
<>taken such a solemn oath, it was declared that hence-
<>forth he would be known by the name “BHI1S2MA”.
<>The loving father S4antanu also gave him a boon that
<>Bhi1s2ma would die only when he wished. (M.B., A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 100).
<NI>4) {%Affairs of the Kingdom in crisis.%} Two sons named
<>Vicitravi1rya and Citra1n3gada were born to Satyavati1 by
<>S4antanu, who died shortly afterwards. As desired by
<>Satyavati1, Bhi1s2ma crowned the boy Citra1n3gada as king.
<>Although Citra1n3gada's reign was a prosperous one, it
<>could not last long. Once a Gandharva named Citra1n3-
<>gada attacked him at Kuruks2etra and after a battle
<>which lasted for three years, the Gandharva Citra1n3gada
<>killed the King Citra1n3gada. It was Bhi1s2ma who per-
<>formed the funeral rites of the King Citra1n3gada. After
<>that Vicitravi1rya was crowned King.
<NI>It was at that time that the Svayam3vara of the three
<>daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1, Am3ba1, Am3bika1 and
<>Am3ba1lika1, was held. Bhi1s2ma thought that it would be
<>good if Vicitravi1rya married them. So Bhi1s2ma attended
<>that function. The presence of Bhi1s2ma who was an old
<>man, at the Svayam3vara, frightened the girls. The other
<>kings who were present, stopped him from entering
<>the place, since he had taken an oath to remain a life-
<>long bachelor. The old Bhi1s2ma stood up and spoke at
<>length about the eight different forms of marriage and
<>after defeating several kings like S4a1lva, he seized the
<>three daughters of the King of Ka1s4i and took them with [Page136-a+ 65]
<>him in his chariot to Hastina1pura. Preparations were
<>made for the marriage of Vicitravi1rya with the three
<>princesses. Then Amba1 approached Bhi1s2ma and told
<>him that she had already dedicated her heart to the king
<>of S4a1lva. Bhi1s2ma generously allowed her to return home.
<>(For the rest of Amba1's story, see the word “Amba1”.
<NI>Vicitravi1rya married Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. He ruled
<>over the country for seven years at the end of which he
<>died of consumption. The dynasty faced a crisis, as
<>there was no one to succeed him. Satyavati1 approached
<>Bhi1s2ma with a suggestion to beget children by Vicitra-
<>vi1rya's wife. But Bhi1s2ma stood firmly on his solemn oath
<>to continue as a life-long bachelor. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Verse 100-104).
<NI>5) {%Bhi1s2ma's Wire Pulling.%} After that Satyavati1 sum-
<>moned Vya1sa to Hastina1pura and sons were born
<>to Ambika1, Amba1lika1 and their maid by him. Ambika1
<>gave birth to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Amba1lika1 gave birth to
<>Pa1n2d2u and the maid gave birth to Vidura. They grew
<>up and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra married Ga1ndha1ri1 and Pa1n2d2u
<>married Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. Duryodhana and his brothers
<>were born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, while the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>born to Pa1n2d2u. Pa1n2d2u died at the S4atas4r2n3ga vana and
<>Ma1dri1 observed sati1 by jumping into his funeral pyre
<>and burning herself alive. After that, the Kauravas
<>and Pa1n2d2avas who lived in the palace at Hastina1pura,
<>split up into two blocs. When the palace made of lac
<>was destroyed by fire, the Pa1n2d2avas went into the forest
<>and came back to the country after their marriage with
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. They ruled over the country with Indraprastha
<>as their capital. In the gambling contest between
<>Dharmaputra and Duryodhana, the Pa1n2d2avas lost their
<>kingdom and everything and so they went to the forest
<>again. They lived for twelve years in the forest and spent
<>one year incognito in the palace of the King of Vira1t2a.
<>At that time the Pa1n2d2avas reappeared in the battle
<>which took place as a result of the theft of King Vira1t2a's
<>cows by the Kauravas. Duryodhana asserted that he
<>would not give so much land to the Pa1n2d2avas as to put
<>a dot with a needle. With the failure of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's
<>mediation, the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas encamped on
<>the opposite sides of the field of Kuruks2etra, preparing
<>for a grim battle.
<NI>Bhi1s2ma was the chief protagonist in all these events
<>relating to the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas. At every stage
<>in the story we see Bhi1s2ma's influence. The main events
<>in which this superman who used to give shelter to
<>Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas alike, played a decisive role,
<>are given below:--
<NI>(1) Bhi1s2ma sent a messenger to Subala, king of Ga1n-
<>dha1ra, to ask for the hand of Ga1ndha1ri1, to be married to
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 109, Verse
<>11).
<NI>(2) He went to the palace of S4alya, king of Madra and
<>secured Ma1dri1 to be married to Pa1n2d2u. (M.B. A1di Parva,

<>the daughter of Devaka. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>113, Verse 2).
<NI>(4) The Mahars2is who were the inhabitants of S4atasr2n3ga
<>told Bhi1s2ma about the birth of the Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 125, Verse 22).
<NI>(5) Bhi1s2ma offered ‘Jala1n5jali’ (worship with holy water)
<>to Pa1n2d2u at his death. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 126,
<>Verse 27). [Page136-b+ 63]
<NI>(6) He performed the death anniversary of Pa1n2d2u.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 127, Verse 1).
<NI>(7) He engaged Dron2a1ca1rya to teach archery to the
<>princes. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130, Verse 77).
<NI>(8) He burst into tears and wept bitterly on hearing that
<>Pa1n2d2avas were burnt to death in the palace of lac and
<>was about to offer them ‘Jala1n5jali’. Just then, Vidura
<>came to him and secretly informed him that the Pa1n2d2avas
<>were not dead. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 149, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tya Pa1t2ha).
<NI>(9) He advised Duryodhana to give half the kingdom to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 202).
<NI>(10) He had taken part in Dharmaputra's Ra1jasu1ya
<>Yajn5a. Dharmaputra had entrusted to Bhi1s2ma, the
<>arrangements for that yajn5a. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Verse 6).
<NI>(11) He advised Yudhis2t2hira to give the highest place of
<>honour in that yajn5a to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 36, Verse 28).
<NI>(12) Bhi1s2ma ridiculed S4is4upa1la (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>33).

<>41).
<NI>(14) Bhi1s2ma stopped Bhi1ma who rushed out to kill
<>S4is4upa1la. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 42, Verse 13).
<NI>(15) It was Bhi1s2ma who narrated the life story of S4is4u-
<>pa1la. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 43).
<NI>(16) In the battle against S4is4upa1la, Bhi1s2ma selected
<>powerful Kings to help S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 44, Verse 41).
<NI>(17) Once Bhi1s2ma asked the sage Pulastya about the
<>value and importance of pilgrimage. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 82, Verse 4).
<NI>(18) Bhi1s2ma advised Duryodhana to be on friendly
<>terms with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 253,
<>Verse 4).
<NI>(19) In the battle which was fought by Kauravas against
<>King Vira1t2a, Bhi1s2ma arranged the regiments in order,
<>after sending Duryodhana to Hastina1pura. (Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 52, Verse 16).
<NI>(20) A grim fight took place between Arjuna who went
<>to help the Vira1t2a army and Bhi1s2ma. At last, it was the
<>charioteer who removed Bhi1s2ma, (who had fallen down
<>unconscious) from the battlefield. (Vira1t2a Parva,
<>Chapter 64).
<NI>(21) When the Kauravas were contemplating to fight
<>against the Pa1n2d2avas who had returned after their
<>incognito life, Bhi1s2ma ridiculed Karn2a and praised
<>Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 21, Verse 16).
<NI>(22) At that time, he explained to Duryodhana, the
<>greatness of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 49, verse 2).
<NI>(23) Duryodhana proposed to bind the hands and feet
<>of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who was expected to come as the envoy of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Hearing this, Bhi1s2ma in great anger,
<>walked out of the council hall. (Udyoga Parva, Chap-
<>ter 88, Verse 19).
<NI>(24) Bhi1s2ma strongly advised Duryodhana to make a
<>treaty of peace with the Pa1n2d2avas. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 125, Verse 2).
<NI>(25) He declared that he would not kill the Pa1n2d2avas
<>but would kill 10,000 soldiers of the Pa1n2d2avas everyday.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 156, Verse 21). [Page137-a+ 64]
<NI>(26) As desired by Duryodhana, Bhi1s2ma declared the
<>Rathi1s and Maha1rathi1s who belonged to the Kaurava
<>side. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 165-168).
<NI>(27) Bhi1s2ma described all the Maha1rathi1s of the Pa1n2d2ava
<>side to Duryodhana. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 169-
<>172).
<NI>(28) Bhi1s2ma told Duryodhana that S4ikhan2d2i1 and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas should not be killed. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>172, Verse 20).
<NI>(29) Bhi1s2ma offered pu1ja1 to Paras4ura1ma. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 123, Verse 27).
<NI>(30) Am3ba1 who was allowed by Bhi1s2ma to marry her
<>lover, King S4a1lva, was rejected by him and returned
<>to Bhi1s2ma again. But he did not accept her. Although
<>Paras4ura1ma pleaded with him on behalf of Am3ba1,
<>Bhi1s2ma did not marry her. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>178, Verse 32).
<NI>(31) In connection with Amba1's case, a duel was fought
<>on the field of Kuruks2etra between Bhi1s2ma and Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. Bhi1s2ma started the duel after asking for the
<>permission of Paras4ura1ma. Pleased with the fight, the
<>Vasus presented to Bhi1s2ma, the Prasva1pana arrow. But
<>he did not use that arrow against Paras4ura1ma, since
<>the gods and Na1rada prevented him from doing so.
<>At the request of the gods, pitr2s and Gan3ga1devi1, Bhi1s2ma
<>stopped the fight and prostrated at the feet of Paras4u-
<>ra1ma. (Udyoga Parva, Chapters 178-185).
<NI>(32) Bhi1s2ma narrated to Duryodhana the story of Amba1

<NI>From these lines we see that Bhr2gu was born from
<>Brahma1's skin (tvak). But in M.B. A1di Parva, 5th
<>Chapter, we find another version regarding his birth.
<>In that passage we read that Bhr2gu was born from
<>“Vahni” (fire). In the light of these two statements, we
<>may examine Bhr2gu's birth.
<NI>Bhr2gu had two incarnations. The first time he was born
<>from Brahma1's skin. In course of time, the sage Bhr2gu
<>became famous. In the Daks2aya1ga, this sage was pre-
<>sent as one of the R2tviks (officiating priests). On that
<>occasion, Sati1devi1 who was in rage and grief because
<>her husband (S4iva) was not invited to the ya1ga, commit-
<>ted suicide by jumping into the sacrificial fire. Hearing
<>about this, S4iva was enraged and the monster spirits who
<>emerged from his matted locks caught hold of the
<>R2tviks. Bha1gavata caturtha skandha says that the Bhu1ta
<>named Nandi1s4vara, who emerged from S4iva's locks,
<>caught hold of Bhr2gu and killed him.
<NI>Therefore the Bhr2gu who was born from Brahma1's
<>skin must be considered as having died at Daks2aya1ga.
<>Bhr2gu was born again in Vaivasvata Manvantara.
<>This second birth was at the famous Brahmayajn5a
<>of Varun2a. He was reborn from fire, as Brahma1's son.
<>This child who was born from Brahma1's semen which
<>fell in the sacrificial fire, was brought up by Varun2a
<>and his wife Cars2an2i1. Consequently Bhr2gu is referred
<>to as “Varun2aputra” and “Cars2an2i1putra” in some
<>Pura1n2as. Since he was born at Varun2a's ya1ga he is
<>sometimes called “Va1run2i1 Bhr2gu”.
<NI>3) {%Bhr2gu Vam3s4a. (Bhr2gu family).%} Each birth of Bhr2gu
<>gave rise to a separate family. They are given below
<>separately:--First birth: Bhr2gu and his wife Khya1ti
<>had a daughter Laks2mi1 and three sons, Dha1ta1, Vidha1ta1
<>and Kavi. Maha1meru's daughters, A1yati and Niyati
<>became the wives of Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1, respectively.
<>Two sons, Pra1n2a and Mr2kan2d2u were born to those two
<>couples. Ma1rkan2d2eya was born to Mr2kan2d2u and from
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya was born Vedas4iras. Pra1n2a had a son,
<>Dyutima1n who had a son Ra1java1n. From that Ra1java1n,
<>Bhr2gu Vam3s4a multiplied. The family tree of this first
<>Bhr2gu Vam3s4a is given below:--(See Vis2n2u pura1n2a,

<C1>Ra1java1n <C2>Vedas4iras
<NI>Second Birth: The second Bhr2gu Vam3s4a is the family
<>which took its origin from the second birth of Bhr2gu
<>as the son of Varun2a. Varun2a's son, Bhr2gu married
<>the woman, Puloma1. They had six children who were,
<>Bhu1ta, Cyavana, Vajras4i1rs2a, S4uci, S4ukra, and Savana.
<>By his first wife Bhu1ta1, he had his sons, “Eka1das4a
<>Rudras” (eleven Rudras) and “Rudra Pa1rs2adas” [Page140-a+ 58]
<>(Attendants of Rudra) and by his second wife Saru1pa1
<>he had a crore of Rudras. Cyavana had two wives,
<>Sukanya1 and A1rus2i. Aurva, a son was born to A1rus2i.
<>From Aurva was born R2ci1ka, from R2ci1ka Jamadagni
<>and from Jamadagni, Paras4ura1ma. Cyavana had a
<>son, Pravati, by his wife Sukanya1. Ruru or S4unaka was
<>the son of Pravati by the Apsara1 Ghr2ta1ci1. Ruru
<>and his wife Pramadvara1 had a son, S4aunaka. S4uka,
<>the son of Bhr2gu had two sons, Can2d2a and Alarka and
<>a daughter, Devaya1ni1. This is the second Bhr2gu Vam3s4a.
<F>1) Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama Skandha says that Bhr2gu had married two daughters of Daks2a. Maha1bha1rata Anus4a1sana Parva

<>were the Asuras defeated but many of them were also
<>killed. Diti, the mother of the Asuras, with tears in her
<>eyes, complained to Bhr2gupati. Puloma1, Mother of
<>S4ukra, promised to find a remedy for this somehow.
<>She at once went to the forest and started a tapas for
<>the annihilation of the Devas. As the tapas gained
<>force, the Devas were alarmed and they sought the
<>protection of Maha1vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u used his
<>Vajra1yudha (Vajra weapon) against Bhr2gu's wife,
<>Puloma1. Under the stroke of Vajra she fell down, a
<>headless corpse. The enraged Mahars2i Bhr2gu cursed
<>Maha1vis2n2u to be born as a mortal in this world and to
<>suffer the pangs of separation from his wife. When the
<>curse was pronounced against Maha1vis2n2u, he directed
<>his weapon Cakra against the Mahars2i. Bhr2gu fied in
<>panic and at last begged pardon and prayed for shelter
<>to Maha1vis2n2u himself in the ocean of milk. Vis2n2u
<>withdrew his Cakra. Bhr2gu himself restored Puloma1
<>to life. To fulfil the condition of Bhr2gu's curse, Vis2n2u
<>agreed to incarnate in the world as S4ri1 Ra1ma, the son
<>of Das4aratha and to experience the pain of separation
<>from his wife. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>5) {%Bhr2gu kicked Vis2n2u.%} Long ago all the Mahars2is
<>joined together to perform a ya1ga on the bank of the
<>river Sarasvati1. A dispute arose among them as to who
<>was the most mighty among the Trimu1rtis. Some of
<>them voted for Brahma1, others declared that Vis2n2u
<>was more mighty than the other two, while a third
<>group stood for S4iva's superiority. They unanimously
<>elected Bhr2gu to ascertain and find out the truth of
<>the matter. [Page140-b+ 43]
<NI>Bhr2gu set out to Devaloka. First he went to Brahma1's
<>assembly. There, in the presence of Brahma1 who was
<>seated in the midst of many Munis, Bhr2gu took his seat
<>on a stool. Brahma1 was provoked by this act of disres-
<>pect. Bhr2gu left the place without a word and went to
<>S4iva's place. S4iva rose from his seat and approached
<>him to embrace and welcome him. Bhr2gu, shrank back
<>saying, “Do not touch me?” S4iva became angry and
<>was about to hit him with his trident when Pa1rvati1
<>stopped him.
<NI>Bhr2gu then turned his steps to Vaikun2t2ha, the abode of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. There he saw Maha1vis2n2u in a deep
<>slumber. Seeing Maha1vis2n2u whose task is the pre-
<>servation of the world, sleeping like an irresponsible
<>person, Bhr2gu gave him a kick on his breast. Vis2n2u
<>who sprang up suddenly, saw Bhr2gu standing before
<>him. He begged pardon of the sage. He declared that
<>he would carry Bhr2gu's footprint permanently on his
<>chest as a sign of his repentance for having shown dis-
<>respect to the Mahars2i. This foot-print still remains
<>on Vis2n2u's chest and is known by the name “S4ri1vatsa”.
<>In this way, the Munis came to the conclusion that
<>Maha1vis2n2u is the noblest of the Trimu1rtis. (Bha1gavata,
<>Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>6) {%The origin of Bhr2gu Ti1rtha.%} There is a sacred spot
<>called, “Bhr2gu Ti1rtha” on the western side of Das4a1s4va-
<>medha. It is here that Bhr2gu once offered tapas to S4iva.
<>Owing to the austerity of his tapas, his hair became
<>matted and discoloured. His body was completely
<>covered with earth heaped up by termites. When S4iva
<>was still not propitiated, Pa1rvati1 interceded with him
<>on behalf of Bhr2gu, S4iva agreed to bless Bhr2gu.
<NI>S4iva sent his bull to the place where Bhr2gu was sitting.
<>The bull in the course of its gambols broke up and des-
<>troyed the earthen covering on his body which was
<>made by the termites. Bhr2gu became angry and chased
<>the bull. But he was stunned by the sight of the bull
<>rising up to heaven through the air. A divine light
<>spread there. S4iva appeared before him and asked him
<>what boon he wanted. Bhr2gu prayed that the place
<>where he was doing tapas should become a holy spot.
<>S4iva granted his prayer and from that day, the place
<>became famous under the name “Bhr2gu Ti1rtha”. [Page141-a+ 62]
<>Brahma1 and other Devas and the Kinnaras still worship
<>this Bhr2gu Ti1rtha. All sin is removed by a mere sight
<>of this sacred Ti1rtha. Those who bathe in the holy
<>water of this place attain Heaven and they will not be

<HI>BHR2GUTUN3GA. A peak on which the sage Bhr2gu
<>performed tapas. R2ci1ka had lived there with his wife
<>and children. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 61st
<>Sarga).
<HI>BHR2N3GI1. A Mahars2i who was a devotee of S4iva. Once
<>he went to Kaila1sa and began to go round S4iva to pay
<>homage to him. But since Pa1rvati1 and S4iva were sitting
<>together as one body, he could not go round S4iva sepa-
<>rately. He did not have much reverence for Pa1rvati1.
<>So he took the form of a female beetle (Bhr2n3gi1) and
<>bored his way through a hole made in the place where
<>their bodies were united and thus went round S4iva alone.
<>Pa1rvati1 was angry at this slight shown to her and cursed
<>him to become physically weak. His legs became so
<>weak that they were unable to support his body. So
<>he prayed to S4iva again and he blessed him with a third
<>leg. In this way Bhr2n3gi1 became a Mahars2i with three
<>legs. (Mahars2is).
<HI>BHR2S4UN2D2I. A fisherman. He used to earn his living
<>by theft.
<NI>Once when the Mahar2s2i Mudgala was passing through
<>a forest, Bhr2s4un2d2i stopped him. But in the presence of
<>the Brahmanic effulgence of the Mahar2s2i, the fisherman
<>was dazed. Mudgala took pity on Bhr2s4un2d2i and advised
<>him to worship Lord Gan2es4a.
<NI>From that time Bhr2s4un2d2i gave up his evil ways, and
<>accepting the advice of Mudgala, started the worship
<>of Gan2es4a with single-minded devotion. As a result
<>of it, an elephant's trunk began to grow from the middle
<>of his forehead. Bhr2s4un2d2i who thus acquired a shape
<>closely resembling Gan2es4a, was visited by Indra, mis-
<>taking him for Gan2apati. (Gan2es4a: 1.67).
<HI>BHU1(H2). In the creation of the world, the Lord broke
<>the beginningless “An2d2a” (the primal egg or seed)
<>and from it the sound “Om3” emerged. The first sound
<>of it was “BHU1H2”; the second was “BHUVAH2”;
<>and the third was “SVAH2”. So the combination “Bhu1r
<>Bhuvah2 Svah2” was formed. Then came the most
<>adorable and superlative effulgence of the creator
<>(Savita1). That radiance dried up all water. A little of
<>the water became a highly viscous substance. This
<>viscous matter gradually solidified and became the earth.
<>Where the an2d2a originally was became the source of
<>that supreme effulgence. As it was the first radiant
<>light, it came to be called A1ditya (a1di=first). The
<>great procreator Brahma1 seemed to emerge from the
<>centre of the an2d2a. The garbhajala (the water contai-
<>ned in the an2d2a) became the oceans and rivers of the
<>world. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 43).
<HI>BHUJAKET2U. A king who fought on the side of Dur-
<>yodhana in the Bha1rata Yuddha.
<HI>BHUJAN3GA. A son of Kadru1 by Kas4yapa praja1pati.
<HI>BHUJYU. A Ra1jar2s2i (royal sage), the son of Tugra.
<>King Tugra sent his son with an army across the sea to
<>conquer the enemies in a distant island. When the boat [Page142-a+ 64]
<>in which they sailed had reached mid-ocean, it was
<>caught in a storm and wrecked. The prince and the
<>soldiers sank into the sea. At that time the prince prayed
<>to the As4vins who saved Bhujyu from drowning and
<>carried him back to the palace in boats and chariots
<>travelling through the air. This story is given in the
<>R2gveda where the adventures of As4vins are describ-
<>ed. (R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 17th Anuva1ka, 116th
<>Su1kta.).
<HI>BHU1KAMPA. (Earthquake). The cause of earth-
<>quake according to ancient belief is given below:--
<>The earth is being supported and held in its position by
<>an elephant called Viru1pa1ks2a. When he feels the burden
<>too heavy he shakes his head and earth tremors follow.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 40th Sarga).
<HI>BHU1LIN3GA(M). A bird which lived on the opposite
<>side of the Hima1layas. The cry of this bird resembles
<>“MA1 SA1HASA”.
<F>1) Ma1 Sa1hasa = Do not act rashly.</F> But this bird lived by pecking at
<>and eating the flesh between the teeth of a lion. S4is4upa1la
<>mentioned this bird as an example to illustrate that
<>Bhi1s2ma's advice was at variance with his practice.
<>The bird exhorts people not to act in a rash way (Ma1
<>Sa1hasa) and at the same time acts rashly.
<HI>BHU1MANYU I. A king who was the grandson of King
<>Dus2yanta and the son of Bharata. From Maha1bha1rata
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 19, we see that he was
<>born by the blessing of Bharadva1ja. His mother was
<>Sunanda1, daughter of Sarvasena, King of Ka1s4i. When
<>Bhu1manyu grew up, his father Bharata entrusted him
<>with the affairs of the Kingdom. Bhu1manyu had six
<>sons by his wife Pus2karin2i1; they were Diviratha, Suhotra,
<>Suhota1, Sukavi, Suyaju, and R2ci1ka. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 33, we see that he had
<>another son Suhotra by a woman Vijaya1, a Da1s4a1rha
<>maid.
<HI>BHU1MANYU II. There is another Bhu1manyu, grandson
<>of Kuru, a King of the Lunar dynasty and son of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, mentioned in Maha1 Bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Verse 59.
<HI>BHU1MANYU III. A Deva Gandharva. He partici-
<>pated in the celebrations connected with Arjuna's birth.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 91, Verse 35).
<HI>BHU1MI I. The earth.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The Pura1n2as maintain that Bhu1mi has a
<>Devi1 (goddess). The births of Bhu1mi and its basic
<>goddess are in two different ways.
<NI>The Maha1bha1rata, (Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha) says that the
<>goddess Bhu1mi was the daughter of Brahma1 and that
<>she was married by Maha1vis2n2u. The earth on which
<>we live is the Mr2tpin2d2a of which the basic deity is this
<>Bhu1midevi1. Of the many versions given in the Pura1n2as
<>regarding the origin of earth, three are given below:--
<NI>1) Long ago, towards the end of the age of floods, the
<>earth was in a liquid state. At that time, S4iva cut open
<>his thigh and let fall a drop of blood in the water.
<>It assumed the form of an “an2d2a” (egg). S4iva took that
<>an2d2a and split it. A man came out of it. From him was
<>made Nature (Prakr2ti) for the creation of the Universe.
<>One half of the broken an2d2a became sky and the other
<>half became the earth. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha-
<>lam3baka, 2nd Taran3ga).
<NI>(2) Maha1vis2n2u lay on the surface of water which spread
<>everywhere in the beginning. A lotus sprang up from [Page142-b+ 62]
<>the navel of Vis2n2u and from its top Brahma1 was born.
<>Liquid matter began to flow out of Vis2n2u's ears on both
<>sides. From it were born two Ra1ks2asas named Madhu
<>and Kait2abha. They persecuted Brahma1. Maha1vis2n2u
<>woke up and killed Madhu and Kait2abha. The thick
<>fat of these Ra1ks2asas hardened into the earth. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u (Maha1vira1t2 Purus2a)
<>spread everywhere. In every pore of that Maha1vira1t2
<>who was lying on the surface of the water, there was a
<>Brahma1n2d2a. In course of time that Vira1t2 obtained mind.
<>That mind stood connected with each of the pores
<>equally. Later from it were formed the “Pan5camaha1-
<>bhu1tas”. From their combination was formed the Bhu1ta
<>called “Maha1 Pr2thvi1”. It was cut into many pieces
<>and each of the pieces was deposited in each pore.
<>It was these Pr2thvi1 pieces which became “Bhu1mis”
<>at the time of creation. At the time of the floods, these
<>Bhu1mis sank again into those pores as before. In each
<>of these Brahma1n2d2as, there are the earth, mountains,
<>forests, oceans, the seven islands, Himava1n, Meru,
<>Sun, Moon, Stars and other planets. Also, each of
<>them has its own Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and other Devas.
<>Since all the different Bhu1mis in all the Brahma1n2d2as
<>had been formed artificially, they all perish in the floods.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) Bhu1mi Devi1 (Goddess Earth) is the wife of Maha1
<>Vis2n2u. In Vara1ha Kalpa (Age of the Pig) the Asura
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a carried the Earth and Submerged it under
<>water. At once Maha1 vis2n2u appeared in the form of a
<>Pig and lifted up the Earth on its horns. When the Earth
<>floated on the surface of water like a lotus leaf, Bhu1mi
<>Devi1 who was pleased, stood up in her charming figure.
<>Maha1vis2n2u fell in love with her and with the brilliance
<>of a crore of suns, had sexual union with her for the
<>period of one Devavars2a. It is from that time that
<>Bhu1mi Devi1 became Maha1vis2n2u's wife. As a result
<>of their union, a son named Man3gala was born to
<>them.
<NI>Ghat2es4a is the son of Man3gala. Man3gala has another
<>name, Covva. After the birth of Man3gala, at the behest
<>of Lord Vis2n2u, all people began to offer worship to
<>Bhu1midevi1. Maha1vis2n2u himself first worshipped her
<>by reciting the mantra--“Om Hri1m3-S4ri1m3-Kri1m3-Vasu-
<>dha1yai Sva1ha1”. After that this mantra became popular
<>for worshipping Bhu1midevi1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<NI>Naraka1sura was Bhu1midevi1's son by Hiran2ya1ks2a, the
<>Asura. When Hiran2ya1ks2a, in the form of a pig, carried
<>Bhu1midevi1 on his horns to Pa1ta1la, the horns came in
<>contact with Bhu1midevi1 and she became pregnant.
<>In Bha1gavata, Das4ama Skandha we read that Naraka1-
<>sura was born as the result of this contact. (See the
<>word Naraka I).
<NI>Si1ta1 was the daughter of Bhu1midevi1, born on another
<>occasion. Si1ta1 was married by the Kosala King S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. When she was abandoned by her husband,
<>she was at last accepted by Bhu1midevi1 within her own
<>self. (See the word Si1ta1).
<NI>4) {%Bhu1mi and Prahla1da.%} Since Bhu1midevi1 had been the
<>wife of the Asura Hiran2ya1ks2a she has also been called
<>the mother of the Asura clan. Hiran2ya1ks2a's brother was [Page143-a+ 61]
<>Hiran2yakas4ipu. Prahla1da, the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu,
<>was a devotee of Vis2n2u. The father did not like the son's
<>devotion to Vis2n2u. So he persecuted Prahla1da in various
<>ways. Once he threw down Prahla1da from the top of
<>a high building. At that time Bhu1mi devi1 appeared there
<>and received him in her arms. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 24).
<NI>5) {%Bhu1midevi1 and Pr2thu.%} Once the Emperor Pr2thu
<>turned Bhu1midevi1 into a cow and milched all resources
<>from her. (For details, see the word Pr2thu).
<NI>6) {%Pa1rvati1's curse.%} Once Pa1rvati1 and S4iva indulged in
<>their sexual act for many years. The earth began to
<>shake to its foundations. The gods approached S4iva
<>with a request to refrain and he agreed. S4iva's semen
<>was discharged and fell on the earth. Pa1rvati1 who was
<>angry at this, cursed Bhu1midevi1 as follows:--“You
<>Bhu1midevi1! You will assume many forms and become
<>the wife of many. Since you have prevented me from
<>giving birth to a son, no children will be born to you
<>in future.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, 36th Sarga).
<NI>7) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Naraka1sura has another name, “Bhauma”. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Chapter 38).
<NI>(2) Bhu1midevi1 prayed to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and obtained Vais2n2a-
<>va1stra for her son Naraka1sura. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 29, Verse 30).
<NI>(3) When Paras4ura1ma was carrying on the annihilation
<>of Ks2atriyas, Bhu1midevi1 induced the sage Kas4yapa to
<>entreat Paras4ura1ma to stop his massacre of Bhu1pa1las.
<>(Protectors of Bhu1mi=Ks2atriyas). (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 79, Verse 44).
<NI>(4) Once she (Bhu1midevi1) described to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>the greatness of Brahminhood. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 34, Verse 22).
<NI>(5) At another time she explained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the
<>nature of Gr2hastha1s4ramadharma, (Duties of a house-
<>holder). (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 97, Verse 5).
<NI>(6) On one occasion, when King An3ga touched her,
<>Bhu1midevi1 lost her own form and vanished. At that
<>time, Kas4yapa praja1pati paralysed her. (M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 152, Verse 2).
<NI>(7) Paras4ura1ma gifted the whole earth to the sage
<>Kas4yapa. From that time Bhu1midevi1 has been called
<>“Ka1s4yapi1” (daughter of Kas4yapa). (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 154, Verse 7).
<HI>BHU1MI II. Wife of Dhruva. This Bhu1mi devi1, the
<>daughter of S4is4uma1ra had two sons named Kalpa and
<>Vatsala, by Dhruva. (Bha1gavata, Caturtha Skanda1).

<HI>BHU1MIPA1LA. A Ks2atriya king of ancient India. He
<>was born from a portion of an Asura called Krodhavas4a.

<HI>BHUS4UN2D2A. A dispassionate and large-hearted crow.
<>The residence of this crow was a Kalpavr2ks2a standing
<>on a beautiful peak surrounded by luxuriant vegetation
<>in the north-eastern corner of Maha1meru. There were
<>numerous bird-nests on the southern branch of that
<>Kalpavr2ks2a. In one of them lived this centuries-old
<>bird.
<NI>Once when the sage Vasis2t2ha went to Devaloka, he
<>happened to hear about this crow. He went to see
<>Bhus4un2d2a in its nest. The crow recognised Vasis2t2ha
<>at once. They exchanged greetings. The sage opened
<>the conversation as follows:--“Oh, King of birds!
<>when were you born? How did you become a great
<>soul? How old are you? Have you recollections of the
<>past? Who was the prophet who suggested this residence
<>for you?”
<NI>The bird calmly replied as follows:--“If you are interes-
<>ted in hearing my past history I shall tell you. Lord
<>S4an3kara the Almighty lives in this world. He has numer-
<>ous attendant spirits. Besides these spirits who have
<>hoofs on their head, hands in the hoofs, teeth in
<>the hands and stomach in the face, and who have faces
<>resembling those of monkeys, camels, and elephants,
<>he has also hordes of Ma1tr2s in his retinue. The Ma1tr2s,
<>attended by spirits continue their dance in the presence
<>of the Lord. Mountain peaks, the sky, the different
<>worlds, deep pits, cremation grounds, etc. are their
<>haunts. Chief among these Ma1tr2s are eight sisters
<>named, Jaya1, Vijaya1, Jayanti1, Apara1hita1, Siddha1,
<>Rakta1, Alambus2a1 and Ulpala1. They have other follow-
<>ers also. Alambus2a1's vehicle is the crow named Can2d2a. [Page144-b+ 65]
<>All these Ma1tr2s assembled together on one occasion to
<>celebrate a festival in the sky. There was a display of
<>many kinds of entertainments at that time. Disputations
<>in spiritual matters, music, dancing, drinking and other
<>forms of hilarious activities were freely indulged in.
<>In another part of the sky, their vehicles were also
<>enjoying themselves with similar celebrations of drinking,
<>dancing, and merry-making. The swans who were the
<>vehicles of Bra1hmi1devi1 were dancing in one place,
<>intoxicated by drink. Can2d2a, the crow, who was Alam-
<>bus2a1's vehicle, also joined their company. Completely
<>absorbed in their delirious raptures, the intoxicated
<>swans indulged so freely in their amorous pleasures with
<>Can2d2a that they became pregnant. At last when the
<>merry-makings ended and all of them dispersed, the swans
<>became aware of their plight and informed Bra1hmi1
<>about it. The gracious goddess (Bra1hmi1) told them
<>that in their present state they were unable to discharge
<>their duties in drawing her chariot and so they were allow-
<>ed to go and enjoy themselves wherever they liked. After
<>this she entered into a trance. The swans in the fullness
<>of time, gave birth to twentyone sons. We, the twenty-
<>one brothers, are those children. We and our mothers
<>went to Bra1hmi1devi1 and offered worship to her for a
<>long time. As a result, the Devi1 woke up from her trance
<>and pleased with us, gave us her blessing. After that,
<>we went to our father (Can2d2a) and off red our devoted
<>services to him and prostrated before him and Alam-
<>bus2a1devi1. They blessed us. We asked our father to
<>suggest a most suitable place for a secluded life. This
<>Kalpa Vr2ks2a is the secluded place recommended by
<>him. We paid obeisance to our father and Alambu-
<>s2a1devi1 and came to settle down here. Many ages have
<>passed since then. Now your visit and holy presence
<>here, have liberated me from all worldly bonds and
<>ennobled my life. My twenty brothers lived for many
<>Kalpas and yugas at the end of which, convinced of the
<>meaninglessness of worldly life, renounced their bodies
<>and attained S4ivaloka.
<NI>On hearing this, Vasis2t2ha asked Bhus4un2d2a to tell him
<>more about his past life. Bhus4un2d2a resumed his story:--
<>“Long long ago, the whole earth was full of big rocks,
<>without trees, forests or mountains. After a great flood
<>the surface of the earth was covered with ashes. In
<>one caturyuga (a period equal to the length of the four
<>yugas, Kr2ta, treta1, dva1para and Kali) the earth was

<>tain ranges appeared. I have seen an age in which
<>Bra1hman2as were drunkards, S4u1dras were virtuous and
<>women of noble families committed adultery. You

<>again from fire. I can remember this earth sinking into
<>the ocean five times and Lord Vis2n2u taking the form of
<>a tortoise, lifting it up, above the water. I have seen the
<>ocean of milk being churned twelve times. I know that
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a had taken the earth three times to Pa1ta1la
<>(underworld). The Lord has incarnated six times as
<>Bha1rgava Ra1ma. Incarnation of Buddha has taken
<>place in six Kaliyugas. Tripuradahana (burning of
<>the Tripura1suras) has taken place thirty times. Daks2a
<>ya1ga was broken up twice. Lord S4iva has slain ten
<>Indras. He fought seven times with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a for the
<>sake of Ba1n2a. I also remember another epic entitled [Page145-a+ 65]
<>“Ra1ma1yan2a”, containing one lakh of verses and dealing
<>with metaphysical problems. I have seen the customs
<>of Kr2tayuga being followed in Kaliyuga and the customs
<>of Kaliyuga being followed in Kr2tayuga.”
<NI>Having heard the whole story, Vasis2t2ha gave his blessing
<>to Bhus4un2d2a and left the place. (Jn5a1na Va1sis2t2ha,
<>Bhu un2d2opa1khya1na).
<HI>BHU1TADHA1MA1. An Indra. This Indra is different
<>from the actual Indra. There is reference to this Indra
<>in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 28.
<HI>BHU1TAJYOTI. A king who was the father of Vasu and
<>son of Sumati.
<HI>BHU1TAKARMA1. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Kauravas in the battle at Kuruks2etra. He was
<>killed by S4ata1ni1ka, the son of Nakula. (M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 22, Verse 25).
<HI>BHU1TA1LAYA(M). A famous village in the pura1n2as.
<>It was a resort of thieves and robbers. Dead bodies
<>were often thrown into the river which was flowing
<>through this village. Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 129, verse 9 says that it was against S4a1stras to bathe
<>in this river.
<HI>BHU1TAMATHANA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.
<>B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 69).
<HI>BHU1TASANTA1PANA. One of the sons of Hiran2ya1ks2a.
<>(Bha1gavata, Saptama Skandha).
<HI>BHU1TAS4ARMA1. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Kauravas against the Pa1n2d2avas. He had taken his
<>position in the “Garud2avyu1ha” (name of a phalanx)
<>formed by Dron2a1ca1rya. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter
<>20, Verse 6).
<HI>BHU1TAS. (A set of beings created by Rudra).
<NI>1) {%General.%} A Ma1nava class or sect in ancient India.
<>In the Pura1n2as, this Ma1nava sect is classified into four
<>subdivisions. (1) Dharmapraja (2) I1s4varapraja (3)
<>Ka1s4yapi1yapraja (4) Pulahapraja.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} In the Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a there is the follow-
<>ing story about the birth and shape of Bhu1tas:--
<NI>Bhu1tas are one of the subdivisions of Pulaha's creations.
<>Long ago, Brahma1 asked the Rudra, Ni1lalohita, to
<>perform the function of creation. Accordingly he begot
<>thousands of Bhu1tas in the womb of his wife Sati1. All
<>the issues were the exact replica of his own figure.
<>Lean limbs, long ears, thick hanging lips, red eyes, bushy
<>eyebrows, long, pointed and protruding teeth, long nails,
<>matted dirty hair etc. were the grotesque features of
<>these Bhu1tas. These music-haters used serpents as their
<>Yajn5opavi1tas (sacred threads). These spirits who loitered
<>in S4iva's assembly were, as a rule, naked and carried
<>skulls on their heads. But at times they wore fantastic
<>dress with elephant skin. Their chief weapons were,
<>trident, bow, sword, etc.
<NI>3) {%Bhu1ta Chief.%} In the Pura1n2as, Rudra is acknowledged
<>as the Bhu1ta chief. That is why Rudra is known by such
<>names as “Bhu1tana1yaka”, “Gan2ana1yaka”, “Rudra1nu-
<>cara”, “Bhavaparis2ada” etc. But since the common
<>name Rudra is used for the ruler (king) of all the
<>Bhu1tas, Va1mana Pura1n2a declares that Rudra is not an
<>individual. Both Va1manapura1n2a and Matsyapura1n2a
<>represent Vi1rabhadra and Nandikes4vara as two Rudras
<>who are the masters of Bhu1tas. (Matsyapura1n2a 181,
<>2; Va1manapura1n2a 4, 17).
<NI>In Va1mana Pura1n2a, the number of Bhu1tas is given as
<>11 crores. S4kanda, Sa1kha, Bhairava are the chief among
<>them. Under them are innumerable Bhu1tas. Ashes [Page145-b+ 65]
<>and Khatva1m3ga etc. are their weapons. The emblem
<>on the banner is a cow or a bird. That is how the
<>Gan2ana1yakas have got the titles like “Mayu1radhvaja”,
<>“Mayu1rava1hana”. (Va1mana Pura1n2a 67, 1-23).
<NI>4) {%War with Asuras.%} In the war between S4iva and
<>Andhaka1sura, the Bhu1tas fought on the side of S4iva.
<>It was Vina1yaka, the master of the Bhu1ta hordes who
<>first came into conflict with the Asura. In that battle
<>Andhaka defeated Vina1yaka. After that, Nandi, an-
<>other leader of the Bhu1tas, attacked Andhaka jointly
<>with Vina1yaka and defeated him. At last, Andhaka
<>approached S4iva himself for protection, and S4iva received
<>him and appointed him as commander of one of his
<>hordes of Bhu1tas. It is this Andhaka1sura who later
<>became famous under the name of Bhr2n3gi.
<NI>In this way, the Bhu1tas had fought many battles with
<>the Asuras, joining the party of the Devas. But at the
<>time of Daks2a's yajn5a, they joined the party of the Asuras
<>and opposed the Devas.
<NI>Although the Bhu1tas won all the battles they fought both
<>on the side of the Devas and on the side of the Asuras,
<>in the end they had to leave north India and to come and
<>settle down in south India. By the time of Vaivasvata
<>manvantara they had already become South Indians.
<HI>BHU1TIVARMA1. A Ra1ks2asa who was the friend of
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti. (Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>BHUVANA I. A Mahar2s2i who visited Bhi1s2ma when he
<>was lying on the verge of death. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 26, Verse 81).
<HI>BHUVANA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. There is a
<>reference to him in M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 91,
<>Verse 35.).
<HI>BHUVANA II. A sana1tana Vis4vadeva. There is a
<>reference to him in M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>91, Verse 35.).
<HI>BHUVANA1. Br2haspati's sister. She was married to
<>Prabha1sa, one of the As2t2avasus. A son named Vis4va-
<>karma1 was born to them. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, 3-3-21-
<>29).
<HI>BHUVANES4A. See the word Bhadras4ravas.
<HI>BI1BHATSU. One of the ten names of Arjuna. He got
<>this name because he desisted from doing loathful acts.
<>“I will never resort to loathful deeds in war. Therefore
<>the devas and men call me Bibhatsu”. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 44, Stanza 18).
<HI>BID2A1LA. A minister of Mahis2a1sura. (Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>BID2A1LOPA1KHYA1NA. See the word D2im3d2ika.
<HI>BID2AUJAS. A son born to Aditi by the blessings of
<>Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Bhu1mika1n2d2a, Chapter 3).
<HI>BILVA. (VILVA). A devotee of Vis2n2u. There is a
<>story in Skanda Pura1n2a about Bilva who lived as a
<>Vais2n2avite first and then was converted to a S4aivite.
<NI>In the beginning Brahma1 created many things among
<>which Vilva (tree) (Crataeva religiosa) also was
<>created. Under that tree an anonymous man began to
<>live. Brahma1 gave him the name Vilva. Being pleased
<>at the behaviour and devotion of Bilva, Indra asked him
<>to turn the wheel of administration of the earth. Accep-
<>ting the offer Bilva requested Indra to give him the
<>Vajra (diamond) for the smooth running of the adminis-
<>tration of the earth. Indra told him that vajra1yudha
<>(diamond-weapon) would be at his disposal, when he
<>thought about it, if the occasion required it.
<NI>Once Kapila a S4aivite reached the palace of Bilva.
<>After a long conversation both became fast friends. One [Page146-a+ 65]
<>day there was a debate between Bilva and Kapila as to
<>whether penance or Action (doing one's duty) was
<>appreciable. In this discussion Bilva lost the equilibrium
<>of his mind and thinking of the diamond-weapon of
<>Indra cut off the head of Kapila. In Kapila there was
<>the power of penance as well as the power of S4iva. So
<>through S4iva Kapila got immortality. In the meanwhile
<>Bilva went to Vis2n2u and got a boon that every living
<>thing in the earth should fear him. But the boon was
<>futile. This was a turning point for Bilva. The mind of
<>Bilva changed to devotion for S4iva. He concentrated his
<>attention on the worship of S4ivalin3ga at the forest of
<>Maha1ka1la. One day Kapila came by that way and was
<>greeted by Bilva with honour and regard, and they
<>again became fast friends.
<HI>BILVAKA. A famous serpent born to Kas4yapa praja1-
<>pati of his wife Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Stanza 12).
<HI>BILVAKATI1RTHA. A holy place in Haradva1ra. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>25, Stanza 13 that those who bathe in this holy Bath will
<>attain heaven.
<HI>BILVAPA1N2D2URA. A serpent. The father of this serpent
<>was Kas4yapa and mother, Kadru1. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 35, Stanza 12).
<HI>BILVAPATRA. A serpent born in the family of Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 103, Stanza
<>14).
<HI>BILVATEJA. A serpent born in the family of Taks2aka.
<>This serpent was burnt to death by falling in the sacrificial
<>fire of Janamejaya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 57,
<>Stanza 9).
<HI>BINDUGA. A Bra1hman2a who lived in the village of
<>Ba1s2kala. Being a frequenter of the houses of harlots
<>and of various other mean habits, he had led his wife
<>Can5cala1 also to lead an immoral life. Once Binduga
<>called his wife and told her thus: “You may continue
<>the life of a harlot; but all the money acquired must be
<>handed over to me.” Thus they continued their lives
<>and after their death both were reborn as devils in the
<>mountain of Vindhya. In the midst of their life as devils,
<>once it chanced for Can5cala1 to hear the S4iva Pura1n2a
<>recited and she got her shape of devil changed. She
<>requested Pa1rvati1 to change the shape of her husband
<>also. Pa1rvati1 sent her attendant Tumburu to Binduga
<>to tell him the story of S4iva and thus he also got his form
<>changed. (S4iva Pura1n2a Ma1ha1tmya).
<HI>BINDUMATI1. The queen of the great King Ma1ndha1ta1.
<>Bindumati1 was the daughter of the King S4as4abindu.
<>Purukutsa and Mucukunda were the two sons born to
<>her from Ma1ndha1ta1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<HI>BINDUSARAS. A holy place famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>The following information is obtained from the Pura1n2as
<>about this holy place.
<NI>(1) Bindusaras lies on the north of the Mount Kaila1sa.
<>(Maha1bha1rata Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 2).
<NI>(2) It was at Bindusaras that Bhagi1ratha did penance
<>to bring down Gan3ga1 to the earth (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>3, Stanza 10).
<NI>(3) Devendra performed hundred sacrifices at this place.
<>(Maha1 Bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>(4) Once S4iva performed a sacrifice at Bindusaras.
<>(S4abha1 Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>(5) S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did penance here for several years to get
<>righteousness. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3, Stanza 11). [Page146-b+ 65]
<NI>(6) At this place, Maya, the asura gave Arjuna the famous
<>conch known as Devadatta and to Bhi1masena the famous
<>club of Vr2s2aparva1. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 3).
<HI>BODHA. A king. In the Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 14, Stanza 20, mention is made that this King
<>fled to South India with his brothers and relatives fearing
<>the attack of Jara1sandha.
<HI>BODHA(M). A place in ancient India. It is famous
<>in the Pura1n2as. Mention is made about this place
<>in Maha1bha1rata. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 39.
<HI>BODHA1YANA. An individual of the lineage of teachers.
<>(See the word Guruparam3para1).
<HI>BODHISATTVA. A good-natured husband generally
<>quoted in Sanskrit works. The following is the story
<>given about him in Katha1saritsa1gara, Taran3ga 9.
<NI>Once there lived a wealthy Vais4ya, who had a son named
<>Bodhisattva. When the childhood of the boy was at an
<>end his mother died. The Vais4ya married again and got
<>his son also married. Because of the ear-buzzing of his
<>wife, the Vais4ya drove his son out of the house. Bodhi-
<>sattva left the house of his father, with his wife. By
<>and by they reached a desert. Not a drop of water was to
<>be had. There was not even the shoot of a grass. It was a
<>sandy place with nothing else in sight. He walked for
<>seven days carrying his wife on his shoulders. His wife
<>grew weary and worn with hunger and thirst. Seeing
<>that she was about to die he gave her his flesh and blood.
<>The wicked woman took them and saved herself from
<>death. On the eighth day they reached the jungles of a
<>hilly place full of fruit-trees and with a river with grassy
<>banks, flowing down to the valley. With fruits and cool
<>water he appeased the hunger and thirst of his wife.
<>Then he got down to the river to take a bath. He saw
<>a man with his limbs cut off, coming afloat. Now and
<>then he was producing pitiable sounds. The kind son of
<>the Vais4ya, without minding his weakness due to fast for
<>the last seven days, swam to the man and brought him to
<>the bank of the river. He did all services possible for him.
<>Then he asked him who had cut off his limbs. He rep-
<>lied that his enemies had done so, with the intention that
<>he might die suffering severe pain for a long time. The
<>Vais4ya's son stood still for a little while. Then he took
<>his bath. With his wife he lived in the forest doing
<>penance. The wounds of the man he saved had been
<>healed. The Vais4ya's son, one day, went out to the
<>forest to gather fruits and roots for their food. At that
<>time his wife grew lustful and had coition with the man
<>without limbs. Gradually she began to dote on him. She
<>decided to kill her husband who was an impediment on
<>her way. She pretended to be ill. The Vais4ya's son began
<>to treat her. One day she took her husband to the edge of
<>a very deep well and said: “See, there is a divine herb at
<>the bottom of this well. I will be cured if I could eat it.
<>This is what a goddess told me in a dream yesternight”.
<>Hearing this her husband made a rope, and tied it to a
<>tree. Then he began to go down the well by the rope.
<>She cut the rope and the man fell into the well. There
<>was a passage from the well to the river. The current
<>took him through that passage to the river. He got out of
<>the river, and sat under a tree thinking of the wickedness
<>of women. There was a city close by. At that time the
<>King of the city was dead and there was no heir left. The
<>subjects of the city brought an elephant and said, “whom
<>ever this elephant takes and places on his back shall be
<>our king”. They sent the elephant out. The elephant [Page147-a+ 64]
<>was pleased at the virtuous character of the son of the
<>Vais4ya. So taking him, as if he was God, placed him on
<>its back and walked to the city. The people gathered
<>round him and anointed him as their King. The son of
<>the Vais4ya became King. He never even thought of
<>women who are generally fickle and wicked.
<NI>The wicked wife of the Vais4ya's son took the limbless
<>man on her shoulder and wandered about saying, “The
<>enemies of my husband have put him in this plight.
<>Because of my conjugal fidelity I carry him thus and
<>earn our daily bread. Please give us alms”. In this
<>manner she spent her days in begging. Thus wandering
<>from place to place she reached the city where the
<>Vaisya's son was the King. The people, seeing her
<>loyalty to her husband, honoured her and spoke highly
<>of her. Hearing that a very loyal wife had reached his
<>city the King sent for her. The King recognized her
<>instantly. But she did not know him. The King reminded
<>her of her deeds of the past one by one and began to
<>tease and scold her. Finally when she understood that
<>the King was her husband she was dumb-founded. The
<>amazed ministers looked at each other. The King reveal-
<>ed everything to them. The ministers disfigured her and
<>drove her away.
<HI>BODHYA. A famous teacher-priest. Once there was a
<>discussion between Nahus2a and Bodhya on Philosophy.
<>The summary of what Bodhya said is as follows:--
<NI>Before I advise others, I do it myself first. I am the tea-
<>cher of none. I take the world as my teacher. I learned
<>the lessons of harmlessness from snakes, disappointment
<>from Pin3gala the harlot, self-sacrifice from animals,
<>concentration from the archer, and loneliness from a maid
<>who is a spinster. (M.B., S4a1nti Parva, 171, 56, 61).
<NI>This hermit came to the King Yaya1ti and taught him
<>philosophy and ethics. The whole of the Chapter 171
<>of Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, comprises the exhortations
<>of this hermit, which are known by the famous name
<>Bodhya-Gi1ta1 (Song of Bodhya).
<HI>BRADHNA1S4VA. A king. Agastya once approached this
<>King to request him for some wealth. (See the word
<>Agastya).
<HI>BRAHMA1:
<NI>One of the trimu1rtis of the Hindu Pantheon. The tri-
<>mu1rtis are Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} God who is the creator of the
<>Universe. It is mentioned in the Pura1n2as that Brahma1
<>creates, Vis2n2u preserves and Paramas4iva destroys the
<>universe.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Brahma1.%} The birth of Brahma1 is from
<>the nave of Vis2n2u. It is mentioned in Devi1 Pura1n2a,
<>Skandha 1, about the birth of Brahma1 as follows:--
<>In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u lay on a banian leaf in the
<>shape of a baby and began to think, “Who am I? Who
<>created me? What for? What is my work? Where to
<>work?” and so on. At that time an ethereal voice said:--
<>“Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham3 na1nyadasti sana1ta-
<>nam”.
<F>*) Idam3 sarvam3 khalu aham eva, Sana1tanam anyad na1sti. All these are myself. Except me there is nothing eternal.</F> Maha1vis2n2u was amazed at this ethereal
<>voice. He did not know whose oracle it was. Still He
<>lay meditating upon the words. Then Maha1devi1,
<>with four hands and weapons such as S4an3kha (conch),
<>Cakra (wheel), Gada1 (club), Padma (lotus) and
<>maids who are prosperities and having worn glorious
<>clothes and ornaments, and accompanied by the S4aktis [Page147-b+ 63]
<>(powers) named Rati, Bhu1ti, Buddhi, Mati, Ki1rti,
<>Dhr2ti, Smr2ti, S4raddha1, Medha1, Svadha1, Sva1ha1, Ks2udha1,
<>Nidra1, Daya1, Gati1, Tus2t2i, Pus2t2i, Ks2ama1, Lajja1, Jr2m3bha1
<>and Tandra1, appeared before Maha1vis2n2u, who was
<>struck with wonder. Maha1devi1 said, “Oh, Vis2n2u, what
<>is there to wonder at? Every time the universe is sub-
<>jected to creation, preservation and destruction, you
<>are born thus due to the great power of the supreme
<>spirit. It seems that you have forgotten those matters.
<>Know that the supreme power is beyond qualities. We
<>are all with qualities. Your main quality is Sattva.
<>From your nave Brahma1 will be born. His attribute is
<>Rajogun2a (activity, passion or motion). From the middle
<>of the eyebrows of Brahma1, will be born Rudra, whose
<>attribute will be Ta1masagun2a (darkness). Brahma1,
<>with the power of penance, will acquire the ability of
<>creation and by his attribute of Rajogun2a will create
<>the world in the colour of blood. You will be the preserver
<>of that world. The same world will be destroyed by
<>Rudra at the end of the Kalpa (world age)”.
<NI>Accordingly from the nave of Vis2n2u a lotus grew up and
<>in that lotus flower Brahma1 took his form. The same
<>Brahmadeva did penance before Maha1vis2n2u and Jaga-
<>damba1, who were pleased at his penance and gave him
<>all the boons he wanted. After that Brahma1 began the
<>work of creation. He created with his mind the Saptars2is,
<>(seven sages) and then the Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). From them all the movables and the
<>immovables in the universe came into existence. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>In manusmr2ti, Chapter 1, the following stanza about the
<>creation of Brahma1 occurs.
<Poem>“Tadan2d2amabhavad haimam
<>Sahasra1m3s4usamaprabham3 /
<>Tasmin jajn5e svayam3 Brahma1
<>Sarvalokapita1mahah2” //</Poem>
<NI>That egg was as radiant as the Sun, with the colour of
<>gold. Brahma1 the great grandfather of everything in the
<>world took birth by himself in it.
<NI>From the supreme power, an egg fell on the water which
<>was the first creation. That egg became a germ of golden
<>colour. Creating a life, which had done penance in its
<>former births in such a way as to enable it to become
<>Brahma1, in the golden germ of the egg, the supreme power
<>entered the life that is to become Brahma1 as its inner
<>guide. That Brahma1 is known as the Pita1maha (Grand-
<>father of the manes) or Paternal grandfather of all the
<>worlds.”
<NI>Va1manapura1n2a Chapter 43 states as follows about the
<>creation of Brahma1:--
<NI>Ages before the beginning, when all the worlds with
<>everything they contained were submerged in the single
<>ocean of the great flood, the germ of living things formed
<>itself into a big egg. Brahma1 who had been inside the
<>egg went to a long sleep. The sleep continued for a
<>thousand yugas (ages) when Brahma1 woke up; as
<>Sattva gun2a (purity) was the foremost attribute of him,
<>he saw that the world was void. When the thought of
<>creation occurred in his mind Rajogun2a (activity or
<>passion) became his foremost attribute. Rajas is the
<>attribute that creates and Sattva, that which preserves.
<>At the time of destruction Tamogun2a (darkness) be-
<>comes the foremost attribute. That Bhagava1n (Supreme [Page148-a+ 64]
<>Spirit) the Purus2a (the Male creative Energy) pervades
<>over everything, in all the living worlds. That Eternal
<>Being is Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva.
<NI>Knowing that the world was lying in pure water, the
<>Bhagava1n (Supreme Being) cut the egg open. From it the
<>Om3ka1ra (the sacred syllable ‘Om’) emanated. The
<>first sound of it was ‘Bhu1h2’, the second, sound, ‘Bhuvah2’
<>and the third sound ‘Svah2’. So they came to be known
<>as “Bhu1rbhuvah2 Svah2”. Then the glorious radiance of
<>the sun was born from it and Brahma1 the grandfather of
<>the worlds originated in the centre of the egg.
<NI>3) {%Instigation to compose Ra1ma1yan2a.%} It was Brahma1 who
<>instigated Va1lmi1ki to compose the Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>A fowler of the forest tribe shot down one of a couple of
<>snipes which were carrying on love-making, on the banks
<>of the River Tamasa1. Seeing this Va1lmi1ki cursed the
<>fowler. The curse came out of the mouth of Va1lmi1ki
<>in the form of a verse,
<F>1) You forester, your life will not continue for many years since you have killed one of the couple of snipes.</F> “ma1 nis2a1da pratis2t2ha1m tvama-
<>gamah2 s4a1s4vati1h2 sama1h2, yat kraun5camithuna1dekam,
<>avadhi1h2 ka1mamohitam,” which according to hearsay,
<>is the first piece of poetry in the world. Brahma1 who
<>was attracted by the poetry came to the hermitage of
<>Va1lmi1ki and instigated him to compose the story of
<>Ra1ma in verse. It is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sarga 2, that the Ra1ma1yan2a was composed
<>thus.
<NI>4) {%Ra1van2a is given a boon.%} It was Brahma1 who made
<>Ra1van2a an ever-powerful hero. Penance was done by
<>Ra1van2a in the vicinity of the Hima1layas and Brahma1
<>appeared before him and granted him the boon that no
<>living creature except man, would kill him. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 16).
<NI>5) {%The loss of a head.%} Long ago S4iva plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. This story occurs in various pura1n2as with
<>slight changes. Two of them are given below:--
<NI>(1) In olden days, in the period of Satyayuga, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u did penance in S4vetadvi1pa (the island S4veta)
<>to obtain Eternal Bliss, being deeply engaged in the study
<>of Brahmavidya1. Brahma1 also went to another place
<>and began to do penance for the suppression of passions.
<>Both were doing severe penance. So they began to
<>walk in order to take rest from the penance. On the way
<>they met each other. One asked “who are you?” The
<>other also asked the same question. The talk ended in a
<>contest as to who was the greater of the two. Each
<>claimed himself to be the supreme power of the world.
<>Neither of them was prepared to recognize the claims
<>of the other. In the midst of this contest, a phallus,
<>extra-ordinarily bulky and fair appeared before them and
<>an ethereal voice said from the sky: “You need not
<>quarrel as to who is superior. He who reaches the extre-
<>mity of this phallus is the superior person. So both of
<>you proceed, one upwards and the other downwards
<>and find out the end.” Hearing this Vis2n2u went down-
<>wards to find out the bottom and Brahma1, upwards to
<>the top. Vis2n2u travelled for a long time and finding no
<>end thought the attempt futile and returned to the start-
<>ing point with disappointment and sat down.
<NI>Brahma1 travelled upwards for a long time and found no
<>end. On the way he saw the petal of a pan2d2a1nus flower,
<>coming down from the sky. Brahma1 took it and joyfully
<>returned and said haughtily to Vis2n2u: “See, I have
<>taken this flower from the head of the Phallus. I have [Page148-b+ 63]
<>brought this to convince you. You have been defeated.
<>So can you not admit that I am the superior?”
<>Maha1vis2n2u did not believe the words of Brahma1. So he
<>called the Pan2d2a1nus flower to him and questioned it.
<>The Pan2d2a1nus flower took false oath and witnessed in
<>favour of Brahma1, who had asked the flower before-
<>hand to be on his side. Maha1vis2n2u did not believe
<>this either and said, “Let S4iva be witness to this flower”.
<>S4iva at these words appeared before them and revealed
<>the deceit played by Brahma1 and the flower and then
<>cursed the Pan2d2a1nus flower that thenceforward it
<>should not have a place among the flowers of oblation
<>to S4iva. Then S4iva got angry and plucked off a head
<>of Brahma1. That is the skull S4iva uses for receiving
<>alms. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, S4kandha 5.)
<NI>(2) In days of old all the worlds with everything in them
<>were under water in a single ocean. The Sun, the
<>Moon, the Stars, air, fire, everything was destroyed. A
<>day of utter darkness appeared. Grass, bush all were
<>destroyed. Nothing could be seen and recognized. All
<>existents and non-existents were destroyed. Bhagava1n,
<>(Supreme Being) was sleeping continuously for so many
<>thousands of nights. At the end of the night Bhagava1n
<>assumed the attribute of Rajas (Activity) and got ready
<>for the work of creation. He, the knower of all Vedas
<>and Veda1n3gas appeared in the shape of a wonderful be-
<>ing with five faces. Another being with three eyes, matted
<>hair, a trident in one hand, and a garland of beads in the
<>other, and with darkness as its attribute took shape. That
<>being was called Purus2a (the male creative energy).
<>Then the Maha1tma1 (the Supreme Spirit) created Aham3-
<>ka1ra (Egoism). It affected Brahma1 and S4iva. Overcome
<>by egoism, S4iva said to Brahma1:--“Who are you? Who
<>created you?” Swelled with egoism Brahma1 asked in
<>reply:--“Who are you? Who are your parents? Let
<>me hear it.” This talk ended in a quarrel. The origin of
<>Bhagava1n (the Lord) was from this quarrel. Immedi-
<>ately after his birth the Lord took an unparralleled lute
<>and playing it, went up to the sky. S4iva being defeated
<>by Brahma1, bowed his head and coloured. While Para-
<>mes4vara was standing angrily thus, the fifth face told
<>him, “You, who are having three eyes and whose attri-
<>bute is darkness! look here! I will tell you all. You, who
<>wear air as garments, and ride on an ox, are the destroyer
<>of the world.” Hearing these words S4iva grew more and
<>more angry, opened his third eye and looked steadily
<>at Brahma1 to burn him. Seeing the faces shining like the
<>Sun Brahma1 said, “When you beat on water, bubbles will
<>appear. But do they have any prowess? Hearing this,
<>S4iva plucked off the head of Brahma1 with the tip of his
<>finger nails. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>5) {%Changing Vijayalaks2mi1 to Lan3ka1laks2mi1, by curse.%} Vijaya-
<>laks2mi1, one of the eight Laks2mi1s, was the treasury-
<>keeper of Brahma1. Once she became careless in dis-
<>charging her duties. Brahma1 got angry and cursed her.
<>“You go to Ra1van2a and keep his tower”. She humbly
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Brahma1 said,
<>“At the time of the incarnation of S4ri1 Ra1ma, a monkey-
<>hero named Hanuma1n will reach Lan3ka1 in search of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma's wife, whom Ra1van2a had kidnapped. You will
<>obstruct him, and he will strike you down. On that day
<>you will be absolved from the curse and you will return
<>here instantly.” Accordingly Vijayalaks2mi1 was born in [Page149-a+ 64]
<>Lan3ka1 under the name Lan3ka1laks2mi1. When Hanuma1n
<>jumped to Lan3ka1 she prevented him, and he struck her
<>down to the ground. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Brahma1 cursing the daughters of Himava1n.%} Three dau-
<>ghters named Kut2ila1, Ra1gin2i1 and Pa1rvati1 and a son
<>named Suna1bha were born to Himava1n by his wife
<>Mena1. The three daughters went to the Hima1layas for
<>penance, to get S4iva as husband. They were not even
<>six years old then. The devas saw them. The A1dityas
<>and the Vasus took Kut2ila1 who was doing penance, to
<>the world of the gods. All the gods gathered together
<>and asked Brahma1. “Oh Lord, be pleased to tell us if
<>this girl will be able to bear a son who could kill Mahis2a1-
<>sura”. Brahma1 replied. “This poor girl will not be
<>capable of bearing the radiance of S4iva. So let her go
<>away.” Kut2ila1 got angry at Brahma1 and said “Lord,
<>I will try to become fit to bear the unbearable radiance of
<>S4iva. Harken, I will do penance properly and please
<>Vis2n2u and make S4iva bow his head. I take a vow to
<>that effect.” Brahma1 became angry and told Kut2ila1,
<>“You, wicked Kut2ila1, you did not succumb to my words.
<>So by my curse you will be turned to water.”
<NI>Kut2ila1 having been cursed by Brahma1 became water
<>and began to flood the world of Brahma1. Seeing the flow
<>of water, Brahma1 made cause-ways on four sides with the
<>Vedas of R2g, Yajus, Sa1ma and Atharva. Thus being
<>tied up she stays in the world of Brahma1.
<NI>The Devas took Ra1gin2i1 also before Brahma1 and put the
<>same question. The reply of Brahma1 was the same as
<>before. She also got angry and said to Brahma1. “I will
<>do great penance so as to enable to give birth to one in
<>my family to be the killer of Mahis2a1sura.” Brahma1
<>cursed her also. “You are deliberately disobeying my
<>words which even devas won't gainsay. So you will be-
<>come the colours of the twilight.” Thus she became the
<>fast colours of the twilight, and her body was divid-
<>ed among the Pleiades. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>51).
<NI>7) {%Giving a boon to a tiger and golden colour to Pa1rvati1.%} The
<>first name of Pa1rvati1, the daughter of Himava1n was Ka1li1.
<>She was given this name (Ka1li1) because of her dark
<>complexion. After the marriage S4iva and Pa1rvati1 led a
<>household life in the golden house built by Vis4vakarma1.
<>Once S4iva called Devi1 humorously, by the name Ka1li1.
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and said to her husband. “A wound by
<>an arrow will be cured. If you cut down a tree by an
<>axe it will sprout again. A wound inflicted by hard
<>words will never be cured. The arrows of words shoot
<>out of the mouth. Those who are hit by them suffer
<>pain day and night. Wise people should not shoot them
<>at others. You have violated that principle. So my lord,
<>I am going to do intensive penance. I will endeavour to
<>create such a condition, that you may not call me by the
<>name Ka1li1 again.” Saying thus, Pa1rvati1 bowed before
<>Parames4vara and bidding good-bye she went up into the
<>air and reached the peak of Hima1layas and thought of
<>Jaya1, Vijaya1, Jayanti1 and Apara1jita1. Instantly they
<>arrived to see Ka1li1. They got permission and stayed with
<>Pa1rvati1 to attend on her.
<NI>While Pa1rvati1 was engaged in doing penance, a tiger,
<>with his weapons of tusks and claws came there from the
<>jungles of the Hima1layas. Uma1 (Pa1rvati1) was standing
<>on one leg. The tiger began to think, “I shall do it when [Page149-b+ 65]
<>it is needed”. Thinking thus it gazed at the face of Devi1
<>with staring eyes and consequently it lost one eye.
<NI>Pronouncing the word Brahma1 Devi1 did penance for a
<>hundred years. After that Brahma1, the Lord of the three
<>worlds appeared before her and said to her: “I am much
<>pleased. Your penance was flawless. Ask your boon.”
<>Ka1li1 replied, “Oh, Lotus-born! First give this tiger a
<>boon. It will please me.” Then Brahma1 gave the wonder-
<>ful tiger leadership of the Gan2as, devotion to S4iva, invin-
<>cibility and righteousness. After giving the tiger this boon
<>Brahma1 told Pa1rvati1, “Now, Ambika1, ask your boon.
<>Don't hesitate, I will grant the boon.” Then Pa1rvati1
<>asked the boon. “Brahma1, give me golden colour”.
<>Brahma1 said “Let it be so”, and disappeared. The
<>dark complexion of Pa1rvati1 disappeared. She got the
<>colour of the filament of the lotus flower. From the dis-
<>carded skin Ka1tya1yani1 was born. Then Indra appeared
<>and asked for her as a gift. Indra requested Pa1rvati1 on
<>behalf of heaven. “Let me have her. Let this Kaus4iki1
<>be my sister. Because she was born from your Kos4a,
<>(outer skin) she is Kaus4iki1, I am also Kaus4ika.” Devi1
<>gave the beautiful Kaus4iki1 to Indra. Sahasra1ks2a (Indra
<>who has thousand eyes) took her to the Vindhya moun-
<>tain; when they reached there Indra told her. “You stay
<>on this mount, honoured and revered by gods. You will
<>be known as Vindhyava1sini1 (who stays on the Vindhya).
<>He consecrated the goddess there. She was given a lion
<>as her carrier (Va1hana) “You destroy the asuras?”
<>saying so Indra returned to Heaven. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 54).
<NI>8) {%Brahma1 became river.%} Long ago in the period of
<>Ca1ks2us2a manvantara (the age of a Manu), Brahma1
<>decided to perform a sacrifice on the Sahya Mountain
<>and preparations were made for it. Brahma1 came with
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva. Bhr2gu and the other hermits took their
<>seats. Maha1vis2n2u called Svara1devi1, the wife of Brahma1.
<>But she was very slow in coming. The hermit Bhr2gu
<>said to Vis2n2u: “You yourself have gone to call Devi1.
<>But she is very slow. The auspicious moment is coming
<>to an end. So how are we to commence the rituals?”
<>“If Svara1 does not appear before the end of the stipulated
<>time we shall seat Ga1yatri1 in her place,” said Vis2n2u.
<>S4iva also agreed to it. So Bhr2gu seated Ga1yatri1 on the
<>right side of Brahma1 and the rituals were performed. By
<>then Svara1 reached the sacrificial hall. When she saw
<>that Ga1yatri was placed in her place and the rituals were
<>performed she became angry, because of her quarrel
<>with her co-wife. She called out: “Where the person to
<>whom respect is due, is not given respect and where the
<>person who ought not to be respected is given undue
<>respect, there, scarcity, death and fear will be rampant.
<>She dared to sit on the right in my place. So she will
<>grow lean and become a river which will not be seen in
<>the world. All of you will become rivers because you have
<>placed a person lower than me in my position.” Hearing
<>the curse of Svara1, Ga1yatri1 rose up trembling, and cursed
<>Svara1 also to become a river. Before Svara1 was changed
<>to a river, Brahma1 and the other gods rose up and
<>requested for absolution from the curse. Svara1 said,
<>“Gods, it is because you have not given oblations to
<>Gan2apati in the beginning of the sacrifice, that this
<>break, due to my anger, has been caused. My curse
<>cannot be futile. So each of you change to a river by
<>your portions and we, your wives, will also become rivers
<>by our portions, and flow to the west.” [Page150-a+ 65]
<NI>Thus Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara became rivers
<>with their portions. Brahma1 became the fast-flowing
<>Kukudmati1, Maha1vis2n2u changed to river Kr2s2n2a1 and
<>S4iva, the river Ven2i1. The devas also changed their
<>portions to rivers and flowed from the Sahya mountain
<>to the east and their wives changed to rivers by their
<>portions and flowed to the west. Svara1 and Ga1yatri1
<>flowed as two rivers to the west and then joined together
<>as one river called Sa1vitri1. Vis2n2u and S4iva who were
<>consecrated at the sacrifice by Brahma1 came to be called
<>Bala and Atibala (Powerful and more powerful). This is
<>the origin of the rivers in Kerala. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 113).
<NI>9) {%Brahma1 is not worshipped.%} Long ago Brahma1 and
<>Vis2n2u went to see S4iva near Himava1n. They saw a shin-
<>ing phallus there in front of them. It was of immense
<>size. One of them went downwards and the other
<>upwards to find out the end of it. Both returned without
<>reaching the top or the bottom and by penance they
<>pleased S4iva who appeared before them and asked them
<>what boon they desired. Brahma1 asked S4iva to take
<>birth as his son. S4iva did not like this and said that no-
<>body would worship Brahma1 because of his extravagant
<>desire (namely, to have S4iva as his son). Vis2n2u requested
<>that he should be made a servant at S4iva's feet. So
<>Vis2n2u incarnated as S4iva's S4akti (power). That S4akti is
<>Pa1rvati1. So Vis2n2u and Pa1rvati1 are one and the same in a
<>sense. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2halambakam3, Ta-
<>ran3ga 1).
<NI>10) {%The abode of Brahma1.%} It is said in Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 8, that the abode of Brahma1 is on the top of
<>Mount Maha1meru. There are nine towns there. Mano-
<>vati1 which is in the centre, is the town of Brahma1. Due
<>east of Manovati1 stands Amara1vati1, the town of Indra.
<>On the south-east corner there is Rajovati1 which is owned
<>by Agni (fire-god). Due south of Brahmapuri1 there is
<>the town of Sam3yamani1 which is the town of Yama (God
<>of death) On the south west corner there is the town of
<>Nirr2ti. It is named Kr2s2n2a1n5jana1. On the west there is
<>the town called S4raddha1vati1. It is the abode of God
<>Varun2a. On the north-west corner there is the town
<>called Gandhavati1 which is the abode of Bhagava1n
<>Va1yu (Wind-God). Due north to Brahmapuri1 stands the
<>town of Kubera (God of wealth). It is known by the
<>name Mahodaya. On the north east corner there is the
<>city of S4iva. It is known as Yas4ovati1.
<NI>11) {%The sons of Brahma1.%} Brahma1 is the creator of all
<>the living things in the world. Still mention is made in the
<>Pura1n2as about countless divine persons who were born
<>from the mind and body of Brahma1, directly and indi-
<>rectly. They are given below in groups.
<NI>(1) Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, and Kratu.
<>It is mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter
<>65, Stanza 10, that these six grand hermits were born
<>from the mind of Brahma1.
<NI>(2) Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 51 that these
<>two were good sons born to Brahma1.
<NI>(3) Rudra. Mention is made in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>20, that Brahma1 had a roaring son who was named
<>Rudra.
<NI>(4) Sva1yam3bhuva Manu. It occurs in Bha1gavata
<>Skandha 11, that Manu Sva1yam3bhuva was the son of
<>Brahma1.
<NI>(5) Kandarpa (Ka1madeva--Cupid). In Katha1sarit- [Page150-b+ 64]
<>sa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3baka, Taran3ga, 6, it is mentioned
<>that Cupid was born from the Egoism of Brahma1.
<NI>(6) Madhuka and Golika1. In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a, men-
<>tion is made that from the playful habit of Brahma1, a
<>giant named Madhuka and a giantess named Golika1
<>were born.
<NI>(7) Bhr2gu. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 5, Stanza 8, that the hermit Bhr2gu was the son
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>(8) Ja1m3bava1n. It is seen in Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a that
<>Ja1m3bava1n was born from the sweat of Brahma1.
<NI>(9) The Sanakas. In Bha1gavata mention is made that
<>the Sanakas (Sanaka, Sananda, Sana1tana and Sanat-
<>kuma1ra) were sons of Brahma1.
<NI>(10) In Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana Parva there is a
<>passage given as the words of Vasis2t2ha spoken to Bhr2gu,
<>about the birth of many of the sons of Brahma1. “May
<>I tell you a story I have heard long ago about the revela-
<>tion of Brahma1 of himself?
<NI>Lord Rudra took the form of Varun2a and performed a
<>sacrifice. Many hermits, all the devas, Agni and others,
<>Vas2at2k ra (Exclamation in sacrifice) which took body,
<>and all yajn5a1n3gas came to the sacrificial hall. All the
<>expedients, all the glories which are thousands in number
<>took shape and came to the sacrifice. R2gveda arrayed
<>in garments of heroism came there. All the omens, all
<>the voices, all the emotions, all the etymologies of pro-
<>nouncing Veda Su1ktas, all the svarabhaktikas, Om3ka1ra
<>(the syllable Om3) the eye of all the Vedic metres and
<>their theories, all restraints and donations, all Vedas,
<>Upanis2ads, accomplishments, Sa1vitri1, the past, the near
<>future and distant future, all these came there. The
<>Lord S4iva held everyone of them. He offered his spirit
<>by his spirit. The sacrifice took many forms and shed
<>radiances. Paramas4iva is heaven, is the sky, is the earth,
<>is the ether and the husband of the Earth, is the lord
<>of all accomplishments, is noble and the lord of radiance.
<>This Lord is lauded by the names Brahma1, S4iva, Rudra,
<>Varun2a, Agni, and Prabha1vati1. S4iva is the King of all
<>the worlds. Penances, sacrifices, vows emblazed by fast,
<>all the directions and gods of directions, Indras, celestial
<>maids, mothers of the worlds, all these assumed forms
<>and came to the sacrifice in multitudes. Everybody who
<>witnessed the sacrifice of Parames4vara, who was in the
<>form of Varun2a, was greatly pleased. Seeing the pleased
<>celestial maids standing in rows passion arose in Brahma1.
<>He had seminal discharge. A1ditya (the Sun) took the
<>earth on which the semen fell and threw it into the sacri-
<>ficial fire, which blazed furiously. Brahma1 who became
<>the offerer of oblation had discharge again. He got it in
<>the sacrificial ladle and with recitation of spells offered
<>it in the sacrificial fire as if it was ghee. The powerful
<>semen contained the three attributes of Sattva, Rajas
<>and Tamas. From the attribute of Rajas arose the
<>living world which had activity as its purpose. Radiance
<>is the quality of Sattva which entered the living and non-
<>living world. It gives light to everything. It also gives
<>the power of discrimination. From the semen offered
<>in the fire, three sons with body and the attributes of
<>demi-gods came out. The male who had originated from
<>the flame called ‘Bharjana’ became An3giras. The male
<>who originated from the burning coals became Kavi.
<>Over and above these three radiances, other radiances
<>also originated from the sacrificial fire. From the Mari1cis [Page151-a+ 65]
<>(rays) of the fire Mari1ci the father of Kas4yapa was born.
<>From the Kus4a-grass spread on the floor of the hall of
<>sacrifice, the Ba1lakhilyas were born. Atri also was
<>born from the Kus4a-grass. The noble hermits called
<>Vaikha1nasas, who have grown powerful by penance and
<>became the seat of all good qualities, were born from
<>the sacrificial ashes. From the stream of fire which are
<>the eyes of the sacrificial fire the handsome As4vins
<>were born. The rest of the Praja1patis were born from
<>the ears of the fire. From the pores of the skin of fire
<>were born the hermits, from the sweat the ‘chandas’
<>(metre of Vedas) and from might, the mind. For this
<>reason the Vedic scholars and knowers of the S4ruti and
<>those who see the superiority of Vedas, say that fire is a
<>combination of all the gods. The trees that feed the fire
<>are called Ma1sas (months), the sap of the tree is called
<>Paks2a (half of the month i.e. full moon to new moon and
<>new moon to full moon), the pith of the tree is called
<>night and day and the flames are called Muhu1rtas
<>(auspicious moments). Rudras were born from the
<>blood of fire and the golden coloured gods, the Maitras,
<>also were born from the blood of fire. From the smoke
<>of the fire, the Vasus, from the flame of the fire Rudras
<>and the A1dityas of the extreme radiance were born.
<>The planets and stars which stand in their places in
<>the sky are the charcoal of the fire. Brahma1 declared that
<>fire was Brahma1 the supreme spirit, eternal and the
<>giver of all wishes. The sinless Maha1deva, who was in
<>the form of Varun2a said, “This sacrificial fire is mine,
<>and I am the sacrificer. So the children born as the first
<>fruit of this sacrifice are mine. So Bhr2gu, An3giras and
<>Kavi are my sons, no doubt. Let everybody who moves
<>along the sky know that these three are my sons, the
<>fruit of my sacrifice.” Agni said, “These are born from
<>my organs. They had been depending on me for their
<>sustenance. So they are my sons.” Brahma1 the teacher
<>of all the worlds and the grandfather of all living beings
<>said, “They are my sons. I offered my sperm to the fire,
<>and these sons were born therefrom, How can they be
<>claimed by anybody else? Here, I am the utterer of the
<>spell and the offerer of the sperm. I am the owner of
<>the sperm. Am I not the owner of the fruit? There is no
<>contest on the point that the birth of Bhr2gu and others is
<>from the oblation of my sperm.” The Gods who heard
<>these arguments bowed their heads before Brahma1 and
<>greeting him said, “Lord Brahma1, It is not only us that
<>are born from you, but the entire world of living and
<>non-living is born from you. So let Agni and Deva in
<>the shape of Varun2a have their wishes.”
<NI>12) {%Brahma1 and the giantess Karkkat2i1.%} In days of old, a
<>ferocious giantess named Karkkat2i1 lived on the northern
<>side of the Hima1layas. Because of the hugeness of her
<>body and the scarcity of food she became famished. She
<>began to do penance for the alleviation of her hunger
<>and thirst. She stood on one leg in the Hima1laya Moun-
<>tain, fixing her eyes on the sun in the day and on the
<>Moon in the night, and the severe penance continued
<>for a thousand years. Then Brahma1 appeared before her
<>and told her that she could ask for any boon. She said
<>“I wish to become a Su1ci1 (Needle) as hard as iron, hav-
<>ing the form of disease. This is the boon I pray for,
<>Brahma1”. Brahma1 blessed her and said, “Let it be so,
<>my daughter, you shall be a su1cika1 (needle) with the
<>prefix ‘V’ that is Vis4u1cika1 (Spasmodic cholera) You
<>can eat those who eat stale food, those who are wicked, [Page151-b+ 65]
<>those who sit in places where they ought not to sit and
<>those who are hard-hearted. Enter into their bodies and
<>affect their hearts, spleens and life-breaths. Thus carry
<>out the work of destruction? You can affect both the
<>good and the bad. But good people should not be killed.

<NI>Saying these words Brahma1 disappeared. Karkkat2i1 made
<>her body smaller and smaller and finally assumed the
<>shape of a needle. After that she began her work by
<>entering the body of those who had lost their energy
<>because of illness, in the form of a needle of gout and
<>caused Cholera, and the body of those who were lean
<>and worn and weary, in the form of internal cholera.
<>Thus assuming two bodies and killing countless people
<>she travelled for a long time in the earth and the sky,
<>until she herself felt aversion to her work. When she
<>remembered her original form she loathed the needle-
<>form. Karkkat2i1 again went to the vicinity of the Hima1-
<>layas and began to do penance, which lasted for another
<>thousand years. Thus she became pure and by the
<>power of thinking, she acquired spiritual knowledge.
<>Then she wanted to be saved from the mirage of birth
<>and death, to attain which, she did penance for yet
<>another thousand years at the end of which, the highly
<>pleased Brahma1 appeared before her and said, “daugh-
<>ter Karkkat2i1, all the darkness is erased from your heart
<>and you have attained deliverance from delusion. Now
<>I will bless you according to your wish. Receive your
<>original body and walk about in the worlds eating the
<>ignorant, bad beginners, the imprudent, those who sit in
<>bad places and dwell in bad places.”
<NI>She became a giantess again, but as she had attained
<>purity of soul, she engaged herself in deep meditation
<>which was free from doubt. The meditation lasted for a
<>long time. Finally her mind waved. Then she remem-
<>bered about worldly things and felt hunger. She remem-
<>bered, “Brahma1 has ordained the wicked as my food.
<>So I shall seek them.” Thinking thus she went to a jungle
<>in the vicinity of the Hima1layas. That was the dwelling
<>place of foresters. In that dark night the King and the
<>minister of the foresters approached the place where
<>Karkkat2i1 sat. Karkkat2i1 seeing them thought, “let me
<>know first if they are good or bad.” So she decided to
<>ask them some questions.
<NI>She asked them in a voice like thunder. “Who are you?
<>Are you enlightened sages or ignorant fools? say quickly.”
<>The king of the foresters hearing this replied in a cynical
<>way. “You insignificant ghost? What is your form?
<>Where do you sit? Let us see your powerless body. Who
<>is there to fear at your sound which is like the humming
<>of a she-beetle?”
<NI>Hearing this reply Karkkat2i1 showed her tusks and lau-

<>heard the loud roaring sound of her laugh and saw her
<>huge form in the light. But those mighty heroes were
<>not at all shaken by the sound they heard or the sight
<>they witnessed. The Minister looked at her and said,
<>“Hei, Giantess? These delusions of yours will have no [Page152-a+ 65]
<>effect on us. Even if a number of mosquitoes like you
<>come before us, they will be only dry leaves before wind.
<>You are acting like this merely for food. So what is
<>your need? Tell us, we will satisfy you”.
<NI>Hearing the words of the minister Karkkat2i1 knew that
<>her might was useless before such valiant men. She
<>thought them to be sages. So she said “Hey mighty
<>heroes. Who are you? Tell me the truth”. The minister
<>said: “This the King of foresters and I am his minister.
<>We came for a night-walk to find out and punish wicked
<>people like you.”
<NI>The giantess appreciated them and said: “I am about to
<>put some questions to you. If you give me suitable ans-
<>wers you will be saved.” The King agreed. The ques-
<>tions put by her are given below in the order they were
<>asked:--
<NI>1) Inside what atom which is unit and multiple at the
<>same time, do the lakhs of universes originate and vanish
<>as bubbles in a sea?
<NI>2) What does shine as ether and non-ether?
<NI>3) What is it that is something and nothing?
<NI>4) What is it that is going and not going at the same
<>time?
<NI>5) What is it that has taken form from voidness?
<NI>6) What is it that is moving and at the same time station-
<>ary as a rock?
<NI>7) Who draws pictures in clear sky?
<NI>8) In what seed do the worlds exist as a big tree in its
<>seed?
<NI>9) From what substance can the living and non-living
<>things in the worlds, not be separated as the foam and
<>waves cannot be separated from the ocean?
<NI>10) What substance is dualism not separate from
<>(others) as fluidity from water?
<NI>The reply given by the minister to each question is given
<>below in the order of the questions.
<NI>1) Hey, Giantess: All the questions you have put be-
<>fore us encased in figurative words discernible only to
<>the Vedic sages, are concerned with the supreme Being.
<>The atom is the supreme Spirit which is beyond all
<>knowledge of the mind and the senses. As it is without
<>organs of action it is as unmanifested as the sky. And
<>inside that supreme atom which could be felt only by the
<>mind, crores and crores of bubbles of universes originate
<>and vanish due to frailty.
<NI>2) The impersonal Supreme Being, having no substance,
<>pervades everything. This Supreme Being, Brahman,
<>is pure knowledge (Jn5a1nasvaru1pa). It is the sky and the
<>non-sky.
<NI>3) As it is indescribable the Impersonal Supreme Spirit
<>is nothing, but as it is a reality it is something.
<NI>4) As it pervades everything accessible, the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit has the quality of motion. But as it has
<>no emotions and as there exists no space beyond, it is
<>motionless.
<NI>5) As it is inaccessible to others the Supreme Spirit is
<>having no existence, but as it is the essence of everything
<>that is good, it has existence.
<NI>6) The Supreme Spirit is the radiance of motion or
<>activity and as there is nothing else to be found out, that
<>is, as it doesn't know anything else it is as rigid as a
<>rock.
<NI>7) In the clear sky the Supreme Spirit draws the pictures
<>of the universe.
<NI>8) Exists in the Supreme Atom. [Page152-b+ 65]
<NI>9) As the entire visible world cannot be separated from
<>the Supreme Spirit nothing is other than the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit.
<NI>10) The differentiations of the various worlds are mere
<>appearances of the Supreme Spirit and so dualism is of the
<>same figure.
<NI>The King drew Karkkat2i1 nearer to the Impersonal
<>Supreme Spirit. He advised her not to commit slaughter.
<>She accepted the advice. The King asked her to come
<>to his palace assuming the form of a beautiful woman.
<>She asked, what could he offer to a giantess as food.
<>The King said: “You good woman, we shall find out a
<>way for that. You change yourself to a beautiful woman
<>wearing golden ornaments and stay in my palace for a
<>while. I shall arrange to gather sinners, robbers and
<>such other wicked people who are to be given capital
<>punishment, in thousands from various places, and shall
<>give them to you. You can take your original form and
<>take them all to the peaks of the Himalaya and feed on
<>them.
<NI>Gluttonous people like to eat in solitude. After having
<>eaten sumptuously, take some sleep, and a little rest in
<>meditation. When you wake up you come again and
<>take away people destined to be killed. The slaughter
<>done for the sake of righteousness is not a sin. It is said
<>to be equal to mercy. When your desire for meditation
<>is over you must come to me. If an attachment of love
<>is formed even with bad persons it is difficult to break
<>the love.”
<NI>Karkkat2i1 obeyed the King. They all reached the palace.
<>Within six days three thousand wicked persons, who
<>were sentenced to death, were brought before the King,
<>from his own country and the various dependent coun-
<>tries, and were given to Karkkat2i1. In the night she took
<>her original form, gathered all the wicked people, who
<>deserved killing and bidding good bye to the King,
<>went to the Peaks of the Hima1layas. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>13) {%Brahma1 and Haindavas.%} At the end of the day of
<>Brahma1 there was the great flood, and destroying all the
<>heavens, Brahma1 went to sleep. He woke up next morn-
<>ing and after the usual morning ablutions, prepared for
<>creation. He looked around at the sky, and saw some
<>heavens still engaged in usual activities. He was amazed
<>at this unusual occurrence. Ten Brahma1s and the count-
<>less devas (gods) under them were doing their routine
<>work. Brahma1 stared at the worlds for a long time think-
<>ing “How is it”. Then he by his divine power caused one
<>of the suns, working in a heaven, to come to him, and
<>asked him. “Who are you, shining one? How have these
<>worlds come into existence?”
<NI>The Sun said with humility. “Your sons Mari1ci and
<>others erected a beautiful shed called Suvarn2atat2am,
<>in a corner of Jam3budvi1pa in the valley below Kaila1sa.
<>A Bra1hman2a named Indu arose from that hall.
<>The Brahma1n2a who was a Vedic scholar, righteous
<>and peaceful, led the life of a house-holder with his
<>wife for a long time. But they were childless. So they
<>went to Kaila1sa and did penance to get children. They
<>entered a natural arbour which was quite silent and began
<>severe penance. S4iva appeared and said that they
<>would get children.
<NI>In course of time, ten sons were born to them. After
<>a long time, when the sons had reached manhood the
<>old parents died. The sons felt very sorry. They regarded
<>life as short and full of woe and misery. So they went for [Page153-a+ 65]
<>penance, as they had no relatives left to care for them.
<>They abstained from all the pleasures of the world and
<>reached Kaila1sa. They began to meditate upon the
<>shortness of life. “What is there which is noble in this
<>world? Is there anything except woe and misery? How
<>simple is the desire of man for greatness? One thinks
<>himself prosperous if he becomes a house-holder. The
<>head of the village is more prosperous than a house-
<>holder. The King of a dependent state is more powerful
<>than the head of a village. An independent king is far
<>more prosperous than a dependent King. When we
<>think of the state of an emperor how simple is an inde-
<>pendent king! When compared with Indra, the Lord
<>of the three worlds what is an emperor after all? But
<>there is nothing glorious in the state of Indra also as it
<>ends in a Brahmamuhu1rtta (a period in the life of
<>Brahma1). So what is there substantial and eternal?
<>“Brahma1 alone is eternal and indestructible.” said the
<>eldest brother. “Concentrate your mind and say to your-
<>self, ‘I am the supreme Being Brahma1 seated on a lotus’,
<>and meditate upon it and pray for it and knowledge of
<>Brahma1 will be conferred upon you.” They understood
<>this and thus the ten brothers became Brahma1s. There
<>are ten heavens of them. They are ten worlds in the
<>sky of mind. I am the sun who creates day and night in
<>one of them,” saying thus the Sun went away. Brahma1
<>commenced his activity. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).
<NI>14) {%The age of Brahma1.%} Forty-three crores twenty lacs
<>of human years is one four-yuga period called ‘Deva-
<>caturyuga’ (a period of four yugas of the devas or gods).
<>One thousand deva caturyugas will make one Maha1yuga
<>(great yuga) A Maha1yuga is a day time of Brahma1.
<>During the period of one Maha1yuga, that is, during
<>one day of Brahma1, fourteen Manus, one after another,
<>help Brahma1 in doing the work of creation. This is the
<>time of the seventh Manu in the present day time
<>(Kalpa) of the present Brahma1. The period of six Manus
<>are over in the present day time of the present Brahma1.
<>Vaivasvata is the present Manu. Brahma1 wakes up in
<>the morning--the beginning of a Kalpa. Those which
<>underwent destruction in the night, are created again
<>in the morning. As Brahma1 wakes up daily in the morn-
<>ing, what are the things created before, which do not
<>undergo destruction? At that time there will remain,
<>without destruction, six or twentyfour tattvas (princi-
<>ples) which are natural creations. These twenty-four
<>principles are not the creation of Brahma1. He who is
<>beyond names, He who created Brahma1 in the lotus
<>flower, created them. Brahma1 who was originated in the
<>lotus which grew from the nave of Na1ra1yan2a performs
<>the work of creation guided by these twentyfour princi-
<>ples. The work of creation performed by Brahma1 is
<>called Pratisarga (substitute creation). Everything
<>Brahma1 created in the day time will be destroyed in the
<>evening. After a day time is over there is the night time
<>and sleep for Brahma1. The life of Brahma1 is hundred
<>years, that is thirty-six thousand Brahma1 days and
<>and Brahma1 nights. At the expiry of this period the life
<>of Brahma1 will come to an end, and will dissolve in
<>Na1ra1yan2a. Thus crores and crores of Brahma1s have
<>appeared and passed away and in future also crores
<>will appear and pass away. (Bha1gavata).
<NI>15) {%The creations and substitute creations of Brahma1.%} The
<>creations performed by Brahma1 are of two kinds. The
<>first is Sarga or creation and the second is Pratisarga or [Page153-b+ 63]
<>substitute creation. In the first Kalpa when a Brahma1
<>is born from the lotus, certain creations are made and
<>the things thus originated do not undergo destruction in
<>the evening or at the end of the Kalpa. They are the
<>sarga or creation. On that day and every day of the life
<>of Brahma1 they help Brahma1 in the work of creation.
<>In a sense they could be called Praja1patis (the lords of
<>emanation). But as most of them have not left sons,
<>and for other reasons also, they are not well known by
<>that name. Only the persons mentioned here have as
<>long a life as that of Brahma1. The Sanakas, Karddama,
<>Mari1ci, Atri, An3giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, Bhr2gu,
<>Vasis2t2ha, Daks2a, Na1rada, Dharma, Adharma, Nirr2ti,
<>Sarasvati1, Ka1ma, Atharva, the Manes, Agni, Stha1n2u,
<>and Sva1yam3bhuva: these do not end at the end of a
<>Brahma1's day (or Kalpa) and will be dissolved only when
<>Brahma1 is dissolved. A Brahma1 creates in his first morn-
<>ing not only persons from Sanaka to Sva1yam3bhuva, but
<>also creations which have a history only up to the end
<>of that day, such as the lokas (worlds) of Bhu1loka,
<>Bhuvarloka and Svarloka, and minerals, plants, animals,
<>humanity etc. Sarga or creation is called Pra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i
<>(natural creation). Pratisarga or substitute creation
<>is called Apra1kr2ta Sr2s2t2i or unnatural creation. At the
<>end of the Kalpa, Sam3varttaka1gni (Fire which destroys
<>the universe) and Sam3varttaka vars2a1 (Rain which des-
<>troys the universe) will occur and all the unnatural crea-
<>tions will be destroyed. In all the morning, following
<>the first morning of a Brahma1 substitute creation takes
<>place, and they are destroyed at the end of each Kalpa
<>by Sam3varttaka1gni and Sam3varttakavars2a1. (Bha1ga-
<>vata).

<NI>(52) In almost all the Pura1n2as Brahma1 is called ‘Catur-
<>mukha’ (having four faces) and to substantiate this the
<>following story is given in the Matsyapura1n2a. Brahma1
<>created S4ataru1pa1 with half the portion of his body, and
<>accepted that bright and beautiful woman as his wife.
<>He could not bear his beautiful wife to be away from
<>his sight even for a moment. So much had he become
<>attached to her.
<NI>One day S4ataru1pa1 was walking round Brahma1. The
<>daughters born from his mind also were seated close by.
<>So he could not turn round and round and look at his
<>wife as she was moving. To solve this problem, in place
<>of one face, there arose four faces.
<NI>Once S4ataru1pa1 was walking in the air. To see her at
<>that time there arose a fifth head on the top of his matted
<>hair. It is this face that was plucked off by S4iva.
<NI>(53) Various stories occur in the pura1n2as regarding how
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1. They are
<>given below. [Page155-a+ 65]
<NI>(1) Once Brahma1 praised S4iva and pleased him and
<>asked him to become his son. S4iva did not like it. He
<>got angry and cursed, “I shall become your son. But I
<>will pluck off your fifth head.”
<NI>(2) In the beginning Brahma1 created the incarnation
<>of S4iva, called Ni1lalohita also, along with the creation
<>of worlds and everything in it. In later creations Brahma1
<>did not think of Ni1lalohita. Seeing Brahma1 carrying
<>on the work of creation forgetting him, Ni1lalohita got
<>angry and cursed Brahma1, “Your fifth head will shortly
<>be destroyed.”
<NI>(3) After Brahma1 became five-faced the brightness of
<>the devas began to decrease day by day. Seeing this the
<>conceited Brahma1 said to S4iva: “I am the first who got
<>existence in this world. So by all means I am the eldest.”
<>Hearing this S4iva got angry and plucked off the fifth
<>head of Brahma1 and threw it away. (Matsyapura1n2a,
<>183, 84-86).
<NI>When the fifth head was gone, the rest of the heads were
<>benumbed. The sweat which flowed from them was
<>thrown into the earth by Brahma1. Out of it came out
<>a horrible monster, which began to chase S4iva, who
<>caught hold of it and gave it to Vis2n2u. (Skanda, 5,
<>13, 4).
<NI>(4) In the S4iva-Rudra collections a story occurs about
<>the quarrel between S4iva and Brahma1.
<NI>Once Brahma1 fell in love with Sati1 the wife of S4iva;
<>coming to know of this S4iva tried to kill Brahma1. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u tried to pacify S4iva, but it was of no avail. S4iva
<>took away the fifth head of Brahma1 and made him ugly,
<>and consequently Brahma1 became invincible in the
<>world.
<NI>(5) Once S4iva showed his daughter Sandhya1 to Brahma1
<>who grew lustful instantly; S4iva insulted Brahma1 by
<>showing this ill-owned passion of his to his sons
<>(Brahma1's sons). As a revenge Brahma1 created Sati1
<>and insulted S4iva through Daks2a. (Skanda, 2, 2, 26).

<>Chapters 65 and 122).
<HI>BRAHMACARYA. In ancient India an ideal life was
<>considered to pass through four stages, and Brahma-
<>carya is one of the stages of life. The four stages
<>are Brahmacarya (Vedic student vowed to chastity),
<>Ga1rhasthya (married householder), Va1naprastha (forest
<>hermit) and Sannya1sa (an ascetic who has renounced
<>the world). Brahmacarya, the first stage of the four
<>is considered as the period of education. The rules and
<>conduct of a Brahmaca1ri1 are given in Manusmr2ti,
<>Chapter 2.
<NI>The brahmaca1ri1 who lives with the teacher has to obey
<>certain rules and principles. He should bathe in the
<>river at sun-rise and offer oblations to gods and manes.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 has to abstain from using honey, meat,
<>fragrance, flowers, flower of chrysanthemum (Ind.)
<>women, curd, milk, ghee, churned-curd, slaughter,
<>bath applying oil, anointing the eyes with collyrium,
<>sandals, umbrella, lust, anger, covetousness, dance,
<>music, gambling, slander, ridicule, falsehood, and
<>causing injury to others. A Brahmaca1ri1 should go to
<>bed alone. Semen should not be made to discharge
<>through lust. If seminal discharge occurs in dream he
<>should take bath early in the morning and worship the
<>Sun, pronouncing the mantra or spell ‘Punah2’ thrice.
<>The Brahmaca1ri1 should live on alms. It is the duty of
<>the brahmaca1ri1 to bring water, flower for oblation,
<>cowdung, soil and darbha (grass) for the teacher. He
<>should receive alms only from the houses of those who
<>believe in the Vedas and sacrifices. He should not go
<>to the house of his teacher or his heirs and their families
<>for alms. Provided there are no other houses he may
<>receive alms from the houses of his teacher's relatives
<>and in the absence of such houses he may approach
<>the houses of heirs to his teacher and in the absence
<>of such houses he may receive alms from the house of
<>the teacher. He should fetch ‘Camata’ (fuel chiefly
<>from butea frondosa) from a place of purity in the [Page156-a+ 65]
<>forest, as instructed in rules and dry it in the sun; in
<>the absence of which it may be got dried in a sheltered
<>place. This fuel should be put in the sacrificial fire in
<>the mornings, at noons, and in the evenings. If a healthy
<>Brahmaca1ri1 fails in doing his duties consecutively for
<>seven days it will be considered that his vow of Brahma-
<>carya is broken and then he will have to take the vow
<>of ‘Avaki1rn2i’ again. Without waiting for the order of
<>the teacher, the Brahmaca1ri1 (student) should engage
<>himself in devotion and meditation and in the service
<>of the teacher daily. When the student is before the
<>teacher he should stand with folded hands controlling
<>his body, speech, brains, sensitive organs, and mind.
<>Only when he is asked to sit, should he do so before
<>the teacher, covering the portions of his body, which
<>are to be covered, with clothes. He should rise up in
<>the morning before his teacher wakes up, and go to
<>bed only after the teacher has retired for sleep. When
<>his teacher calls him, he should not give reply lying,
<>sitting, walking, eating or looking in the opposite
<>direction. He should not gainsay the teacher. The
<>student should attend to the orders of the teacher and
<>comply with them, sitting if the teacher is sitting,
<>standing if the teacher is standing, standing back if the
<>teacher is advancing towards him, running behind if
<>he is walking, standing close by when he is facing the
<>opposite direction, folding his limbs when the teacher
<>is lying or sitting near. The student should have his
<>seat and bed one step lower than those of his teacher.
<>The student should not sit in a careless manner in
<>places where the teacher's eyes could reaeh. He should
<>not utter the name of his teacher. If anybody speaks ill
<>of his teacher he should close his ears and run away
<>from the spot. If a Brahmaca1ri1 scoffs his teacher, he
<>will be born as a donkey, and as a dog if he scorns him,
<>and as a worm if he steals the wealth of his teacher
<>and as a beetle if he becomes jealous at the greatness
<>of his teacher. When the teacher is angry the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 should not go near him. The Brahmaca1ri1 should
<>not speak unasked. A Brahmaca1ri1 could sit with his
<>teacher only when they are in a vehicle, or on a camel
<>or in a tower or on the steps or on rocks or in a boat. He
<>should consider the teacher of his teacher as his teacher.
<>He should not address his parents who visit the house
<>of the teacher, without the permission of his teacher. He
<>should respect learned men, holymen, sons of the
<>teacher and those who are born of his family, as a
<>teacher. If the wife of the teacher is of the caste of the
<>teacher, the brahmaca1ri1 should consider her as his
<>teacher. If the wife is not of the same caste the brahma-
<>ca1ri1 needs only to stand up and make obeisance to her.
<>A brahmaca1ri1 should not apply oil to the body of his
<>teacher's wife, wash her, massage her body, and comb
<>her hair. A brahmaca1ri1 may either shave his head or
<>grow matted hair. He should never be asleep at sunrise
<>or sunset. For learning Vedas etc. the student should not
<>give the teacher cows, clothes etc. as free gifts before-
<>hand. On completion of education, when the student
<>asks the teacher for permission to get married, he should
<>give the teacher what he demands. A brahmaca1ri1 who
<>has fully complied with the rules mentioned above,
<>will attain heaven after his death.

<>was born to An2uha by Kr2tvi1.
<NI>2) {%Previous birth and kingship.%} In Padmapura1n2a, Part
<>III, Chapter 10, there is a story stating how the
<>seven sons of Kaus4ika, a hermit, became fishermen by
<>a curse and how they got absolution and attainment
<>of heaven by offering oblations to the manes. The
<>story is given below. Brahmadatta was the rebirth of
<>Pitr2vartti, one of those seven sons.
<NI>In days of old there was a hermit named Kaus4ika in
<>Kuruks2etra. His seven sons, S4varu1pa, Krodhana,
<>Him3sra, Pis4una, Kavi, Va1gdus2t2a and Pitr2vartti were
<>studying under Garga, a teacher. Their deeds were as
<>bad as their names indicated. Their father died. The
<>sons were in want. There was no rain anywhere in the
<>world. These brothers had taken the milking cow of
<>their teacher Garga to the forest for grazing. They
<>decided to kill the cow of their teacher. The youngest
<>of them said, “If we kill the cow we can use it as
<>offerings to the manes, and the sin will not be visited
<>on us.” The elder brothers agreed to it. Accordingly
<>Pitr2vartti killed the cow and began sacrifice to the
<>manes. Two of the elder brothers were detailed to give
<>oblations to the devas, and three of them to offer
<>oblations to the manes. One was detailed to be the
<>guest and himself as the sacrificer. Thus remembering
<>the manes the sacrifice was completed with the neces-
<>sary rituals. In short, those seven hermits got divine
<>power and became daring wicked men and ate the cow
<>of their teacher. They told the teacher that the cow
<>was eaten by a leopard and gave him the calf.
<NI>In course of time they all died and were born again as
<>wild men in Das4apura. But because of their offerings to
<>the manes they had retained memory of their previous
<>births. So they fasted in holy baths and discarded their
<>lives before the people. They were born again as deer
<>in the mount of Ka1lan5jara. Because of the power of
<>knowledge and the penance and fast they discarded
<>the body of deer in Prapatana and got rebirth as
<>Cakrava1ka (ruddy goose) in the lake called Ma1nasa-
<>saras. In this birth their names were Sumanas, Kusuma,
<>Vasu, Citradars4i, Sudars4i, Jn5a1ta and Jn5a1napa1raga,
<>names suitable to their character. Those seven loving
<>brothers were saints by virtue of their harmony with
<>the Supreme spirit. But owing to mental disturbance
<>three of them lost their attainments. Seeing the plea-
<>sures that King An2uha of Pa1n5ca1la was enjoying by
<>his wealth, vehicles, big army and beautiful women
<>one of the Cakrava1kas, Pitr2vartti, the devoted Bra1h-
<>man2a, who being loyal to his father had performed
<>sacrifice and given offerings to the manes, desired to
<>become a king. The other two brothers seeing the
<>wealth, glory and power of the two ministers, wished
<>to become ministers. Thus Pitr2vartti was born as the
<>son of An2uha with the name Brahmadatta and the
<>other two were born as Pun2d2ari1ka and Suba1laka, sons of
<>the two ministers. Brahmadatta was anointed as King of [Page157-a+ 65]
<>Pa1n5ca1la in the great city of Ka1m3pilya. The King
<>loved his father. He was mighty and powerful. He was
<>regular in performing sacrifices and giving offerings to
<>the manes. He had the attainment of harmony with
<>the supreme spirit. He understood the thought and
<>speech of birds and animals. He married Sannati, the
<>daughter of Sudeva (Devala); she was in her former
<>birth the cow of Garga.
<NI>Once as the King was walking in the garden with his
<>wife, he saw two ants. The minute creatures, who
<>were husband and wife were engaged in a petty quar-
<>rel. The male one, with loving words, pacified the
<>female one, who instantly came close to her husband
<>and they became happy. The King felt amazed at this
<>conversation of the ants, and he laughed. Because of
<>the attainments of his previous lives, he had the power
<>to understand the language of animals, birds, etc.
<>Seeing the King laughing without any reason the queen
<>Sannati asked him why he laughed. She said that
<>there was no reason whatsoever for the king to laugh
<>just then. The King replied, “Oh, beautiful one! just
<>now there was a quarrel between a female and a male
<>ant. I heard it, That is why I laughed. There is no
<>other reason.” The queen did not believe the King.
<>She thought that the King had been scoffing her. She
<>asked him how he came to understand the language
<>of such creatures. The King could not answer her
<>question. He fasted for seven days. On the seventh
<>day Brahma1 appeared before him and told him, “The
<>King will know everything from the words of a
<>Bra1hmin, whom he would meet when he goes to walk
<>in the streets.”
<NI>Brahmadatta returned to the palace and spent the
<>night there. Next morning he started with his wife and
<>ministers, for a walk. When they left the palace they
<>saw an old Brahmin coming towards them. Seeing the
<>king the Bra1hmin recited a verse:
<Poem>“Bra1hman2as in Kuruks2etra
<>which seven as wild men in Das4apura?
<>Stags in Ka1lan5jara, ruddy geese in Ma1nasa,
<>Then, are we, now living here”.</Poem>
<NI>When the King heard this verse the memory of his
<>former births revived and he fell down in a swoon.
<NI>There is a reason why the old Bra1hmin recited the
<>verse. The Ruddy geese mentioned before took their
<>next birth as sons of a poor Bra1hmin in the same city.
<>They had the memory of their previous births. They
<>were called Dhr2tima1n, Sarvadars4i, Vidya1candra and
<>Tapodhika, names suitable to their character. The
<>Brahmin boys decided to go for penance to attain su-
<>preme bliss. Then the poor father asked them, “My dear
<>sons, what is this? You are going away leaving your
<>poor and aged father. Is that dutiful? The sons replied,
<>“We will tell you a way to earn wealth. You recite to
<>the King, to-morrow morning this verse, which we
<>will teach you now. You will get plenty of wealth.”
<>The boys taught their father this verse and then they
<>went to the forest. Their father, the old Brahmin, came
<>to the gate of the palace at Ka1m3pilya. The King was
<>Brahmadatta.
<NI>There is another story how Brahmadatta became the
<>King of this place. Long ago An2uha, the King of Pa1n5ca1la
<>did penance before Brahma1, who appeared before the
<>King and asked him what he desired. The King made
<>his request that he might have a son who should be a [Page157-b+ 64]
<>mighty hero, a learned man, a great hermit and who
<>could understand the language of all living creatures.
<>Brahma1 granted him boon and thus Brahmadatta was
<>born to An2uha. It was before this Brahmadatta that
<>the Bra1hman2a recited his verse and it was that King
<>who swooned and fell down.
<NI>The two ministers were Suba1laka the son of Ba1bhravya
<>who was the author of the Ka1mas4a1stra and Pun2d2ari1ka
<>the son of Pa1n5ca1la who propagated the science of
<>medicine. They also remembered about their former
<>births and also fell down unconscious. When they
<>recovered the King Brahmadatta and the minister
<>Subala and Pun2d2ari1ka bemoaned the loss of powers
<>they had attained before by devotion, meditation,
<>penance and sacrifice. They cried, “Fate has made us
<>desirous of the objects of our senses and we have lost our
<>harmony with the Supreme Spirit.” They repeated the
<>cry again and again and they spoke about the blessings
<>obtained by offering oblation to their manes. Brahma-
<>datta gave the old Bra1hman2a plenty of wealth and
<>several villages and sent him fully satisfied. Then he
<>anointed his capable and fully qualified son Vis2vaksena
<>as King and with his retinue retired to Ma1nasa-saras
<>for penance.
<NI>3) {%A bird as his wife when he was King.%} When Brahma-
<>datta was the King of Ka1m3pilyapura a bird named
<>Tapani1ya1 become his friend. Her head was purple
<>coloured and body black. By and by this bird became
<>his wife. A daughter named Sarvasena1 was born to
<>Brahmadatta by his bird-wife. The King had sons by
<>other wives. Tapani1ya1 would wash her child and place
<>her in the cradle early in the morning and then
<>go to the forest and fly about in the air. She would
<>return in the evening and tell the King news all over
<>the world. It went on like this for a long time.
<NI>Once, when there was nobody in the room a prince
<>took Sarvasena1 from the cage and choked her to death.
<>Tapani1ya1 returned and seeing the dead body of her
<>daughter, waited for a long time. Finally she pecked
<>out the eyes of the prince and flew away into the air.
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 20).
<HI>BRAHMADATTA II. Another King who ruled over
<>Ka1m3pilya. This King was the son of the hermit Cu1li
<>and his wife Somada1, a Gandharva woman whose
<>mother was U1rmila1. When he was ruling Ka1m3pilya,
<>Kus4ana1bha was the King of Ka1nyakubja. One hund-
<>red beautiful daughters were born to the King
<>Kus4ana1bha. One day while they were playing in the
<>jungle Va1yubhagava1n (wind-god) saw them and grew
<>lustful. But they did not yield to his request. So he got
<>angry and cursed them and they became hump-backed.
<>The King was very sorry. He presented his hundred
<>hunch-backed daughters to King Brahmadatta, who,
<>by his divine power straightened their backs. When
<>they regained their former form they became the wives
<>of Brahmadatta. This story occurs in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Sargas 32 & 33.
<HI>BRAHMADATTA III. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Bhavis2ya Parva, Chapter 104, about another Brahma-
<>datta. He was the King of Sa1lva. Though he had two
<>wives he had no children. Finally by the grace of
<>S4iva two children were born to them. They were called
<>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka. (For further information see
<>D2ibhaka). [Page158-a+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMADATTA IV. A king who ruled over the coun-
<>try of Ka1s4i. One night he saw two swans flying in the
<>air. They were of golden colour. There were a num-
<>ber of swans around them. They seemed like two
<>lightnings in the midst of white clouds. Brahmadatta
<>wished to see them again. His desire increased to such
<>an extent that he had desire for nothing else. He
<>consulted his ministers and made a lake. Every crea-
<>ture which seemed beautiful to him was brought to
<>that place. Hearing this those two swans also came
<>there. By and by he tamed them and asked them how
<>they got the golden colour. The swans said thus:
<>“Oh King! you might have heard of the famous moun-
<>tain Mandara, which is the field of games of the Devas
<>(gods). At the time of the churning of the milk sea
<>when this mountain was used as churn-drill, Amr2tam3
<>(celestial nectar of immortality) touched this moun-
<>tain. So the flowers, fruits and roots in the vicinity of
<>this mountain got the power of removing death, wrin-
<>kles etc. Candracu1d2a also will come to this mountain
<>occasionally to play on the top of it and so it became
<>more glorious than the mount Kaila1sa. One day
<>while Maha1deva was playing in those gardens he had
<>to leave on an urgent matter concerning Gods. So he
<>left Pa1rvati1 there and went away. Devi1 began to walk
<>about in those gardens with pangs of separation.
<>Spring season came. The Gan2as (servants of S4iva) and
<>the maids of Pa1rvati1 attended on her. One day Man2i-
<>pus2pes4vara, a Gan2a, hankered after Candralekha1,
<>daughter of Jaya1. She had been engaged in fanning
<>Pa1rvati1. Both were young and their figures suited each
<>other. Candralekha1 reciprocated his love. Under-
<>standing this Pin3ges4vara and Guhes4vara, two gan2as
<>looked at each other and smiled. Seeing this Devi1
<>looked round with anger to see what caused them to
<>smile. They squinted their eyes and showed Manipus2-
<>pe vara and Candralekha1 to Devi1. Because of separation
<>she had been much worried, weary and sad. So all
<>these affairs made her angry. She said: “It is good
<>that you behave like this when I am in this plight !
<>The two are making love. Seeing that, you are laughing.
<>May these two dotards be born on the earth and be-
<>come husband and wife there. Let you two who
<>laughed before me without humility also be born on
<>the earth, first as poor Bra1hman2as, and then as
<>Brahmaraks2as (demon friends), outcasts, robbers,
<>dogs with tails cut off and finally as various kind of
<>birds.” Thus she cursed the four of gan2as. Then a
<>gan2a named Dhu1rjat2a said to Pa1rvati1: “Devi1, this is
<>unfortunate. They have not commited any severe
<>crime.” Devi1 got angry at him and cursed him too:
<>“May you also be born on the earth as a human be-
<>ing.” After this Jaya the loved maid of Pa1rvati1 reques-
<>ted her for absolution from curse, for all. The Devi1
<>said that all of them would get absolution at the place
<>of penance of Brahma1 and other gods and would re-
<>turn here. Of these, Candralekha1 and her husband and
<>Dhu1rjat2a would be happy on the earth. The two
<>others would lead a miserable life on the earth.”
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara, Padma1vati1lam3baka, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>BRAHMADEVA. A warrior who fought on the side of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas against the Kauravas in the battle of
<>Maha1bha1rata. His duty was to protect the army in
<>the rear. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 196,
<>Stanza 25). [Page158-b+ 65]
<HI>BRAHMA1DUM3BARA. A holy place in Kuruks2etra. In
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83, Stanza 71, it
<>is said that this place is auspicious to Brahma1.
<HI>BRAHMAHATYA1. Killing a Bra1hman2a is called Brahma-
<>hatya1. In ancient India killing a Bra1hmin was consi-
<>dered to be a great sin. He, who committed this sin
<>had to build a hut in the forest and live there for a
<>period of twelve years, or make an alms-pot called
<>‘S4ivas4irodhvaja’ and wander about begging alms, to
<>purify his soul, or else to attempt to jump into a
<>blazing fire thrice with bowed head, or perform one
<>of the three sacrifices As4vamedha, Svarjit or Gosava.
<>If none of these was possible, he had to give all the
<>wealth he had to Bra1hmins well-versed in Vedas, as
<>gift. It is mentioned in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 169, that
<>if any of the vows mentioned above was performed he
<>would be absolved from the sin of Brahmahatya1.
<HI>BRAHMAJIT. A son of Ka1lanemi. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>35:38).
<HI>BRAHMAMEDHYA1. A river, famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>Mention is made about this river in Maha1bha1rata
<>Bhi1s2maparva, Chapter 9, Stanza 32.
<HI>BRA1HMAMUHU1RTA. The period of forty-eight minutes
<>before the sunrise is called Bra1hmamuhu1rta. The
<>deity of this period is Brahma1. In Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 155, it is instructed that one should wake up at
<>this period and engage in prayer and meditation.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A. (BRA1HMIN).
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} Bra1hman2as, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas, and S4u1dras
<>are the caturvarn2as or the four castes. The Pura1n2as say
<>that the four castes originated from different parts of
<>the body of Brahma1. See Manusmr2ti, Chapter 1,
<>Stanza 87
<Poem>“Sarvasya1sya tu sargasya
<>Guptyartham3 sa maha1dyutih2
<>Mukhaba1hu1ru1pajja1na1m3
<>Pr2thakkarma1n2yakalpayat.</Poem>
<NI>(With a view to sustain the world, Brahma1 ordered acti-
<>vities, for the four castes (Bra1hman2a Ks2atriya, Vais4ya,
<>and S4u1dra) who were born from his face, arms, thighs
<>and feet). From this statement it is seen that the Bra1h-
<>man2as were born from the face, Ks2atriyas from the
<>arms, Vais4yas from the thighs and Su1dras from the feet
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>2) {%The activities of a Bra1hman2a.%} The duties of a Bra1hman2a
<>are, performing sacrifice, and encouraging others to
<>perform sacrifice, learning Vedas and teaching Vedas,
<>giving gifts and getting remuneration. A Bra1hman2a has
<>two births in one life. Till the time of investiture with
<>the sacred string is one birth and from that period on-
<>wards is the second birth. So a Bra1hman2a is called
<>‘dvija’ or twice-born.
<NI>The Bra1hman2as were allowed to do the works of agri-
<>culture, keeping cows, trade and commerce and Kusi1da
<>(money-lending). Living on the interest of money
<>giving out as loan is Kusi1da. But they should not trade
<>on products from cow, jaggery, salt, lac and flesh.
<>The suffix ‘S4arma1’ should be added to the name of
<>Bra1hman2a. A Bra1hman2a can have four wives.
<HI>BRA1HMAN2A(M). See Veda.
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2A. The word Brahma1n2d2a means the an2d2a
<>of Brahma1 (an2d2a-egg), the Supreme Being which is
<>the root of the origin of the universe. At a time long
<>ago, which is beyond reckoning, there was nothing but
<>an egg. This egg was split into two and from it a male [Page159-a+ 64]
<>child with the radiance of innumerable suns came out.
<>This wonderful child was helpless. After his birth he
<>cried for a while, because of hunger and thirst. He
<>got no help. There was nobody to feed it. So this
<>wonderful child looked up and lay there. This help-
<>less child was called ‘Vira1t2purus2a’ (the next emanation
<>from Brahma1) by those versed in the Pura1n2as. The
<>boy was so called because he was the most material
<>of materiality. But he was an atom of atoms and the
<>first figuration of God. From each pore of the skin of
<>the great vira1t2, who was the base of all the worlds a
<>universe came into being. Thus all the countless uni-
<>verses were born. Each universe has its own trinity of
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u, S4iva and devas (the bright ones), the
<>protectors of the eight zones. One universe comprises
<>fourteen worlds or realms, from Pa1ta1la to the Brahma-
<>loka (from the nether world to the upper world or
<>the realm of Brahma1). Countless such universes exist.
<>Over and above all these universes there is Vaikun2t2ha,
<>and above Vaikun2t2ha there is another world with an
<>area of fifty crore yojanas (leagues), called ‘Goloka’ (the
<>world of cow). Only the two worlds Vaikun2t2ha and
<>the Goloka are eternal. Bhu1loka (the earth) consists
<>of seven islands and sixty-four peninsulas. There are
<>seven worlds above and seven worlds below. The seven
<>upper worlds are Bhu1loka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Jana-
<>loka, Tapoloka. Satyaloka and Brahmaloka. Thus a
<>universe consists of fourteen worlds. This is the idea
<>given by the Pura1n2as about Brahma1n2d2a. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandhas 9).
<NI>Mention is made, in the Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 2,
<>Chapter 7, about the construction of Brahma1n2d2a.
<NI>This Brahma1n2d2a, like the seed of the Kapittha tree
<>(Vitar--the wood-apple), is covered under, above and
<>all around by an2d2akat2a1ha (egg-shell). The an2d2a (egg)
<>is covered by water ten times the egg in volume. This
<>water-shell is covered by a shell of fire. Around the
<>shell of fire there is the shell of air and the air-shell
<>is covered with ether. Around the shell of ether there
<>is the shell of Egoism of darkness. Over the shell of
<>Egoism there is the shell of glory and the shell of
<>glory is covered by Prakr2ti, the Divine Nature. It is
<>immeasurable. Prakr2ti contains numberless Brah-
<>ma1n2d2as. As oil exists in sesame, God pervades the whole
<>universe. This is the connection between Prakr2ti and
<>Purus2a. (The Nature and the Supreme Spirit).
<HI>BRAHMA1N2D2APURA1N2A. One of the eighteen pura1n2as.

<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The father of Br2haspati was An3giras, the
<>son of Brahma1. Brahma1 grew amorous, at the sight of
<>some celestial maids who were present at a sacrifice
<>performed by Rudra; and he had seminal flow.
<>Brahma1 put the semen in fire. From that fire the devas
<>such as Mari1ci, Bhr2gu, An3giras and others were born.
<>The name An3giras was given because he was born out
<>of an3ga1ra (live-coal). Eight sons were born to An3giras
<>by his wife Vasuda1. They were Utathya, Br2haspati,
<>Vayasya, S4a1nti, Ghora, Viru1pa, Sam3varta and Sudh-
<>anva1. All of them were sages who had attained one-
<>ness with the supreme Spirit by knowledge, and who
<>had been free from worldly pain. Of them Br2haspati,
<>Utathya and Sam3varta became famous through all
<>the worlds. In some pura1n2as Vasuda1, the mother of
<>Br2haspati, is given the name S4raddha1 also.
<NI>It is stated that Br2haspati had a sister named A1n3girasi1.
<>She was a follower of the Brahma1 cult. She became
<>the wife of Prabha1sa the last one of the eight Vasus.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 218 that the mother of Br2haspati had another name, S4ubha1, and that Br2has-
<>pati had six more brothers, born later, named Br2hatki1rti, Br2hatjyoti, Br2hadbrahma1, Br2hadmana1, Br2hadmantra, and Br2hadbha1sa and that
<>A1n3girasi1 had the name Bha1numati1 also.</F>
<>Vis4vakarma1 was her son. (Bha1gavata Skandha 4, Maha1-
<>bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 66).
<NI>2) {%Is Br2haspati the son of Agni?%} In some pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is described as the son of Agni. Its authority
<>is given below. An3giras, the father of Br2haspati was
<>once doing penance in his hermitage. When the fire of
<>penance increased the brightness of the real fire
<>decreased. Agni (fire) stood before An3giras and said
<>“Oh Lord! your brightness surpasses mine. From this
<>day onwards you are the real fire. So you shall be the
<>first fire and I will be the fire of Praja1pati which is the
<>second fire.”
<NI>Because of this boon of Agni, the devas (gods), recog-
<>nized An3giras also as a fire-god. So in some Pura1n2as
<>Br2haspati is mentioned as the son of Agni (fire-god).
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 4). [Page162-b+ 62]
<NI>3) {%Teacher of the Devas.%} The story of how Br2haspati
<>became the teacher of the devas, is given in the
<>Bha1s2a1bha1rata, Chapter 76 as shown below:
<NI>“The Suras and the asuras (the gods and the demons)
<>became enemies from time immemorial, regarding the
<>possession of wealth and prosperity in the three worlds.
<>To secure victory in the battles the gods made Br2has-
<>pati their teacher and likewise the asuras made S4ukra
<>their teacher.”
<NI>The devas and asuras began to fight for prosperity
<>and wealth. At that time the devas selected Br2haspati
<>and the asuras selected S4ukra, as their teacher.
<NI>4) {%The conjugality of Br2haspati.%} Ta1ra1 was the wife of
<>Br2haspati. She was very beautiful. Seeing Candra's
<>handsome figure she doted on him. There arose several
<>quarrels over this affair. Finally the devas intervened
<>and Ta1ra1 was given back to Br2haspati1. Budha was
<>born to Candra by Ta1ra1.
<NI>The individual called Ta1ra in the family of the monkeys,
<>was a son of Br2haspati. It is mentioned in Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 17, Stanza 10 as follows,
<>which proves this fact.
<NI>“Br2haspati begot the mighty monkey Ta1ra.” In the
<>R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 19, Su1kta 126, it is
<>mentioned that Br2haspati had a daughter named
<>Romas4a1. When her husband teased her Romas4a1 said
<>to her husband: “You please come and feel your
<>hand on my body. Don't think that my organs are
<>small. Though I am hairy like the goats of Ga1ndha1ra,
<>I have got all the organs fully grown.” This is the
<>statement in the R2gveda. In the Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>it is stated that Br2haspati had a Bra1hman2a son named
<>Kus4adhvaja, and that a daughter named Devavati1 was
<>born to Kus4adhvaja. Devavati1 was born from his
<>mouth while Kus4adhvaja was engaged in devotional
<>recitation of the Vedas. Si1ta1 was the rebirth of this
<>Devavati1. It is stated in the Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 67, Stanza 69, that Dron2a, the son of Bhara-
<>dva1ja, was born from a portion of Br2haspati. Kaca was
<>another son of Br2haspati. For full particulars of the
<>story how Devaya1ni1 (daughter of S4ukra) hankered
<>after Kaca, see ‘Kaca’. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 219, Stanza 1,
<>that Br2haspati had a wife called Ca1ndramasi1 and that
<>she gave birth to six Agnis. In Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a mention is made that Br2haspati had a
<>daughter named Sulekha1. Six sons and a daughter
<>were born to Ca1ndramasi1. The six sons were six Agnis
<>(fires): In sacrifices the burnt offerings and the ghee
<>were the portions meant for the great and mighty fire
<>S4amyu, the son of Br2haspati. It is to satisfy this great
<>fire which blazes with numberless pointed tongues, that
<>in sacrifices such as Ca1turma1sya, As4vamedha etc. ani-
<>mals are slaughtered. The daughter of Dharma was
<>the wife of S4am3yu. The name of the wonderful being
<>(S4amyu's wife) is Satya1. A son named Di1pti and three
<>daughters were born to S4amyu. The son of Di1pti is
<>Bharadva1ja who is the recipient of first portion of Ghee
<>oblated in sacrifice. On all full-moon days offerings
<>of sacrifices are meant for Bharata. Bharata had a son
<>named Bha1rata and a daughter named Bha1rati1. Bharata
<>the Agni is said to be the son of the Agni who is Praja1- [Page163-a+ 65]
<>pati Bharata. Thus Bharata got the famous name ‘the
<>great’. Bharata married Vi1ra1 and a son was born to
<>them called Vi1ra. This Vi1ra like Soma is the recipient
<>of sacrificial ghee, according to the belief of the Bra1h-
<>man2as. As this Vi1ra is the recipient of the second ghee
<>offered in sacrifice, as Soma, he is known by names
<>such as Rathaprabhu, Rathadhva1na and Kumbharetas.
<>Vi1ra married Sarayu1 and became the father of Siddhi--
<>Siddhi the Agnidevata1--who is remembered in all
<>fire songs. Fire which has no action on prosperity,
<>fame and vigour has the name Nis4cyavana. Nis4cya-
<>vana praises the earth. Satya is the son of Nis4cyavana.
<>Satya which blazes by flame determines time. Satya is
<>known by another name Nis2kr2ti. The Agni Svana
<>spreads diseases. The Agnis called Vipulaprabha, Yat-
<>a1tma1 and Brahmaca1ri are invoked in simple domestic
<>sacrifices by Bra1hman2as. The awful fire Bad2ava1gni is
<>supported by life. The sixth son of Br2haspati and Ta1ra1
<>is called S4vetakr2t. The oblation offered to this Agni
<>is known as Udadva1ra. Sva1ha1 was the daughter of
<>Ca1ndramasi1. Sva1ha1 had three sons. They are three
<>Agnis called Ka1ma1gni, Amogha, and Ukthya. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 4).
<NI>5) {%Growing amorous on the wife of elder brother.%} A story
<>stating how Br2haspati begot a son by the wife of
<>Utathya is given in Skandha 9 of Bha1gavata. Mamata1,
<>the wife of Utathya, was pregnant. Br2haspati had
<>coition with her when her husband was away. The
<>mother and the child in the womb who opposed the
<>act of Br2haspati were cursed. Mamata1 gave birth to two
<>children. Fearing that her husband might cast her out
<>she left the son of Br2haspati in the forest and was
<>about to go, when there was a divine voice from above,
<>“Mu1d2he, Bharadva1jamimam bhara dva1jam3 Br2has-
<>pate.” “You senseless woman, bring up this one born
<>of the two. Br2haspati, bring up this one born of the
<>two.” Hearing this ethereal voice Br2haspati took the
<>child and gave him the name Bharadva1ja and brought
<>him up. After that the child was given to emperor
<>Bharata. The famous archer Dron2a was the son of this
<>Bharadva1ja.
<NI>6) {%Personation of Br2haspati.%} The enmity between the
<>devas and asuras increased day by day. S4ukra1ca1rya
<>the teacher of the asuras began to do penance before
<>S4iva in the Hima1layas, with a view to get a divine
<>spell or incantation to destroy the devas. The duration
<>of the penance was thousand years. Indra came to
<>know of this secret and sent his daughter Jayanti1 to
<>get the spell from S4ukra by deceit. She stayed with
<>S4ukra as his disciple and servant. Thousand years passed
<>by. S4iva appeared before S4ukra and gave him the spell,
<>capable of destroying the devas. When he was about
<>to return Jayanti1 accepted him as her husband. Be-
<>cause of his familiarity with her, of a long standing,
<>he could not refuse her request. S4ukra told her that
<>he would become her husband, for a period of ten
<>years and that during that period both of them would
<>be invisible to the world. Thus the couple began an
<>invisible life.
<NI>Br2haspati thought of making the best use of this period.
<>He personated himself as S4ukra1ca1rya and went to the
<>Asuras, who thinking that their teacher had returned
<>after a long penance gave him a loving and sincere
<>welcome. Br2haspati sat on the seat of S4ukra1ca1rya and
<>began to exhort the asuras in such a manner that [Page163-b+ 64]
<>within the period of ten years he was able to remove
<>factionalism and hatred from them.
<NI>At the expiry of ten years' invisible life S4ukra returned
<>having sent Jayanti1 away. The asuras saw two S4ukras
<>together and were amazed. They declared that the
<>real S4ukra was he who had been teaching them for the
<>last ten years. Being dismayed at the ingratitude of the
<>asuras he cursed them that they would shortly be
<>destroyed and then left the place. At this juncture
<>Br2haspati also assumed his real form and returned to
<>heaven. Thus the asuras became a people without a
<>leader like sheep without a shepherd. At last they
<>approached their teacher S4ukra who became their
<>teacher again, when they begged for his pardon. But
<>he said that his curse could not be recalled. But he
<>gave them absolution by saying that they would regain
<>their lost power during the time of Manu Sa1varn2i.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>7) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a was returning haugh-
<>ty and proud after having defeated the devas and con-
<>quered heaven, when Sulekha1 the daughter of Br2has-
<>pati, got terrified and ran away to hide herself from
<>him. Ra1van2a chased her and when she was caught he
<>tried to ravish her. Br2haspati got angry and cursed him.
<>“You, who have grown rank by the dart of Cupid,
<>will meet with death by the dart of Ra1ma”. (Kampa
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>8) {%Br2haspati and Hanu1ma1n.%} An5jana1 the mother of
<>Hanu1ma1n was a servant of Br2haspati in her previous
<>birth. Her name then was Pun5jika1sthali1. She once went
<>to fetch water. At that time many Vidya1dhara young
<>people, both male and female, came there and engaged
<>in amorous acts. Pun5jika1sthali1 witnessed these love
<>scenes for a long time and then returned home. It is
<>mentioned in Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a that Br2haspati
<>cursed her to be born in the next birth as a female
<>monkey.
<NI>An5jana1 gave birth to Hanu1ma1n. When he grew up
<>Hanu1ma1n desired to learn Vedas and S4a1stras (scrip-
<>tures). Hanu1ma1n approached Br2haspati to learn from
<>him. But Br2haspati was not prepared to teach a monkey
<>who jumped about everywhere. The disappointed
<>Hanu1ma1n went to the Sun, who asked him how it
<>could be done by him as he was engaged in travelling
<>without stop. Hanu1ma1n said that he would move in
<>front of the sun always. Thus Hanu1ma1n who had been
<>rejected by Br2haspati became the disciple of the Sun.

<>Kings. (M.B. As4vamedha Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 8).
<NI>(10) {%Conclusion.%} Br2haspati was a deep thinker and one
<>who had firm convictions in many matters. He was a
<>man of vast knowledge. Every movement of the gods
<>had its origin in the brains of Br2haspati. There is no

<>made by Bhaspati at various times to the devas (gods)
<>or kings or hermits.

<HI>BUDHA I. Son of Candra.
<NI>1) Birth. Br2haspati the teacher-priest of the devas
<>had a very beautiful wife named Ta1ra1. One day seeing
<>the handsome figure of Candra, Ta1ra1 became amorous.
<>Candra was the Disciple of Br2haspati. It was not right
<>on the part of the wife of the teacher to feel amorous
<>towards a disciple. Br2haspati came to know of the
<>affair and sending for Candra asked him to return his
<>wife. Both Candra and Ta1ra1 did not pay any heed to
<>Br2haspati. Both sides were about to engage in a battle.
<>The devas arrayed themselves on both sides. Seeing
<>that this was not an honourable thing some devas
<>tried for a compromise. Finally Candra returned Ta1ra1
<>to Br2haspati. At this time Ta1ra1 was pregnant. Both
<>Candra and Br2haspati claimed the paternity of the
<>child in the womb of Ta1ra1, who witnessed that Candra [Page165-a+ 65]
<>was the father of the child. All accepted the words of
<>Ta1ra1. Budha was the child Ta1ra1 gave birth to.

<HI>BUDHA IV. A Bra1hman2a who lived in Gaud2ades4a.
<>Budha who was the incarnation of all vices drank too
<>much and spent a whole night lying unconscious on

<>anxious about him as he had not returned though the
<>night had advanced much. He searched everywhere
<>and finally came to the place where he was lying un-
<>conscious. He reviled the son, who getting angry
<>killed his father then and there.
<NI>After that he returned home. His mother advised him
<>to leave off his vices. His wife shed tears before him.
<>Seeing that his mother and wife were impediments
<>on his way, he put an end to their lives.
<NI>Once this Bra1hman2a carried away Sulabha1 the beauti-
<>ful wife of hermit Ka1labhu1ti and ravished her. Sulabha1
<>cursed him and made him a leper.
<NI>Budha wandered about and reached the city of King
<>S4u1rasena. On that day the King was about to go to
<>Heaven with the entire city by aeroplane. However
<>hard the pilots might try the plane would not move an
<>inch. Then the devas told the King: “Drive away
<>the leper there. The vices of that sinful murderer
<>have made the plane stationary.”
<NI>S4u1rasena who was kind and righteous, neared the leper
<>and cured him with catura1ks2ari1mantra (a spell of four
<>letters) and got ready to take him also to heaven.
<>(Gan2es4a Pura1n2a 1:76).
<HI>BUDDHA. The founder of Buddhism. Some consider
<>him to be an incarnation of Vis2n2u. In days of old in
<>a battle the devas were defeated by the asuras and the
<>gods approached Vis2n2u with their grievance. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u incarnated as the son of S4uddhodana with the [Page165-b+ 65]
<>name Gautamabuddha (Siddha1rtha). Then he went
<>to the asuras and made them reject the Vedas and the
<>laws thereof. All the Daityas (Asuras) became Bud-
<>dhists. There is a story in Agnipura1n2a, Chapter 16,
<>that thus it was the purpose of Buddha to convert
<>every asura to Buddhism and send him to hell.
<NI>The story given above is in accordance with the Pura1-
<>n2as. The following are the facts gained by historic
<>investigations.
<NI>Gautama Buddha was born in B.C. 560, in Kapilavastu
<>near the Hima1layas. His father was S4uddhodana. He
<>was born in the family of the S4a1kyas. The word ‘S4a1kya’
<>is another form of the word Ks2atriya. The real name of
<>Buddha was Siddha1rtha. S4uddhodana brought up his
<>son in such a way that he should not be subjected to
<>any sort of mental pain or worry. So he kept Buddha
<>aloof from the outer world. Thus he spent his childhood
<>in comfort and pleasure. Once by chance he happened
<>to see a sick man, an old man and a dead body. The
<>sight made him thoughtful. He began to think upon
<>a way to remove sorrow and pain from the world and
<>to bring about peace and comfort.
<NI>The change that appeared in the son worried the
<>father. So at the age of sixteen he made Siddha1rtha
<>marry Yas4odhara1. A son was born to them. But the
<>mind of Siddha1rtha was restless, distressed and agi-
<>tated. One day Siddha1rtha discarded everything and
<>went out of the palace alone.
<NI>Siddha1rtha wandered from place to place learning
<>from various teachers. But he did not find peace.
<>Once on a full-moon day while he was sitting in medi-
<>tation under a banian tree he got ‘Bodha’. (insight or
<>conviction). From that day onwards he began to be
<>known by the name ‘Buddha’. After that he came to
<>Ka1s4i, and told his disciples how he got Bodha or con-
<>viction. The number of his followers increased day by
<>day. Thus Buddhism came into being. Buddha said
<>that the reason for pain and sorrow in the world was
<>desire and that sorrow could be exterminated only
<>by controlling and overcoming all desire. To attain
<>Eternal Bliss one should be true and righteous in
<>thought, deed and word and that ‘Not Killing’ was
<>the foundation of righteousness. Buddhism spread
<>everywhere in Bha1rata.
<NI>Gautama Buddha died at the age of eighty.
<HI>BUDDHAGHOS2A. An ancient Sanskrit poet. It is be-
<>lieved that he lived in the 4th century A.D. The
<>most important work of this poet who was a Buddhist,
<>is ‘Padyacu1d2a1man2i’. The life of Buddha is described
<>in this Book in ten Ka1n2d2as (sections). A similarity to
<>the poems of Ka1lida1sa and As4vaghos2a is seen in this
<>poem. Buddhaghos2a is said to have reached Ceylon
<>in 357 A.D. and translated some Buddhist literature.
<HI>BUDDHI. A wife of Dharmadeva. In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a
<>Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7, it is mentioned that Dharmadeva
<>had married thirteen daughters of Daks2a. They are
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,
<>Buddhi, Lajja1, Vapus, S4a1nti, Siddhi1 and Ki1rti.
<HI>BUDDHIKA1MA. An attendant of S4ubrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>Salya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 12).
<HI>BUDDHISM. (BUDDHA-MATA). The origin of Bud-
<>dhism was in the sixth century B.C. This new religion
<>was shaped out of Hinduism that prevailed at that
<>time. Buddhism which had its origin in North India,
<>prevailed everywhere in India up to the eleventh [Page166-a+ 65]
<>century A.D. During that period there was an over-
<>flow of this religion to the other parts of Asia. Now
<>this religion has its full sway over the people of Burma.
<>90% of the population there, are adherents of Bud-
<>dhism. 80% of the people of Thailand, 60% of the
<>people in Ceylon and Japan and 17% in China are
<>now Buddhists. In India, Pakistan and the Philippines
<>the Buddhists are only a minority. Even though Indo-
<>nesia is a Muslim country there is a small class of
<>Buddhists there. Combodia, Lavos and Tibet are consi-
<>dered to be Buddhist countries. In Nepal there are
<>only two religions, Hinduism and Buddhism. In count-
<>ries outside Asia there are followers of Buddhism.
<>Statistics reveal that there are one hundred and sixty-
<>five thousand Buddhists in North America, one
<>hundred and thirtyfive thousand in South America,
<>and ten thousand in Europe. The number of Buddhists
<>in the world today is 150.31 crores.
<H>C
<HI>C. ({#ca#}) The letter C has two meanings, viz., evil people
<>and pure man.
<HI>CAIDYA. S4is4upa1la, king of Cedi. Dhr2s2t2aketu, King of
<>Cedi, is also known by this name. It was this Caidya
<>who led the Kraun5cavyu1ha created by Dhr2s2t2adyumna
<>in the great battle. (Kraun5cavyu1ha = A battle array
<>in the shape of a stork). (S4loka 47, Chapter 50, Bhi1s2ma

<HI>CAITRARATHA. A prince born to King Kuru of his
<>queen Va1hini1 (S4loka 50, Chapter 94, A1di Parva).
<HI>CAITRARATHA(M). A forest of pura1n2ic fame. Once
<>King Yaya1ti enjoyed sexual acts with the apsaras
<>Vis4va1ci1 in this forest. (S4loka 43, Chapter 75, A1di
<>Parva). It was here in this forest that Pa1n2d2u spent some
<>days once with his wives Ma1dri1 and Kunti1. (S4loka 48,
<>Chapter 118, A1di Parva).
<NI>As a support to the great mountain Maha1meru were
<>four mountains, Mandara, Merumandara, Supa1rs4va
<>and Kumuda. Above each of these was a garden-wood,
<>Nandana, Caitraratha, Vaibhra1jaka and Sarvatobhadra.
<>Thus it is to be presumed that Caitraratha was on
<>Merumandara. (Chapter 16, Pan5cama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>CAITRARATHA PARVA. A sub-division of A1di Parva,
<>(See under Maha1bha1rata).
<HI>CAITYAKA. A mountain. This mountain is situated
<>near Girivraja, the capital city of Magadha. This moun-
<>tain was very dear to the people of Magadha. The
<>followers of Br2hadratha deemed it as a God and
<>worshipped it. (Chapter 21, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CAKAT2A. (See Brahmadatta II).
<HI>CAKRA I. A son of Va1suki, the Na1ga king. He died at
<>the serpent yajn5a (Sarpa Satra) of Janamejaya by
<>falling into the fire. (A1di Parva, Chapter 57, Verse 6).
<HI>CAKRA II. One of the three attendants given to
<>Subrahman2ya by Vis2n2u, the other two being San3krama
<>and Atikrama. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 40).
<HI>CAKRA III. One of the two attendants presented to
<>Skandhadeva by Tvas2t2a, the other one being Anucakra.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 40).
<HI>CAKRA(M3) I. Sudars4ana Cakra (disc) of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Vis2n2u Pura1n2a contains the following story about
<>the origin of the Cakra.
<NI>Su1ryadeva (the Sun God) married Sam3jn5a1, daughter
<>of Vis4vakarma1. But, due to the insufferable heat of
<>her husband the marital life of Sam3jn5a1 became miser- [Page166-b+ 65]
<>able, and so she requested her father to lessen the heat
<>of Su1rya. And, accordingly Vis4vakarma1 ground Su1rya
<>on a grinding machine and thus diminished his efful-
<>gence. But, the grinding could diminish only (1/8) of
<>that effulgence, which glowing red-hot dropped on the
<>earth, and with that Vis4vakarma1 made the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra, the Tris4u1la, the Pus2pakavima1na and the
<>weapon called S4akti. Out of those four things the
<>Tris4u1la came to be possessed by S4iva, the Pus2paka-
<>vima1na by Kubera and S4akti by Brahma1. The Sudar-
<>s4ana Cakra which was glowing like anything was
<>deposited in the sea. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 3, Chapter 2).
<>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata as to how the
<>Cakra thrown into the sea came into the possession of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna were picnic-
<>ing on the shores of the Yamuna1 Agnideva went to
<>them and requested them to give Kha1n2d2ava forest to
<>him for food. As Taks2aka, friend of Indra, was living
<>in the forest the latter was causing heavy rains to fall
<>there. Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna realized the fact that Agni
<>would be able to consume the forest only after subjuga-
<>ting Indra. But, how to manage it? Then Agni said
<>that he would supply the weapon to fight Indra with,
<>and accordingly he meditated on Varun2a, who pre-
<>sented to him (Agni) a chariot and flag with monkey
<>as symbol, a quiver which would never become empty
<>of arrows, a bow called Ga1n2d2i1va and the Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. Agnideva gave the Cakra to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the
<>other things to Arjuna. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>297).
<HI>CAKRA(M3) II. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 45).
<HI>CAKRADEVA. A warrior born in Vr2s2n2i vam3s4a. (Vr2s2n2i
<>dynasty). (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 14, Verse 57).
<HI>CAKRADHANUS. A synonym of Kapila mahars2i. (See
<>Kapila).
<HI>CAKRADHARA. A very intelligent brahmin. One-eyed
<>and bent down in body he is a character in Vatsara1ja-
<>carita. (See Vidu1s2aka).
<HI>CAKRADHARMA1. Chief of the Vidya1dharas. He, with
<>his younger brother is engaged in singing the praise of
<>Kubera. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 10, Verse 27).
<HI>CAKRADVA1RA(M3). A great mountain. Indra per-
<>formed a yajn5a on this mountain. (S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 4, Verse 185).
<HI>CAKRAKA. The son, a Brahmava1din, of Vis4va1mitra.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 64).
<HI>CAKRAMANDA. A na1ga (a serpent). It was this
<>na1ga which was deputed by Ananta (na1ga king) to
<>lead the soul of Balara1ma on his death to Pa1ta1la.
<>(Mausala Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 16).
<HI>CAKRANEMI1. A woman attendant of Skandadeva.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 5).
<HI>CAKRA1TI. A town in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 9, Verse 45).
<HI>CAKRAVA1N. A mountain very much extolled in the
<>Pura1n2as. When deputing monkeys in quest of Si1ta1,
<>Sugri1va instructed them to make a special search in
<>Mount Cakrava1n. It was on this mountain that Vis4va-
<>karma1 made the Sudars4ana Cakra. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 42, Verse 16).
<HI>CAKRAVYU1HA. A Phalanx.
<NI>A particular pattern of army formation on ground. In
<>the Kaurava-Pa1n2d2ava war Dron2a1ca1rya formed a Cakra-
<>vyu1ha wherein Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna got himself [Page167-a+ 64]
<>trapped and killed. (Abhimanyu, who forced himself
<>inside the Vyu1ha did not know the method of get-
<>ing out of it which Arjuna alone knew). Cakravyu1ha is
<>made in the form and shape of Cart-wheels. Vya1sa has
<>described the Cakravyu1ha made by Dron2a as follows:--
<>The great preceptor made the Cakravyu1ha and posted
<>in it to maximum capacity kings, who were equal to
<>Indra. In every opening of the vyu1ha were posted
<>princes equal in prowess to the Sun. All the princes
<>were organised compactly. And, all of them wore red
<>uniforms and were adorned with other things also red
<>in colour and held red flags. They also wore golden
<>ornaments and garlands scented with Sandal paste.
<>Ten thousand strong they rushed forward to fight with
<>Abhimanyu. Duryodhana's son, Laks2man2a, led the
<>onrush. In the centre (of the Cakravyu1ha) stood
<>Duryodhana in the company of heroes like Karn2a,
<>Dus4s4a1sana and Kr2pa. And, at the head of the army
<>stood Dron2a, the captain of the army, who looked like
<>the rising sun. Then there was the King of Sindhu,
<>and near him stood As4vattha1ma1, and there stood in
<>front of them thirty Kauravas, all of them equal to
<>Devas. On the flanks were great heroes like S4alya,
<>Bhu1ris4ravas. And then did the battle rage. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 34).
<HI>CAKRIKA. A forest hunter. The following story is
<>told about him in Chapter 16, Kriya1yoga of the Padma
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Devoted much to his parents, Cakrika was a great
<>devotee of Vis2n2u. He used to worship Vis2n2u daily with
<>fruits, (edible) roots etc. But, he did so only after
<>himself tasting them. One day while thus tasting a
<>fruit, somehow or other it got itself lodged in his
<>throat, and all his attempts to dislodge it failed. The
<>fruit had to be, at any rate, offered to Vis2n2u and there-
<>fore Cakrika drew his sword and cut his throat with it.
<>Lord Vis2n2u who was so pleased at such great devotion
<>of the man appeared on the scene and brought him
<>back to life. Sometime afterwards Cakrika expired at
<>the Dva1raka1 temple, and thus attained salvation.
<HI>CAKRODDHATA. A king in the dynasty of Yaya1ti.
<>(Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US I. A synonym of the Sun. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>1, Verse 42).
<HI>CAKS2US II. A tributary of river Gan3ga1. Starting from
<>Vis2n2upa1da (Svarga) the Gan3ga1 falls into Devaya1na
<>and thence into the moon and after flooding the whole
<>area it divides itself into four tributaries, viz., Si1ta1,
<>Caks2us, Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and falls into Brahma-
<>loka and flows in four directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries the river called Caks2us falls on the peak of Mount
<>Ma1lyava1n and then flows through Ketuma1la and falls
<>into the western sea. The Gan3ga1 which flows through
<>India is a branch of the above-mentioned tributary,
<>Alakananda1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2US III. A king born in the lunar dynasty. He
<>was the son of King Anudruhyu. (Bha1gavata, Navama
<>Skandha).
<HI>CAKS2URVARDHANIKA1. A river which flows through
<>S4a1kadvi1pa. (S4a1ka island). (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 11,
<>Verse 33).
<HI>CA1KS2US2AMANU.
<NI>1) {%General.%} The sixth of the fourteen Manus. (See
<>Manvantara). [Page167-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Genealogy.%} Utta1napa1da and Priyavrata were the
<>sons of Sva1yambhuvamanu, and Dhruva was Utta1na-
<>pa1da's son. Dhruva had two sons, S4is2t2i, and Bhavya
<>by his wife S4ambhu. Sucha1ya1, wife of S4is2t2i, had five
<>sons, viz., Ripu, Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2kate-
<>jas. From Br2hati1, wife of Ripu, was born Ca1ks2us2a, the
<>mighty and Ca1ks2us2a begot a son called Manu by
<>Pus2karan2i1, daughter of Vi1ran2apraja1pati and one of the
<>offsprings of Varun2a. This Manu was called Ca1ks2us2a
<>Manu. And Ca1ks2us2a Manu had ten sons by his wife
<>Nadvala1, daughter of Vaira1japraja1pati, called Kuru,
<>Puru, S4atadyumna, Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agni-
<>s2t2oma, Atira1tra, Sudyumna and Abhimanyu. Out of
<>the ten, Puru had the following sons by A1gneyi1, viz.
<>An3ga, Sumanas, Khya1ti, Kratu, An3giras and S4ibi.
<>An3ga married Suni1tha1, and Vena was their son. The
<>famous emperor, Pr2thu was Vena's son.
<NI>3) {%Former life.%} The following story is told in the
<>Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a about the former life of Ca1ks2us2a
<>before he was born as Ca1ks2us2a. In that former life he
<>was A1nanda, son of Anamitra. Once a cat carried
<>A1nanda away and laid him on the bed of the child of
<>King Vikra1nta, and the same cat deposited the king's
<>child somewhere else. And, A1nanda grew up as the
<>real son of the King. But, one day he told the King
<>the truth about him and left for the forest for tapas.
<>Brahma1 appeared before him and blessed that he
<>would, in the next birth, be born as the sixth Manu
<>and thus Ca1ks2us2a became the sixth Manu.
<NI>4) {%Chief incidents during his time.%} During Ca1ks2us2aman-
<>vantara were born the famous Nara and Na1ra1yan2a as
<>the sons of Dharma. It was also during this period that
<>Brahma1 was born as Candra, Vis2n2u as Datta1treya and
<>S4iva as Durva1sas from Anasu1ya1, the purest of women
<>and the wife of Atri. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Caturtha
<>Skandha).
<HI>CA1KS2US2I1. An art, the study of which will enable one
<>to see anything in the three worlds. Ca1ks2us2i1 was
<>taught by Manu to Soma, by him to Vis4va1vasu, by
<>him to Citraratha, the Gandharva and by him to
<>Arjuna, son of Pa1n2d2u. (A1di Parva).
<HI>CA1KYA1RKU1TTU. A very important art practised in
<>temples mainly in Kerala. It is called so because it is
<>exhibited by Ca1kya1rs (a sect attached to temples). In
<>important temples a place called Ku1ttambala is set
<>apart for displaying the art. The Ku1ttu now prevalent
<>in Kerala temples is not exactly of its old form. Kula-
<>s4ekharavarma1 peruma1l (elected ruler of old Kerala)
<>effected some changes in the old art form, and Bha1skara-
<>ravivarma1 peruma1l and Tolakavi made further reforms
<>in it. The art of Ku1ttu was evolved with the object of
<>relating pura1n2ic stories in such a manner as will help
<>devotional feelings grow in man.
<NI>The main aim of the Ku1ttu is to narrate pura1n2ic
<>stories in such a way as to instil Bhakti in the hearers
<>and to create an interest in them in the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ca1kya1r (the man who gives the discourse who usually
<>belongs to the Brahmin sect called Ca1kya1rs) tells the
<>story in a very interesting way, reciting appropriate
<>passages from the Pura1n2as and illustrating them with
<>apt examples and similes. The narration is from the
<>beginning till end humorous. The Ca1kya1r who delivers
<>the discourse is usually a man with a good sense of
<>humour and a sense of what is odd, strange or eccentric
<>in nature and human character. There are three varie- [Page168-a+ 65]
<>ties of Ku1ttu: Prabandham3 Ku1ttu, Nam3biar Ku1ttu and
<>Ku1t2ia1t2t2am. Of these the first is narrative (A1khya1na-
<>para) while in the second and third type, the element
<>of acting is more important (Abhinayapara).
<HI>CALA1. Laks2mi1devi1. The following story is told in the
<>Devi1-bha1gavata as to how this name came to be
<>applied to the devi1. Once Revanta the very handsome
<>son of Su1ryadeva came to Vaikun2t2ha riding Uccaih2-
<>s4ravas, Indra's horse. Devi1, who was at that time with
<>Vis2n2u gazed for a few minutes in wonder at the horse.
<>She did not, therefore, attend to Vis2n2u's talk. Angered
<>at this Vis2n2u told the devi1: “Since your eyes find
<>enjoyment on unnecessary things and move about
<>among such objects, you shall be called from today
<>onwards Rama1 and Cala1. Also you will be born as a
<>mare on earth. Accordingly Maha1laks2mi1 was born as
<>a mare on the banks of river Sarasvati1, and regained
<>her old form only after delivering a son by Vis2n2u. That
<>son was Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya kingdom. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 6).
<HI>CAMARA. (CAMARI1). An animal whose tail is its most
<>important and valued organ. In the course of its move-
<>ments in the forest if the tail gets entangled anywhere
<>it is supposed to lie down there till the tail is freed by
<>itself. About the origin of Camara, the following story
<>is told in the Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a. Krodhavas4a1, daughter
<>of Daks2apraja1pati and wife of Kas4yapa had ten daugh-
<>ters, viz. Mr2gi1, Mr2gamada1, Hari, Bhadramada1,
<>Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, S4veti1, Surasa1, Surabhi and Kadru1.
<>To Mr2gamada1 the Sr2maras and Camaras owe their
<>origin. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>CA1MARA(M). A rod (handle) with a large tuft of
<>hair, fibre or feathers at the end. A symbol used by
<>kings and brahmins. Ca1mara of the king should have a
<>golden handle, and it should be made of the wings of
<>the swan, the pea cock, the Bala1ka1 bird etc. But, the
<>wings of different birds shall not be intermixed. Circu-
<>lar in shape, the Ca1mara should have on its handle
<>3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 sandhis (joints, knots). (Agni-
<>pura1n2a, Chapter 245).
<HI>CAMASA. A yogi, the younger brother of Bharata, a king
<>born in the dynasty of Priyavrata, son of Manu. This
<>country got its name Bha1rata from king Bharata (country
<>ruled by Bharata). Bharata had nine brothers called
<>Kus4a1varta, Ila1varta, Brahma1varta, A1rya1varta, Malaya,
<>Bhadraketu, Sena, Indraspr2k and Ki1kat2a. Bharata had
<>also nine other brothers renowned as navayogi1s, born
<>of another mother. Camasa was one of them, the other
<>eight being Kavi, Hari, Ambari1s2a, Prabuddha, Pippa-
<>la1yana, A1vi1rhotra, Dramid2a and Kharabha1jana. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAMASODBHEDA. A holy place in Saura1s2t2ra which
<>forms part of the very reputed sacred place called
<>Vina1s4ana. It is said that it was here that the river
<>Sarasvati1 which once became invisible, was detected. A
<>bath here is as efficacious as performing the Jyotis2t2oma
<>yajn5a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 112).
<HI>CAMATKA1RA. (See PATTU).
<HI>CAMOHARA. A vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva.
<>Chapter 191, Verse 35).
<HI>CAMPA. A king born in the An3ga dynasty. (See
<>CANDRAVAM3S4A).
<HI>CAM3PA1. (CAM3PA1PURI1). A city on the banks of river
<>Gan3ga1, Cam3pa1 is often referred to in the Pura1n2as4. It
<>was here that Lomapa1da lived in treta1yuga. (M.B. [Page168-b+ 64]
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 113, Verse 15). In Dva1parayuga
<>the city was ruled by a Su1ta called Atiratha, who got
<>Karn2a, while he and his wife were brooding over their
<>lack of a child. In after years Karn2a also ruled the
<>city. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 5, Verse 7).
<HI>CAM3PAKA. A vidya1dhara. Once he visited the banks
<>of river Yamuna1 with his wife Mada1lasa1 when they got
<>from the forest nearby a child. The child in later years
<>became famous as Ekavi1ra, founder of the Hehaya
<>dynasty. (See EKAVI1RA).
<HI>CAMPAKA1RAN2YA. (CAMPA1KARA). A holy place
<>in Northern India. One day's halt at the place and a
<>bath there is considered to be as good as giving away
<>one thousand cows as gift. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 84).
<HI>CA1MPEYA. Son of Vis4va1mitra who was a brahmava1din
<>(M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 58).
<HI>CAMPU1. A literary form of presenting a story in a
<>mixture of prose and verse, and abounding in beauti-
<>ful descriptions: “Gadyapadyamayam3 ka1vyam3 Cam-
<>pu1rityabhidhi1yate”. Over and above prose and verse
<>the Campu1s use dan2d2akas (very long, involved and
<>poetical prose). This literary form had its origin
<>first in Sanskrit and other Indian languages adopted it
<>with some variations. For instance, though prose in
<>Sanskrit Campu1s is really prose, that in Malayalam
<>is something akin to metrical prose. There are more
<>than two hundred Campu1s in Malayalam. The most
<>famous of the Campu1 writers in Malaya1lam are
<>Punam Namboothiri, Maha1man3galam Namboothiri
<>and Ni1lakan2t2ha.
<HI>CAMU1. A division of an army. (See Aksauhin2i1)
<HI>CA1MUN2D2A1. (See Pa1rvati1).
<HI>CA1N2AKA. The auspiciousness of Ca1n2aka (cowdung) is
<>due to Laks2mi1. (See Laks2mi1, Paras 1 and 6).
<HI>CA1N2AKYA (KAUT2ILYA). The famous author of
<>“Arthas4a1stra” a treatise on political economy.
<NI>Eastern and western scholars have made exhaustive
<>researches on this intellectual giant of ancient India,
<>Ca1n2akya. But, nothing definite has yet been established
<>about his time or life. Indians have accepted as a fact
<>the traditional legend that he was a minister of Candra-
<>gupta, the founder of the Maurya dynasty. It is also
<>firmly believed that it was this mighty intellect of a
<>brahmin who made Candragupta a powerful emperor
<>and steered the ship of his state. The phrase ‘Ca1n2akya's
<>kut2ilani1ti’ (crooked tactics) has become proverbial.
<>Some scholars hold the opinion that he came to be
<>called ‘Kaut2ilya’ because of his Kut2ila (crooked)
<>tactics; but evidence to establish this view-point is yet
<>to be adduced.
<NI>It is his famous Arthas4a1stra, which has made Ca1n2akya's
<>name a world famous one. The great German thinker
<>Jolly has described the Arthas4a1stra as a unique composi-
<>tion in the Sanskrit language. And, Johann Meyer, the
<>great western scholar has the following to say about
<>the book:--
<NI>“Kaut2ilya's Arthas4a1stra is not one single text, it is a
<>collection and collateration of all books in ancient
<>India. To study the greatness of the theories and
<>principles contained in it today requires continuous and
<>constant study at least for twenty years and the un-
<>remitting efforts of a scholar with unabounded know-
<>ledge are required.” [Page169-a+ 65]
<>Even his name has not yet been confirmed beyond
<>doubts. Kaut2ilya is also called Vis2n2ugupta, Ca1n2akya,
<>Dramila, and An3gula. Modern researches place the
<>date of the Arthas4a1stra at near about B.C. 400. In
<>Vis4a1khadatta's Mudra1ra1ksasa (drama) the name
<>Kaut2ilya is used.
<NI>The Authors of Ni1tis4a1stra maintain that the name of
<>the author of Arthas4a1stra was Vis2n2ugupta. It may be
<>gathered from the Mudra1ra1ks2asa that he became famous
<>as Ca1n2akya as he was the son of Can2aka, and that
<>he possessed deep erudition in Ni1tis4a1stra, Dharma-
<>s4a1stra and astrology. There is another legend to the
<>effect that this brahmin (Ca1n2akya) belonged to Ka1n5ci1-
<>pura and that he migrated to Pa1t2ali1putra, the seat of
<>learning and scholarship. As Ka1mandaka, who lived
<>in the fourth century B.C. has eulogised Ca1n2akya in
<>his ni1tis4a1stra it may be surmised that Ca1n2akya lived
<>sometime near about that. Candragupta and Ca1n2akya
<>are referred to in the Vis2n2u and the Va1mana Pura1n2as.
<>Kaut2ilya was keen-eyed and scholar par excellence.
<>“Arthas4a1stra” is a great book written by him after
<>thoroughly examining the viewpoints of previous
<>scholars, and then establishing his own views and
<>theories. From the Das4akuma1racarita of Dan2d2i1 (A.D.
<>700) it may be seen that there are 6000 verses in the
<>Anus2t2up metre (eight letters in one line) in the Artha-
<>s4a1stra composed by Vis2n2ugupta for the use of Candra-
<>gupta Maurya. The Artha a1stra has been held in praise
<>by Ba1n2abhat2t2a who lived in the 7th Century, Soma-
<>devasu1ri, who lived in the 10th century and also by
<>Hemacandra, the author of Ka1vya1nus4a1sana, who lived
<>in the 12th century. The book is a discourse on the
<>principles and practices that are necessary to establish
<>a strong government of an ideal empire. Ca1n2akya has
<>mentioned in his book with respect the old scholars like
<>Manu, S4ukra, Br2haspati, Na1ra1yan2a, Ka1tya1yana and
<>Govinda di1ks2ita. (For the pura1n2ic story about Ca1n2akya
<>see Vararuci, Para 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1. A notorious harlot who lived in dva1-
<>para yuga. When one day at midnight she came to the
<>appointed place to meet a paramour the latter had not
<>arrived. While waiting impatiently there she was
<>attacked and killed by a leopard. Emissaries of Vis2n2u
<>as also of Yama arrived to carry away the soul of
<>Can5cala1ks2i1. Yama's men argued that she had sinned
<>throughout her life, and therefore claimed the harlot's
<>soul. But the emissaries of Visn2u countered the argu-
<>ment thus: “once on her way to conduct her trade
<>Can5cala1ks2i1 got into a temple and munched ta1mbu1la in
<>the course of which she rubbed some lime on the walls
<>of the temple. Taking into consideration this fact of
<>her having spent sometime thus to clean the temple
<>wall her soul deserves to be led to Vis2n2uloka”.
<NI>In the argument the emissaries of Yama were defeated
<>and the soul of Can5cala1ks2i1 was taken to Vaikun2t2ha by
<>the emissaries of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<HI>CAN5CALA1KS2I1 II. A vidya1dhara girl. Once while she
<>was concentrating her mind in prayer over Maha1laksmi1,
<>Ra1van2a, King of the Ra1ks2asas, committed rape on her,
<>and she cursed him that he should die on account of
<>Maha1laks2mi1 herself and accordingly at last he was
<>killed by Ra1ma on account of Si1ta1, the incarnation of
<>Maha1laks2mi1. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CAN2D2A. (See Can2d2amun2d2a1s).
<HI>CAN2D2ABALA. A prominent monkey. In the Ra1ma- [Page169-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a war this monkey caused much trouble to Kum-
<>bhakarn2a. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 287, Verse 6).
<HI>CAN2D2ABHA1RGAVA. A mahars2i born in the dynasty
<>of Cyavana Muni. A very erudite scholar and deeply
<>versed in the Vedas, it was this mahars2i, who performed
<>Janamejaya's famous Sarpa sattra. (M.B., A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 58, Verse 4).
<HI>CAN2D2AKA. A forest hunter who attained salvation by
<>the worship of S4ivalin3ga. (Phallus of S4iva).
<NI>While once hunting in the woods Can2d2aka saw a S4iva
<>temple in ruins, and the S4ivalin3ga lying on the ground
<>uncared for. This sight greatly grieved him, and he
<>told S4im3haketu, son of the Pa1n5ca1la Ra1ja who happened
<>to come that way all about the temple and the
<>lin3ga. To his query as to whether the s4a1stra permitted
<>a hunter like himself to worship S4ivalin3ga, Sim3haketu
<>answered there were injunctions in the S4a1stras for
<>people like him (Can2d2akas) to instal S4ivalin3ga on
<>rock and then worship it daily, the worshipper wear-
<>ing ashes from the burning gha1t2 on his body. Accord-
<>ingly Can2d2aka installed the lin3ga on a rock and began
<>worshipping it daily along with his wife, Pulindi1. But
<>after sometime there was left no ashes in the burning
<>gha1t2 and Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 discussed between them
<>the means to get ashes for the next day. Then Pulindi1
<>suggested that she should burn herself to ashes and that
<>Can2d2aka should continue worshipping the S4ivalin3ga
<>wearing on his body the ashes. Very unwillingly
<>Can2d2aka agreed with the sad proposal of his wife, and
<>the next day he worshipped the S4ivalin3ga wearing on
<>his body the ashes of Pulindi1. And, at the close of the
<>worship he called aloud for Pulindi1, and lo! wonder
<>of wonders! she stood there before him more healthy
<>than formerly. Moreover a vima1na descended from the
<>skies and conducted both Can2d2aka and Pulindi1 to
<>S4ivaloka. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4am3barama1ha1tyma).
<HI>CAN2D2AKAUS4IKA. A muni, son of Kaks4iva1n, the son of
<>Gautama. Br2hadratha, King of Magadha, was having no
<>issues when, one day, Can2d2akaus4ika went to the palace
<>and blessed the King as a result of which a son called
<>Jara1sandha was born to him. Can2d2akaus4ika continued to
<>live at Magadha for long as the preceptor of the kings of
<>that land. (See Jara1sandha).
<HI>CAN2D2A1LA. (See Ca1turvarn2ya).
<HI>CAN2D2AMAHA1SENA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A very prominent and reputed king of
<>Ujjayini. Va1savadatta1, wife of Udayana was his
<>daughter.
<NI>2) {%The name Can2d2amaha1sena.%} His real name was Maha1-
<>sena. After ascending the throne he began doing
<>tapas to get a noble wife and a good sword. When he
<>cut his own flesh and made an offering of the same to
<>the sacred fire after a long period of tapas the Devi1
<>became pleased, and offered him a sword of exceptional
<>excellence and said that as long as he had that sword
<>with him no enemy would defeat him. The Devi1 also
<>assured him that ere long An3ga1ravati1, daughter of the
<>asura called An3ga1raka and the fairest damsel in the
<>three worlds would become his wife. Since he (Maha1-
<>sena) did the most austere rites and rituals, the Devi1
<>said, he would come to be called Can2d2amaha1sena.
<>Afterwards the sword given by the Devi1 and the ele-
<>phant called nad2a1giri proved as successful and effective
<>to him as were Vajra1yudha and his elephant Aira1vata
<>to Indra. [Page170-a+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} One day, during a hunting expedition
<>a boar escaped unhurt by the king's arrows and after
<>turning turtle his chariot it went into a cave. The king
<>in great anger followed the pig into the cave, and going
<>forward some distance he saw a beautiful animal where-
<>upon he seated himself on the side of a tank. There he
<>saw, amidst a number of women an exceptionally
<>beautiful woman moving about. Casting her charming
<>eyes glistering with love the woman approached the
<>King. During their conversation, when the king told
<>her about himself she began crying. To the query as
<>to the reason for her crying she answered as follows:--
<>“The boar you saw is my father, An3ga1raka1sura. His
<>body is harder than even diamond, and none can inflict
<>any injury on it. The women you see around are
<>princesses captured by my father from various palaces
<>for my help, and my name is An3ga1ravati1. My father
<>became a Ra1ks2asa as the result of a curse; he is now
<>asleep in the assumed form of a boar. On awaking he
<>is sure to eat you for food, and it was that thought which
<>brought tears to my eyes”. To these words of An3ga1ra-
<>vati1, the king replied as follows:--“If you have any
<>love for me you would go to your father and begin
<>crying when he wakes up, and to his question as to
<>why you are crying you should reply that thoughts
<>about your future in the event of your fathers's death
<>brought tears in your eyes.”
<NI>An3ga1ravati1 agreed to the above proposal of the King.
<>She hid the King in a safe place and went and stood
<>by the side of her father. Everything happened as was
<>anticipated and An3ga1raka consoled his daughter by
<>saying that none would be able to kill him whose
<>body was as hard and strong as diamond, there being
<>only one opening through which he might be struck on
<>the left wrist which might be concealed by the bow.
<>Can2d2amaha1sena who heard the above talk came out of
<>his hiding place and challenged the asura to war. He
<>raised his left hand to show the sign, “just coming,
<>please wait”, and the king then shot his arrow through
<>the opening on his left wrist. The asura fell dead.
<NI>4) {%Birth of Va1savadatta1:%} And, now Can2d2amaha1sena
<>married An3ga1ravati1 and returned to his kingdom with
<>his wife. Two sons, Gopa1laka and Pa1laka were born to
<>the royal couple, and the King celebrated an Indro-
<>tsava for the welfare and prosperity of the children.
<>Pleased at the utsava Indra appeared to the king in
<>sleep and blessed him saying that a daughter would be
<>born to him and that her son would be crowned empe-
<>ror of the Vidya1dharas. Accordingly a daughter was
<>born to the King, and she was called Va1savadatta1.
<>(given by Va1sava, i.e. Indra). Udayana married Va1sava-
<>datta1. (See Udayana).
<HI>CAN2D2AMUN2D2AS. Two brothers born in the Asura
<>dynasty, the elder brother being called Can2d2a and
<>the younger Mun2d2a. These brothers collected, like
<>the other asura leaders Dhu1mra1ks2a, and Raktabi1ja,
<>thousands of soldiers and lived in all pomp and
<>glory.
<NI>During this period two asura brothers called S4umbha
<>and Nis4umbha had returned from the Hima1layas after
<>securing from Brahman a boon that they would meet
<>with their death only at the hands of a woman. Can2d2a
<>and Mun2d2a became their friends and attendants.
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha set out on a triumphal tour
<>and conquered heaven, earth and pa1ta1la. The Devas [Page170-b+ 65]
<>took refuge in a forest. After wandering in the forest
<>for a long time, at the instance of Br2haspati they sought
<>asylum with Pa1rvati1. Pa1rvati1 stood for sometime in deep
<>concentration, and there emerged from her divine body
<>Kaus2iki1 or Ka1li1. Pa1rvati1 assured the Devas that she
<>would kill S4umbha and Nis4umbha. And, then Ka1li1 sat
<>alone on a rock in the thick Forest. Can2d2a and Mun2d2a,
<>who happened to pass that way were attracted by the
<>great beauty of Pa1rvati1 and imparted the news to
<>S4umbha and Nis4umbha, and they deputed Dhu1mra1ks2a
<>and 60,000 soldiers to bring Pa1rvati1 over to them; but
<>by one hum3ka1ra (sound ‘hum’) she reduced them to
<>ashes. Ultimately she killed S4umbha and Nis4umbha
<>also. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<HI>CAN2D2ATUN2D2AKA(S). A son of Garuda. (Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 9).
<HI>CAN2D2AVEGA. A gandharva. (See Puran5jana).
<HI>CAN2D2IKA1. A terrific form of Pa1rvati1, who is worship-
<>ped in temples under the name Can2d2ika1devi1. The
<>Devi1's idol has twenty hands. In the hands on the right
<>side are held S4u1la (three-pronged weapons) sword,
<>Vela (rod), Cakra, pa1s4a (rope), parigha (shield),
<>a1yudha, abhaya, d2amaru and S4akti, while the hands
<>on the left side hold na1gapa1s4a, small parigha, axe,
<>An3kus4a (a long-hooked rod), pa1s4a, man2i, flag, gada1,
<>mirror and an iron cylindrical rod. There are also
<>idols of Can2d2ika1 with ten hands. At the feet of the
<>Devi1 lies Mahis2a1sura with his head severed from body.
<>There will also be standing near the idol a purus2a (man)
<>born from the neck of the Ma1his2a brandishing his wea-
<>pon, and with the S4u1la in his hand in all rage and
<>womitting blood and with red hairs and eyes. That
<>purus2a is bound strongly on his neck with rope. The
<>vehicle of the Devi1 is a lion. The Devi1 is mounted on
<>the lion with her left leg on the asura lying below. This
<>Can2d2ika1devi1 thus stands with weapons in the hand, as
<>annihilator of enemies and with three eyes, and she
<>should be worshipped in pu1ja1man2d2ala with nine Padmas
<>(tantric divisions) along with her idol. Firstly the Devi1
<>should be worshipped in the central padma and Indra
<>and others in the other padmas.
<NI>There is also another Can2d2ika1devi1 (Durga1) with eigh-
<>teen hands. She holds in her right hand a skull, shield,
<>mirror, broom, bow, flag, d2amaru and pa1s4a (cord) and
<>in her left hand rod, iron pounder, S4u1la, Vajra, sword,
<>An3kus4a (a sticklike weapon with one end bent to hold
<>on to things) S4ara (arrow) Cakra and s4ala1ka1. There
<>are nine other Durga1s having the same weapons as the
<>above except the D2amaru and the broom. But, they
<>have only sixteen hands each. These nine Durga1s are
<>called Rudracan2d2a1, Pracan2d2a1, Ugracan2d2a1, Can2d2a1-
<>na1yika1, Atican2d2ika1, and Can2d2ogra1. The Durga1 standing
<>at the centre will have the colour of gorocana (red
<>sandal paste) and the others will have the following
<>colours; arun2avarn2a (red) Kr2s2n2a varn2a (black), ni1la
<>varn2a (blue), s4ukla varn2a (white), dhu1mra varn2a
<>(brown) pi1ta varn2a (yellow) and s4vet2a varn2a (white).
<>The nava Durga1s (nine Durga1s) are installed for the
<>prosperity of children etc. And all these are different
<>forms of Pa1rvati1.
<NI>Also, in various aspects or poses, Pa1rvati1 is called by
<>other names. She is called Siddha1 when installed in
<>Ram3bha1-vana wearing aks2ama1la1 (garland of beads),
<>kiri1t2a (crown) and agni. The same Siddha1 without
<>the fire is called Lalita1. Gauri1devi1 with one of the [Page171-a+ 65]
<>hands on the left side placed on the shoulder and the
<>head, and holding the mirror in the other hand, and
<>holding in one of the hands on the right side fruits etc.
<>and the other hand held up is called Saubha1gya gauri1.
<>(For further details see Pa1rvati1). (Agni Pura1n2a, Chap-
<>ter 50).
<HI>CANDRA I. A prominent asura, also called Candra-
<>varman. It was this asura, as beautiful as Candra (the
<>moon) who was born as the king of Ka1mboja under
<>the name Candravarman (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>67, Verse 31).
<HI>CANDRA II. A king born in the Solar dynasty and the
<>son of Vis4varandhi and father of Yuvana1s4va. See
<>Vam3s4a1vali1)
<HI>CANDRA III. The Pura1n2as declare that Candra was
<>one of the invaluable things got at the churning of
<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi (ocean of milk) Candra, Maha1laks2mi1, Sura1,
<>Uccaih2s4ravas, Kaustubha, Pa1rija1ta, Ka1madhenu,
<>Dhanvantari, Amr2tam and Ka1laku1t2a were the things
<>thus got from the Ocean of Milk. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 18 and Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 9). Also,
<>the evil devata1 called Jyes2t2ha1, Aira1vata, the gem
<>named Cinta1man2i and fair damsels like Ta1ra1 and Ruma1
<>were got from the Ks2i1ra1bdhi, (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddhaka1n2d2a). For general information about Candra,
<>see Grahas).
<HI>CANDRA IV. (CANDRA DEVA).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The child born to Atri by Anasuya1. (See
<>Puru1ravas). In Skandha 4 of the Devi1bha1gavata it is
<>stated that it was Brahman who was born as Candra.
<>(See Atri).
<NI>2) {%Candra led married life with the wife of his guru.%} Ta1ra1,
<>the very beautiful wife of Br2haspati, preceptor of the
<>Devas happened to reach Candra's home during her
<>perambulation one day. Candra and Ta1ra1 fell in love
<>with each other at first sight and lived in conjugal
<>happiness. And thus days passed by. Br2haspati, being
<>informed of the fact on enquiry, deputed his disciples
<>to bring Ta1ra1 back, but to no purpose. Br2haspati sent
<>his disciples again and again to Ta1ra1, but all to no
<>purpose. Then Br2haspati himself went to the house of
<>Candra and invited Ta1ra1, this time also to no purpose.
<>Enraged at this the Deva guru spoke to Candra as
<>follows: “The brahmin-killer, gold-thief, drunkard, he
<>who marries another's wife and he who associates him-
<>self with the above three types are responsible for the
<>most terrible five sins, and you, therefore, are not fit
<>enough to reside in Devaloka. Unless you return my
<>wife to me I will curse you.” None of the threats of
<>Br2haspati could shake Candra. He told the Devaguru
<>that Ta1ra1 who had gone to his house on her own accord
<>would also leave him when she was satiated with him.
<>These words of Candra made Br2haspati all the more
<>angry. He returned home and waited sometime more
<>for Ta1ra1's return. But, he got disappointed, and getting
<>impatient he started again for Candra's house. But,
<>this time the gatekeepers did not let him in.
<NI>Terribly angry at the cruel rebuff Br2haspati sought
<>help of Indra. Indra sent word to Candra asking him
<>to send Ta1ra1 back home or be prepared for war. Even
<>then Candra refused to yield, and Indra started for
<>war against Candra. But, there was somehow some dif-
<>ference among the devas about all this, and the news
<>reached the asuras. At once S4ukra, preceptor of the
<>asuras and an old enemy of Br2haspati met Candra and [Page171-b+ 65]
<>assured him all support in case war broke out between
<>Indra and Candra. He also strongly advised Candra
<>not to return Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati. And, ultimately a
<>fierce war began between Indra and Candra. All acti-
<>vities in the world were thrown into confusion and
<>chaos. At this Brahma1 on his ham3sa (swan) came to
<>the scene and admonished Candra and S4ukra. They
<>could not but obey Brahma1 and so were forced to stop
<>fighting. Moreover, Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2has-
<>pati.
<NI>The quarrel and fighting thus ended for the time
<>being, but another problem cropped up. At the time
<>Candra returned Ta1ra1 to Br2haspati she was carrying,
<>and Br2haspati was not aware of the fact. And at last
<>Ta1ra1 delivered an exceptionally beautiful male child.
<>The naming ceremony of the child was duly performed,
<>Br2haspati himself acting as its father. When the news
<>reached Candra he sent a messenger to Br2haspati
<>claiming the child was his. Br2haspati too claimed its
<>fatherhood. This controversy developed almost to the
<>brink of a second deva1sura war. At this stage Brahma1
<>went to Br2haspati's house and questioned Ta1ra1 as to
<>who really was her child's father, and she named Candra.
<>Upon this Brahma1 asked Br2haspati to release the child
<>to Candra. Br2haspati did so. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pratha-
<>ma Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Wives of Candra.%} Candra took twentyseven daugh-
<>ters of Daks2a as his wives. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha). These twentyseven wives are the twenty-
<>seven stars. Candra circumambulates Maha1meru along
<>with these, his twentyseven wives (Stars). (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 163, Verse 33). The names of the
<>twentyseven wives are given hereunder: As4vini1, Bha-
<>ran2i1, Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu,
<>Pus2ya, A1s4les2a1, Janakam3, Pha1lguni1, Uttarapha1lguni1,
<>Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti, Vis4a1kha1, Anura1dha1, Jyes2t2ha1,
<>Mu1la1, Purva1s2a1d2ha1, Uttara1s2a1d2ha1, S4ron2a1, S4ravis2t2ha,
<>Pracetas, Pu1rvapros2t2hapada1, Uttarapros2t2hapada1,
<>Revati1.
<NI>{%Solar eclipse according to the Pura1n2as.%} The Devas and
<>the asuras jointly churned Ks2i1ra1bdhi wherefrom emerg-
<>ed Dhanvantari with the Amr2takumbha (pot of nectar).
<>(See Amr2tam).
<NI>But an asura ma1ya1vi1 (magician) called Saim3hikeya
<>absconded to Pa1ta1la with the Amr2takumbha which
<>nobody noticed as everybody was busy with dividing
<>other divine objects. Only after the ma1ya1vi1's disap-
<>pearance was it noticed that the Amr2ta Kumbha was
<>missing. At once Maha1vis2n2u assumed the figure of a
<>beautiful woman, got back the Kumbha and gave it to
<>the devas. The devas began drinking the amr2tam when,
<>at the instance of some other devas, Saim3hikeya, the
<>ma1ya1vi1 assuming the form of an old brahmin reached
<>svarga, got a share of the amr2ta and began to drink it.
<>Su1rya and Candra (Sun and Moon) who were on
<>guard at the gates divined the secret of the ‘old
<>brahmin’ and informed Maha1vis2n2u about it. He cut
<>the throat of the pseudo-brahmin with his Sudars4ana
<>Cakra. But, half of the nectar he had drunk stayed
<>above the throat and the other half below it. Therefore,
<>though the head and the trunk were severed they
<>remained alive. These two parts, in course of time,
<>evolved as Ra1hu and Ketu.
<NI>When the throat was cut some blood as well as some
<>amr2ta dropped on two places on the ground, and they [Page172-a+ 64]
<>became the red onion and the white onion respecti-
<>vely. Some vaidika brahmins used to consider the red
<>onion objectionable for consumption as it was evolved
<>from blood, while the white onion was considered
<>usable as it was evolved from amr2tam.
<NI>R2a1hu and Ketu still maintain their hatred for Su1rya
<>and Candra who had betrayed the asura, who, disguis-
<>ed as brahmin tried to drink the amr2ta. Eclipse is the
<>phenomenon of Ra1hu and Ketu swallowing Su1rya and
<>Candra as and when opportunity presents itself for it.
<>But, since the throat is severed from the body, Su1rya
<>and Candra thus swallowed get out through the throat.
<>That is the reason why Su1rya and Candra become
<>visible after the eclipse in over. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a and Bha1gavata As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>5) {%Candra besame Calf.%} Once emperor Pr2thu trans-
<>formed Bha1midevi1 into a cow and milked from her all
<>things and provisions. On that occasion it was Brahma1,
<>who acted as Calf. And, following Pr2thu when the
<>R2s2is milked the cow Candra served as Calf. (For
<>details see Pr2thu).
<NI>6) {%Waxing and waning of Candra, the pura1n2ic story regard-
<>ding it.%} Of the twentyseven daughters of Daks2a whom
<>Candra had married he loved Rohin2i1 much more than
<>the other twentysix wives, and so kept her always with
<>him. This annoyed the twentysix wives, who complained
<>about it to Daks2a. Daks2a's advice to Candra to treat
<>all the wives on an equal footing had no effect on him.
<>So, the twentysix neglected wives again complained to
<>Daks2a as follows: “We shall stay in the a1s4rama and
<>serve you. Soma (Candra) does not associate with us,
<>he will not accept your advice.”
<NI>Though Daks2a warned Candra a second time, that too
<>had no effect on him. So the twentysix wives, for the
<>third time, complained to Daks2a. Daks2a got angry at
<>this and cursed that Candra should suffer from tuber-
<>culosis. Thus Candra was afflicted by consumption.
<>Though Candra performed many a yajn5a to get cured
<>of the fell disease, they did not produce the desired
<>effect. Candra remaining a tubercular patient, the
<>growth of medicinal plants stopped with the result that
<>all living things contracted consumption. When people
<>began becoming thinner, the devas asked Candra for
<>an explanation, and he told them all the details. They
<>then sought the help of Daks2a, who gave Candra
<>redemption from the curse by ordaining that if he dived
<>in the Sarasvati1 ti1rtha in the western sea he would be
<>free from consumption for half of every month. Thence-
<>forth Candra made it a practice to dive in the Saras-
<>vati1ti1rtha and that is the reason why Candra is exempt-
<>ed from Ks2ayaroga for fifteen days. (M.B. S4alya Parva,
<>Chapter 35).
<NI>7) {%Candra--King of stars and of medicines.%} During the
<>reign of emperor Pr2thu, he changed Bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow. Later the R2s2is also changed bhu1midevi1 into a
<>cow and milked her. It was Candra who served as
<>calf then. Pleased at this Brahman crowned Candra as
<>king of the stars and medicines. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter
<>4, Verse 2).
<NI>8) {%Other information about Candra%}
<NI>(1) Candra is 11,000 sq. yojanas in area, 33,000 yojanas
<>in circumference and a volume of 5,900 cubic yojanas.
<>(M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12).
<NI>(2) Candra presented two attendants called Man2i and [Page172-b+ 65]
<>Sumati to Subrahman2ya (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45,
<>Verse 32).
<NI>(3) Candra once made a discourse on the superior
<>qualities of brahmins to S4ambara1sura. (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 36, Verse 13, Southern Text).
<NI>(4) All welfare and prosperity accrue to him, who on
<>full-moon day at moon-rise tenders offerings to Candra
<>of bread in copper vessels with honey poured into it.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 36, Verse, 13, Southern
<>Text).
<NI>(5) Candra is one of the as2t2a-vasus. Candra had
<>four sons, Varcas, S4is4ira, Pra1n2a and Raman2a by his
<>wife named Manohara1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 66,
<>Verse 18).
<NI>(6) Abhimanyu was Candra's son, Varcas, reborn as
<>the son of Arjuna. (See Abhimanyu).
<HI>CANDRA1. An important river in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma

<HI>CANDRAGUPTA I. Second son of Ra1van2a. Once
<>when S4ri1 Ra1ma was King, Candragupta abducted the

<>Sahasramukha Ra1van2a).
<HI>CANDRAGUPTA II. A minister of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was once fed sumptuously by Jamad-
<>agni at his a1s4rama with the help of S4us4i1la1, the deva-
<>surabhi (divine cow). Candragupta, at the instance of
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna tried to capture Sus4i1la1 by force, which
<>disappeared immediately in the sky. Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna's
<>servants then forcibly took away its calf. Candragupta
<>thrashed to death Jamadagni, who tried to obstruct
<>their action. (See Ka1rtavi1rya, Para 9).
<HI>CANDRAHANTA1. An asura, who was reborn as King
<>S4unaka. (M.B., A1di Parva, Chapter 677, Verse 37).
<HI>CANDRAHARTA1. A son born to Kas2yapa praja1pati of
<>Sim3hika1, daughter of Daks2a. (M.B., A1di Parva,

<HI>CANDRAHA1SA. Son of King Sudha1rmika of Kerala.
<>The following story about him is told in Jaimini As4va-
<>medha Parva.
<NI>Candraha1sa, born under the star Mu1lam had a sixth
<>finger on the left foot indicative of poverty and of all
<>other evils. And, therefore, on his birth enemies killed
<>Sudha1rmika and his wife followed him soon to the
<>other world. The child thus left an orphan was taken
<>to Kaun2d2alakapuri1 by a female inmate of the palace.
<>But unfortunately the woman died within three years
<>of the above incident. The child, just for very existence,
<>took to begging. After sometime some women jointly
<>took up charge of the boy. Once he went to the house
<>of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, minister of Kaun2d2ala where a feast
<>was in progress. The munis present there were impres-
<>sed by Candraha1sa and prophesied that he would be-
<>come a King. To Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the munis said that the
<>child would guard his wealth. Angry and suspicious at
<>the prophesy of the munis Dhr2s2t2abuddhi asked his men
<>to kill the boy. They led him to the forest. On the
<>way Candraha1sa got a S4a1lagra1ma (a small sacred stone
<>which represented some upadevata1) which he applied
<>very devotedly to his face. They did not in fact kill the
<>boy, but cut off his sixth finger on the left foot and
<>showed it to their master.
<NI>Thus left alive in the forest by the murderers the
<>boy was roaming about when the King af Kalinda on [Page173-a+ 65]
<>a hunting expedition saw the destitute boy, and taking
<>pity on him took him back with him to the palace.
<>The boy was put under the care of Medha1vati1, the
<>King's consort. The king named him Candraha1sa. Since
<>the King took a special interest in the education of
<>the child he became adept in all arts and sciences. At
<>the age of twelve Candraha1sa, with the permission of
<>the king, set out on a triumphal tour, and the king
<>welcomed Candraha1sa on his return after his glorious
<>victory that brought him wealth.
<NI>At the instance of the Kalinda king, Candraha1sa, sent by
<>his messengers tribute to the Kaun2d2ala king, who, under-
<>standing from them that so much of wealth had been
<>brought to the Kalinda king by Candraha1sa started at
<>once for the Kalinda palace. On being told the whole
<>story about Candraha1sa, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, the minister of
<>the King of Kaun2d2ala made up his mind to do away with
<>him somehow or other for which he despatched a letter
<>to his son, Madana, through Candraha1sa.
<NI>Candraha1sa on his way to Kaun2d2ala slept on the banks
<>of a river. Campakama1lini1, the daughter of the King
<>of Kaun2d2ala and Vis2aya1, daughter of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi
<>happened to go to the river bank where Candraha1sa
<>was sleeping. Campakama1lini1, who became subject to
<>great love for Candraha1sa removed the anklets on her
<>feet and approached him slowly, and when she took up
<>and read a letter she found lying beside him, she felt
<>awe and sorrow to find therein a suggestion to poison
<>him to death. Without wasting much time in thought she
<>changed the word ‘vis2amasmai’ (give him poison) to
<>‘Vis2aya1smai’ (give him Vis2aya1) and put it in its former
<>place. After some time when Candraha1sa awoke from
<>sleep and reached Kaun2d2ala city and delivered the letter
<>to Madana its content pleased him very much. As for
<>Vis2aya1, she was spending her days in constant prayer
<>that Candraha1sa should marry her. In the cir-
<>cumstances the marriage of Candraha1sa and Vis2aya1 was
<>solemnised on the earliest auspicious day.
<NI>In due course Dhr2s2t2abuddhi returned to Kaun2d2ala with
<>all the wealth he could lay his hands upon after capturing
<>Kalinda. He seethed with grief and rage at the news
<>that Vis2aya1 had been married to Candraha1sa. All the
<>explanations offered by Madana did not satisfy him. He
<>persisted in his determination to kill Candraha1sa.
<NI>The evil-minded Dhr2s2t2abuddhi one day asked Candra-
<>ha1sa to go and worship at the Devi1 temple after having
<>made arrangements for his murder there. But, as fate
<>would have it, it was Madana who, instead of Candra-
<>ha1sa, was killed. Even before the above incident had
<>happened the Kaun2dala King had married his daughter
<>Candrama1lini1 to Candraha1sa, and after relinquishing
<>the kingdom also in his favour the King took to the forest
<>to lead a hermit's life.
<NI>The above developments added fuel to the fire of anger
<>in respect of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi, and when he saw in the
<>temple precincts, his son's corpse he became well-nigh
<>mad. Crying out that all this was the result of his having
<>troubled the Vais2n2ava Candraha1sa he dashed his head
<>against the pillars of the temple and died.
<NI>Candraha1sa was grieved over the death of Dhr2s2t2abuddhi.
<>He worshipped Devi1 offering his flesh in the sacrificial
<>fire. Devi1 appeared and granted him two boons which
<>helped him to bring Dhr2s2t2abuddhi and Madana back to
<>life. And, when the Kalinda king and his wife, fearing the
<>wicked Dhr2s2t2abuddhi were about to end their lives in [Page173-b+ 65]
<>flaming fire, Dhr2s2t2abuddhi went to them and imparted
<>to them the secrets about the life of Candraha1sa. The
<>Kalinda king and his wife dropped their former decision
<>to end their life, and Candraha1sa took up the reins of
<>government at the behest of the King. Candraha1sa,
<>who won repute as a very powerful and effective ruler,
<>during the As4vamedha sacrifice of Yudhis2t2hira captured
<>the sacrificial horse, and Arjuna, at the instance of
<>Kr2s2n2a had to enter into a pact with Candraha1sa, who
<>promised him help for the success of the sacrifice. Candra-
<>ha1sa had a son called Makara1ks2a by Vis2aya1 and another
<>son, Padma1ks2a by Campakama1lini1.
<HI>CANDRAHA1SA (M). Ra1van2a's sword. Ra1van2a, in the
<>course of his triumphal tour after receiving the boons
<>from Brahman, subjugated kings, and marching north-
<>ward reached the valleys of Mount Kaila1sa. But, Nandi-
<>kes4vara stopped him there, and Ra1van2a, threatening to
<>throw away S4iva, master of Nandikes4vara along with
<>Kaila1sa, put his twenty hands under it to pull it out,
<>and the great mountain shook violently. Pa1rvati1 got
<>frightened and running upto S4iva embraced him.
<>S4iva, who divined the reason for all these with his eye of
<>supreme knowledge grounded the mountain firmly on
<>earth, crushing Ra1van2a's hands under it. Unable to
<>take away his arms from under the mountain, Ra1van2a
<>remained there for about thousand years singing the
<>praises of the Lord. At last S4iva appeared to Ra1van2a
<>and presented him with a sword called Candraha1sa.
<>It was this sword which won victories for Ra1van2a in
<>future wars. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU I. A son of S4atrughna, brother of S4ri1
<>Ra1ma. S4atrughna had two sons. An3gada and Candra-
<>ketu by his wife S4rutaki1rti (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRAKETU II. A vidya1dhara King. See Mukta1-
<>phalaketu).
<HI>CANDRAMAS. A r2s2i who imparted spiritual knowledge
<>to Sampa1ti and advised Jat2a1yu to give directions about
<>the way to the monkeys in their search for Si1ta1devi1.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CA1NDRAMASI1. Ta1ra1, the wife of Br2haspati. She fell in
<>love with Candra and lived with him for sometime, and
<>came to be called Ca1ndramasi1. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 219; see also Ta1ra1).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 I. Wife of king Haris4candra reputed for
<>his unique honesty and integrity. (See Haris4candra).
<HI>CANDRAMATI1 II. A city. Two sons, Taks2aka and
<>Citraketu were born to Laks2man2a of U1rmila1. Taks2aka
<>was crowned King of Agati, a city built on the eastern
<>coast of the sea after annihilating the hunter tribe there,
<>and Citraketu was crowned king of Candramati1, a city
<>built on the western coast of the sea after killing all the
<>Mlecchas there. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CANDRA1N3GADA. Grandson of Nala. He married
<>Si1mantini1, daughter of Citravarman, a king of A1rya1varta.
<>Si1mantini1, hearing about Candra1n3gada fell in love
<>with him, and it was with the help of Maitreyi1, wife of
<>Ya1jn5avalkya, that she was wedded to him.
<NI>While once Candra1n3gada was enjoying a boat-race in
<>Ka1lindi1 (river) with his friends a storm upset the boat
<>and most of them were drowned to death. The servants
<>of Taks2aka saw Candra1n3gada sinking to the bottom
<>of the river and carried him to Pa1ta1la and he stayed
<>there for sometime in the midst of amorous na1ga damsels.
<>Candra1n3gada's people, under the impression that he
<>had died, performed his funeral rites, and Si1mantini1 [Page174-a+ 65]
<>took to widow's life. Enemies captured his kingdom
<>and imprisoned his father, Indrasena. When once the
<>na1ga King asked Candra1n3gada to marry na1ga girls and
<>settle down in Pa1ta1la he told the King that he was already
<>married and that his wife Si1mantini1 was brooding over
<>him, and he had, therefore, to return to her. Accordingly
<>the na1ga king sent him back with presents of a white
<>horse, a Ra1ks2asa and an infant serpent.
<NI>Candra1n3gada, with his presents, came up in Ka1lindi1
<>where Si1mantini1, grief-stricken was spending her days
<>in penance, and they recognised each other. Informed
<>about the return of Candra1n3gada the enemy kings releas-
<>ed his father from captivity and apologised to him.
<>And he pardoned them.
<NI>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 took great interest in observ-
<>ing somava1ravrata (fasting etc. on Mondays) and pleased
<>at the vrata of the latter S4ri1 Pa1rvati1 blessed her. Two
<>brahmins called Devamitra and Sa1rasvata were living
<>there at the time. Three sons called Sumedha, Sa1rasvata
<>and Sa1mava1n were born to Devamitra. The sons also
<>turned out to be great scholars but they were poor.
<>They could not get brides as they were poor. In the
<>hope that they would get some money if they approached
<>Candra1n3gada and Si1mantini1 the brahmins went to
<>them. After hearing their story the king and his queen
<>conducted them in a procession in the precincts of the
<>palace, Sumedha dressed as husband and Sa1mava1n
<>as his wife. But, lo! when the procession was over
<>Sa1mava1n could not be divested of his womanhood, and
<>Si1mantini1 named her Sa1mavati1. Being told that his
<>son had turned woman Sa1rasvata sought the advice of
<>some munis to remedy the situation. But, all the attempts
<>of the munis to change the woman to man failed, and
<>they opined that only Pa1rvati1, who had been pleased
<>by the Somava1ravrata, would be able to find a solution
<>to the problem. From that day onwards the brahmin
<>youths lived as husband and wife. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Soma-
<>va1ravratam).
<HI>CANDRA1PI1D2A. A son of Janamejaya. Pari1ks2it was the
<>son of Abhimanyu (Arjuna's son). Janamejaya was
<>Pari1ks2it's son. Janamejaya married princess Vapus2t2ama1
<>of Ka1s4i. Two sons called Candra1pi1d2a and Su1rya1pi1d2a
<>were born to the couple. Candra1pi1d2a had hundred sons,
<>who distinguished themselves as great heroes in archery.
<>Satyakarn2a was the eldest among the sons. S4vetakarn2a,
<>son of Satyakarn2a, married Ya1davi1, the daughter of
<>Suca1ru. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA. (See Su1ryaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAPRABHA1. Mother of the wonderful girl,
<>Somaprabha1. (See Somaprabha1).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 I. A great sinner, who killed his
<>preceptor. The Padma Pura1n2a relates the story of four
<>sinners named Vidura, Candras4arman, Vedas4arman
<>and Van5jula, who shed their sin by bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1. The sins committed by the four were respectively
<>Brahmahatya1 (killing of brahmin), Guruhatya1 (killing
<>of the preceptor), Agamya1gamana (having sexual con-
<>tact with women like the wife of guru which is debarred)
<>and Govadha (killing of cow) respectively. The leader
<>of the above four sinners was one Vidura of the Pa1n5ca1la
<>des4a. He was begging in the streets without the tuft
<>of hair, the sacred thread and tilaka (mark of sandal
<>paste etc. on the forehead). He went from house to
<>house begging for alms crying thus: “Here is come the
<>man (himself) who committed Brahmahatya1. Please [Page174-b+ 65]
<>give alms to the brahmin-killer who is a drunkard also.”
<>During his begging tour he visited all the ti1rthas also,
<>yet brahmahatya1 stuck on to him.
<NI>While this sinner Vidura, his heart rent with sorrow and
<>remorse, was sitting under a tree, a Ma1gadha brahmin
<>called Candras4arman happened to come there. This
<>brahmin had committed the sin of guruhatya1 (killing the
<>preceptor). He told Vidura:--“While residing with the
<>guru, blinded by desire, I killed the guru, and am now
<>burning myself in the fire of repentance.”
<NI>While they were engaged thus in conversation a third
<>person, called Vedas4arman also came there in an absolu-
<>tely tired condition. He told Vidura and Candras4arman
<>that his relatives and others had cast him out as he once
<>did the sin of agamya1gamana, and by the time he had
<>finished telling his story a Vais4ya called Van5jula came
<>there. Besides drinking liquor he had committed govadha
<>(killing of cow) also. Though these four sinners assemb-
<>led at the same place, they only talked, but did not touch
<>one another, take food together, rest on the same seat
<>or lie on the same bedsheet.
<NI>According to the advice of a Siddha (an evolved soul)
<>the four sinners dived in the holy waters of Gan3ga1 and
<>came out redeemed of their sins. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 91).
<HI>CANDRAS4ARMA1 II. A brahmin of Agni gotra from
<>Ma1ya1pura, he was the disciple and son-in-law of Deva-
<>s4arman. Both of them were killed by a Ra1ks2asa while
<>they were gathering darbha (a particular variety of
<>grass used in religious ceremonies) in the forest. Candra-
<>s4arma1 attained Vaikun2t2ha as he was a very righteous
<>person. During Kr2s2n2a1vata1ra (incarnation of Vis2n2u
<>as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a) he was born as Acru1ra. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CANDRAS4EKHARA. A King (son of Paus2ya). The
<>following story about his birth is told in the Padma
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>Though married for a long time Paus2ya did not have an
<>issue. He began worshipping S4iva to be blessed with a
<>son. S4iva was pleased at this and he gave him a fruit
<>which he divided equally among his three wives. In
<>due course the three wives delivered. But, to get the
<>full and complete form of a child the three children had to
<>be joined together, and so the parts were unified. This
<>boy was Candras4ekhara. Thus Candras4ekhara acquired
<>the name Tryam3baka.
<NI>Candras4ekhara married Ta1ra1vati1, daughter of Kaku-
<>tstha, a King of the solar dynasty. On account of the
<>curse of Kapotamuni two sons, Bhr2n3gi and Maha1ka1la
<>were born to Ta1ra1vati1 in Veta1la yoni and Bhairava
<>yoni respectively. Dama, Uparicara and Alarka were
<>sons born to Candras4ekhara himself. (Aurasaputras).
<HI>CANDRASENA I. A king of Sim3hala des4a (Ceylon).
<>Candrasena had two daughters, Mandodari1 and Indu-
<>mati1 by his wife Gun2avati1. Kambugri1va, son of Sudh-
<>anva1, the chief of Ma1dra desired to marry Mandodari1.
<>But, since she preferred unmarried life Kambugri1va's
<>desire did not fructify. Some time later she refused to
<>marry another suitor also, King Vi1rasena of Kosala.
<>Meanwhile the marriage of her younger sister, Indumati1
<>was celebrated, herself having selected Sudes2n2a, the
<>Ma1dra prince at the Svayam3vara as husband. Though a
<>handsome person Sudes2n2a was a philanderer, and one
<>day Indumati1 saw him in bed with her maid-servant.
<>From that day onwards, cutting asunder all marital
<>relationship with Sudes2n2a, Indumati1 went and stayed [Page175-a+ 64]
<>with her father. This story told by Mahis2a1sura to show
<>that women possess only very little discretion occurs in
<>the Pan5cama Skandha of Devi1bha1gavata.
<HI>CANDRASENA II. A king of Ujjayani1 and a great
<>devotee of S4iva. As he performed great sacrifices and
<>gave away money and materials in gift to those who pray-
<>ed for them, an attendant of S4iva called Man2ibhadra
<>once gave him a gem, which possessed supernatural
<>powers. Attracted by the lustre and glare of the gem
<>many kings wanted to purchase it. But Candrasena
<>refused to sell it. Much incensed at the refusal, the enemy
<>kings set out to fight Candrasena, who then took refuge
<>in the Maha1ka1la temple in Ujjayani1 the idol installed in
<>which was S4ivalin3ga. Lord S4iva then appeared to him
<>and granted him salvation. (S4iva Pura1n2a, S4aniprado-
<>s2ama1ha1tmyam).
<HI>CANDRASENA III. The Maha1bha1rata refers to another
<>Candrasena, son of Samudrasena, King of Bengal. He
<>was present at the svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 185, Verse 11). Bhi1masena once defeat-
<>ed Candrasena and his father in fight. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 30, Verse 24). After that Candrasena became a
<>supporter of the Pa1n2d2avas. It is stated in Dron2a Parva
<>that in the great war Candrasena fought from a chariot
<>drawn by horses as white as Candra (moon) and got
<>killed by As4vattha1ma1.
<HI>CANDRASENA IV. Another Candrasena, a partisan of
<>the Kauravas, is referred to in the Bha1rata as having
<>fought against the Pa1n2d2avas. His duty was to guard the
<>chariot wheels of S4alya; he was killed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4alya Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 52).
<HI>CANDRASI1TA1. A female attendant of Skandadeva.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 11).
<HI>CANDRAS4RI1. A woman, who, though actually in love
<>with her husband enjoyed life with her paramour.
<>Candras4ri1 is the heroine of a story narrated in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara to prove that the interest married women take
<>in clandestine relationship is only due to fleeting temp-
<>tations. Candras4ri1 was the wife of a vais4ya called Ba1la-
<>varman, who lived in the city of Pratis2t2ha1na. One day,
<>looking out through the windows in her house she saw
<>the very handsome vais4ya youth called S4i1laha1ra and
<>felt great desire for him. She brought him secretly to
<>the house of her companion and satisfied her desire.
<>When their meeting became a routine affair her relations
<>and servants knew about it. And, her husband alone was
<>unaware of it. Once he became ill with severe fever.
<>Even while he was in his death-bed Candras4ri1 continued
<>her affair with the paramour. When one day she was
<>with her paramour thus, she was told that her husband
<>was no more. At once she took leave of him, returned
<>home and committed suicide by jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of the husband. (Katha1saritsa1gara, S4aktiyas4olam-
<>baka, Taran3ga 2).
<HI>CANDRA1S4VA (M). Son of King Kuvalaya1s4va of the
<>Iks2va1ku dynasty. He had two brothers called Dr2d2ha1s4va
<>and Kapila1s4va. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 24).
<HI>CANDRASVA1MI1. A brahmin, who got back his life by
<>worshipping Su1rya. He stayed with his wife, Devamati1
<>in Kamalapura ruled by King Kamalavarman. A son
<>called Mahi1pa1la was born to him, and at the time of the
<>birth of the child a celestial voice declared that Mahi1pa1la
<>would become King. A few years later a daughter called
<>Candramati1 also was born to Candrasva1mi1. [Page175-b+ 65]
<>During this period, rains having failed, very severe
<>famine stalked Kamalapura. Even the king unmindful of
<>justice and righteousness began extracting from the
<>people whatever they possessed. Finding the situation
<>deteriorated so much Candrasva1mi1 set out for his father-
<>in-law's house with Mahi1pa1la and Candramati1, and on
<>the way they had to cross what was once a wild forest,
<>but which had by then been denuded of green trees or
<>other foliage due to the failure of the rains. The children
<>were severely afflicted by thirst, and so the father, after
<>leaving them at the foot of a tree went in search of water
<>when he was caught by the people of the forest king and
<>taken before him. When he knew that he was about to
<>be given in sacrifice to Devi1 the brahmin folded his
<>hands and prayed to Su1ryadeva, who appeared before
<>him and assured him that not only will death not visit
<>him, but also he would be united with his wife and
<>children.
<NI>The children left under the tree began crying, their
<>father having not returned to them, and a Vais4ya called
<>Sa1rthadha1ra who came that way felt pity for the crying
<>children and took them to his house. One day
<>Anantasva1mi1, a brahmin and a minister of King
<>Ta1ra1na1tha of Ta1ra1pura happened to visit Sa1rthadha1ra.
<>Anantasva1mi1, who had no children of his own took away
<>with him the children from Sa1rthadha1ra.
<NI>One day Su1ryadeva appeared to the forest king in his
<>sleep and asked him not to kill the brahmin (Candra-
<>sva1mi) held captive by him. The very next morning
<>Candrasva1mi1 was released from captivity. Roaming
<>about in quest of his children, Candrasva1mi1 reached the
<>city called Jalapura where he was put up as the guest
<>of a house-holder. One day the host told Candrasva1mi1
<>that a vais4ya called Kanakavarman had, a few days back,
<>told him that he (Kanakavarman) had got two children,
<>one male and the other female from the forest, and taken
<>them to the Na1likera island. The very next day Candra-
<>sva1mi1, along with a vais4ya called Vis2n2uvarman arrived
<>at the Na1likera island, and on enquiry they were told
<>that Kanakavarman, with the children had left for
<>Kat2a1ha island. They then went to Kat2a1ha island only
<>to be told that Kanakavarman had gone to Karpu1ra
<>island. With another Vais4ya Candrasva1mi landed on the
<>Karpu1ra island to no purpose. After thus going to the
<>Suvarn2a and Sim3hala islands too Candrasva1mi met
<>Kanakavarman at Citraku1t2apura. Kanakavarman
<>showed the children to Candrasva1mi, but they were not
<>his. He burst into tears, and returned from Citraku1t2a-
<>pura. He passed on his way back many a temple and
<>city and at dusk reached a big forest. He satisfied his
<>hunger by eating some roots and fruits, and got upon
<>a tree and sat on the top of it. It was mid-night, yet
<>sleep did not oblige him. Then he saw a ma1tr2san3gha
<>(a group of women) consisting of Na1ra1yan2i1 and others
<>come and dance at the foot of the tree. Na1ra1yan2i1 saw
<>Candrasva1mi1 and after the dance was over and her
<>companions had left the place Na1ra1yan2i1 called him down
<>from the tree and gave him a flower. And, according
<>to the advice of Na1ra1yan2i1 the next day morning Candra-
<>sva1mi1 went to Ta1ra1pura where, accidentally he got into
<>the house of Anantasva1mi1, minister of the kingdom, and,
<>for food, repeated vedic hymns. The minister invited him
<>for meals, and there he saw Mahi1pa1la and Candra1vati1.
<>He placed the flower presented by Na1ra1yan2i1 on Mahi1-
<>pa1la's nose whereupon the children recognised him, [Page176-a+ 65]
<>their father. The people celebrated it as a happy day.
<>King Ta1ra1varman gave his daughter, Vasumati1, in
<>marriage to Mahi1pa1la along with half his kingdom.
<>They went to Kamalapura and returned with their
<>mother. All of them spent their days very happily at
<>Ta1ra1pura. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Alan3ka1ravati1 Lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 6).
<HI>CANDRA1VALOKA. A King of Citraku1t2anagara.
<NI>When once the King in the course of a hunting expedition
<>came to the bank of a river tired and done up he saw
<>there the very beautiful lady, Indi1varaprabha1, daughter
<>of Mahars2i Kan2va by Menaka1. Having fallen in love
<>with each other they went to the a1s4rama of the mahars2i
<>where, at his instance, Candra1valoka took the pledge not
<>to kill animals in future, and Kan2va married his daugh-
<>ter to the King. On their way back to the palace the
<>couple went to sleep on the banks of a pool which be-
<>longed to a Brahmaraks2as, who caught hold of them,
<>but released them on condition that they gave him in
<>their stead a brahmin boy aged seven. Thus they re-
<>turned to Citraku1t2a and told about the incident to
<>minister Sumati. As advised by Sumati an idol in gold
<>equal in size to a brahmin boy aged seven was made and
<>a proclamation was issued that the golden idol would
<>be given to him who, in return, give a brahmin boy
<>seven years old. A brahmin boy was got, and he was
<>given to the Brahmaraks2as. (Katha1saritsa1gara S4as4a1n3ka-
<>vati1 Lam3baka, Taran3ga 27).
<HI>CANDRAVAM3S4A. A royal dynasty the kings of which
<>ruled India for a long time. Since the founding father
<>of the dynasty was Candra all the kings in the dynasty
<>came to be called Candravam3s4ara1ja. (For Candra's
<>birth see Puru1ravas). A chronological list of the kings
<>of this dynasty is given infra.
<NI>Descended from Candra thus, Budha--Puru1ravas--
<>A1yus--Nahus2a. Nahus2a had two sons, A1yati and
<>Yaya1ti. Yaya1ti had three sons: Druhyu, Anudruhyu
<>and Pu1ru by his wife S4armis2t2ha1, and two sons, Yadu and
<>Turvasu by his wife Devaya1ni1. The genealogy of each
<>of them is given below.
<NI>1) {%Druhyu:%}--Descended from Druhyu thus:--Babhru--
<>Setu--A1ran2ya--Gandharva--Dharma--Ghr2ta--Dur-
<>dama--Pracetas--Mlecchas.
<NI>2) {%Anudruhyu:%}--Three sons, Sabha1nara, Caks2us2 and
<>Paroks2a were born to Anudruhyu. Sabha1nara begot
<>Ka1lanara, and he Sr2n5jaya. Sr2n5jaya had four sons:
<>(a) Janamejaya, (b) Maha1manas, (c) Us4i1nara and (d)
<>Titiks2a. Us4i1nara and Titiks2a proved to be family pro-
<>genitors. Their genealogy is given below:--
<NI>{%c) Us4i1nara.%} Us4i1nara had five sons: S4ibi, Vena, Kr2mi,
<>Us4i and Darpa of whom S4ibi begot five sons: Bhadra--
<>Suvi1ra--Kekaya--Vr2s2adarpa and Kapotaroma1, and
<>from Kekaya was born the Ki1cakas.
<NI>{%d) Titiks2a.%} Descended from Titiks2a were: Kr2s4ad-
<>ratha--Homa--Sutapas and Bali, and Bali had seven
<>sons: Anagha1bhu1--An3ga--Kalin3ga--Suhva--Pun2d2ra--
<>Van3ga and Adru1pa. Of the seven sons An3ga turned out
<>to be the family progenitor, and thenceforth the An3ga
<>royal dynasty starts its course. To An3ga were born the
<>following sons: Dadhiva1hana--Raviratha--Dharma-
<>ratha--Citraratha--Satyaratha--Lomapa1da--Catu-
<>ran3ga--Pr2thu--Campa--Haryan3ga and Bhadraratha,

<>selling the gold. The poor Brahmin did not even know
<>how to go on tour. Then the Vit2a advised him to visit a

<NI>Brahmin:--What shall I do first after going to the
<>harlot's house?
<NI>Vit2a:--Caturika1 will become friendly if you would
<>give her the gold. Then you should use sweet and charm-
<>ing words, and that is all.
<NI>The Brahmin went immediately to Caturika1's house and
<>he was received honourably by her. Then giving the
<>gold to her he requested her to instruct him about going
<>on tour. This request of his evoked laughter from people
<>around him. Then the Brahmin who was versed in the
<>S4rutis began reciting the Sa1man with his palm formed
<>in the shape of the ears of the cow. All those who were
<>present there wildly laughed at him, and somehow or
<>other he escaped from the none too pleasant scene, and
<>reported his experience at the harlot's to the Vit2a.
<>He very easily understood that the reason for the Brah-
<>min being ridiculed was that misreading his advice to
<>use ‘sa1ma’ (sweet words) the Brahmin recited the sa1ma-
<>veda. He took the brahmin back to Caturika1 and asked
<>her to return the ‘grass’ (gold given her by the brah-
<>min) to ‘the cow’, the Brahmin who was as simple as
<>the cow. Laughingly Caturika1 returned the gold to

<>became enamoured of that girl and showed an unbe-
<>coming passion. As a punishment for this sin one of his
<>heads broke. Thus broken-headed Brahma1, went to
<>the Stha1n2uti1rtha, which washes off all sins, on the north-
<>ern bank of Sarasvati1 and installed his own lin3ga, known
<>as the Caturmukhalin3ga. This installation of lin3ga
<>redeemed him from sins. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 49).
<HI>CATURTHI1VRATA. A fast undertaken so that one
<>may be happy for one year, may achieve all desires and

<>Next day the fast should be broken by eating cooked
<>rice and oil seeds. The Mu1lamantra of Gan2apati is
<>‘gam3 sva1ha1’; hr2daya1dis2ad2an3gas beginning with ‘gam’.
<>‘A1gaccha1tika1ya’ is the a1va1hana mantra and ‘Gaccha1-
<>tika1ya’ the visarjana mantra. Gan2apati should be
<>worshipped with mantras ending with ‘tun3ka1ya’ and
<>beginning with ‘gaka1ra’ as also with offering of sandal
<>paste, rice balls etc. “Om3 Mahotka1ya1ya vidmahe vakra-
<>tun2d2a1ya dhi1mahi tanno danti1 pracodaya1t” is the Gan2es4a
<>ga1yatri1 mantra. He or she who performs the Caturthi1
<>vrata will attain S4ivaloka. If Gan2apati is worshipped
<>on a Tuesday which is also Caturthi1 the devotee will
<>get all his desires satisfied. Caturthi1 occurring in Mi1na
<>(March-April) is called Avighnacaturthi1, and that day
<>fasting should be in the night. On Caturthi1 in April-
<>May Gan2apati should be worshipped with damanaka [Page179-b+ 65]
<>flowers, and then the worshipper will become very
<>happy. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 179). Also see Vina1yaka
<>Caturthi1.
<HI>CATURUPA1YAM. The four means used by Kings in
<>olden times to achieve their objects are called Caturu-
<>pa1yam. Sa1ma, da1na, bheda and dan2d2a are the Catur-
<>upa1yas (four tactics). There are three other upa1yas
<>also, almost equally important as the first four, and the
<>seven upa1yas are collectively called Saptopa1yas. There
<>are also yet other upa1yas, but they are not important
<>enough to merit special mention.
<NI>1) {%Sa1ma.%} It is the best means to attract and convert
<>others to one's side. It consists in winning people with
<>sweet words and looks. People who are friendly by
<>temperament and straightforward may be brought
<>round by sa1ma. Sa1ma is employed in dealing with sons,
<>brothers and other relatives.
<NI>2) {%Da1na.%} There are five kinds or varieties of da1na
<>(gift) viz. pri1tida1na, dravyada1na, svayam3gra1ha, deya
<>and pratimoks2a. If a person gets help from another
<>and acknowledges help by reward that reward is
<>called pri1tida1na. The miser and the poor should be
<>brought round by pri1tida1na. Military captains, heroes
<>and citizens should be won over by this da1na. Those
<>who fall at feet should be honoured by da1na.
<NI>3) {%Bheda.%} Bhedopa1ya is of three kinds: to destroy or
<>end the friendship subsisting between people, to create
<>dissension and to make the parties quarrel with each
<>other. He who is falsely praised, he who does not desire
<>wealth or welfare, he who has been invited to come and
<>then insulted, traitor to king, he who has been exorbi-
<>tantly taxed, the angry one, the honourable one, the
<>insulted, the unreasonably forsaken one, he who har-
<>bours hatred in his mind, the pacified one, one whose
<>wealth and wife have been taken away or stolen, he
<>who has not been respected though deserving of respect--
<>if such people are in one's opposite camp, suspicion
<>should be raked up among them and thus division crea-
<>ted in their ranks. If subordinate chieftains, and forest
<>tribes commit offences they should be brought round
<>by the use of sa1ma and bheda upa1yas.
<NI>4) {%Dan2d2a.%} Dan2d2opa1ya is of three kinds, viz, killing,
<>denuding of wealth, and inflicting pain on the body or
<>torture. Dan2d2a has two other forms, praka1s4a (open)
<>and apraka1s4a (secret). Those who have become objects
<>of hatred to all people should be subjected to praka1s4a-
<>dan2d2a. People, whose killing the world will detest,
<>should not be killed openly, but only secretly. Enemies
<>should be killed with weapons etc. Brahmins should not
<>be killed. Friends and allies should not be subjected
<>to dan2d2a; friends, who are made objects of dan2d2a will
<>wither away like worm-eaten trees. The King, who
<>possesses the three powers (of wealth, army and people's
<>support) and is fully conscious of the time and environ-
<>mental factors should annihilate enemies by the instru-
<>ment of dan2d2a. Evil people should be defeated by
<>dan2d2a itself.
<NI>The upa1ya ma1ya1 consists in practising deception by
<>magic or other yogic powers. The powers can be
<>acquired by the worship of the idols of certain Devata1s.
<>People who employ go about at night in various dis-
<>guises. They disguise themselves as beautiful women or
<>even as animals. They also deceive people by creating
<>illusions of clouds, fire or lightning. For instance, Bhi1ma
<>killed Ki1caka by going to him in the guise of a woman. [Page180-a+ 65]
<>Not to dissuade people who indulge in unjustifiable
<>grief, war etc. is the principal aim of the upa1ya called
<>upeks2a1. Hid2imbi1 gave up his brother Hidimba by
<>practising Upeks2a1. Next is the Indraja1lopa1ya (magic).
<>For example, to create illusions of clouds, darkness, rain,
<>fire, and other magic in order to instil fear among
<>troops of the enemy etc. To scare the enemy is the aim
<>of Indraja1la. (For details of Caturupa1yas see Kan2ika).
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 241).
<HI>CA1TURVARN2YAM. (The four Castes, Classes).
<NI>1) {%General.%} The pura1n2as tell that Brahma1 created the
<>four castes like Brahmins, Ks2atriyas, Vais4yas and S4u1dras
<>and assigned to them duties and rules of procedure.
<NI>2) {%Origin.%} Brahma1 got ready for the work of Crea-
<>tion, concentrating his mind on the universal soul, the
<>embodiment of Truth. And, the first to be born from his
<>face were people with sublime qualities, and them he
<>called Brahmins. Then emerged from his chest people
<>in whom the heroic or militant qualities preponderated.
<>(Ra1jasa). Them the Creator named Ks2atriyas. Then
<>from his thighs were born people in whom rajas and
<>tamas preponderated, and they were called Vais4yas.
<>And, lastly Brahma1 brought forth from his feet another
<>sect of people, and as tamas (darkness, cultural darkness)
<>preponderated in them they were named S4u1dras. The
<>system of four castes is called Ca1turvarn2yam. (Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 6).
<NI>3) {%Code of conduct.%} Ahim3sa1 (non-violence), Satyava1da
<>(speaking truth), Bhu1tada1ya (love for all living beings),
<>Ti1rthaseva1 (resort to holy places), Da1na (gifts), Brahma-
<>carya (celibacy), Vimatsaratva (absence of malice),
<>Service of Devas, Brahmins and Gurus (elders), to attend
<>to all dharmas (duties), Pitr2pu1ja1 (worship of elders)
<>eternal loyalty to King, to accomplish objects in con-
<>formity with the injunction of the S4a1stras, not to commit
<>cruel deeds, Titiks2a1 (forbearance, to put up with
<>equanimity the pair of opposites such as pleasure and
<>pain, heat and cold), belief in God--these codes of con-
<>duct are common to all Castes and in all the four stations
<>in life. Now, the special codes for each of the four
<>castes.
<NI>1) {%Brahmins.%} To perform and get performed Yajn5as,
<>to study and to teach the Vedas, to give gifts and to
<>receive gifts--these form the dharma (duties) of the
<>Brahmin. Brahmins take their second birth (dvija)
<>on the upanayana (wearing of the sacred thread).
<>The caste of the mother is the caste of the child. But
<>children born to Brahmins of their non-Brahmin wives
<>are not Brahmins. Children born of a Brahmin woman
<>to a S4u1dra1 are called Can2d2a1las. Sons born of Brahmin
<>women to Ks2atriyas are called Su1tas, and sons born of a
<>Brahmin woman to a Vais4ya are called Vaidehikas.
<>The Brahmin shall not adopt the profession of the other
<>castes. The twice-born are, however, allowed in certain
<>circumstances, the profession of agriculture, protection
<>of cows, commerce and kusi1da (to lend money on inte-
<>rest). But, he shall not trade in gorasa (milk and other
<>cow products) lavan2a (salt) and flesh. If he be an
<>agriculturist, the Brahmin may till the earth, cut medi-
<>cinal plants and destroy pests. But, he must purify the
<>soul by performing yajn5as and worshipping Devas.
<>The soil should be ploughed with eight oxen attached to
<>the plough. He may sustain himself either with R2ta
<>(food got by begging) or Amr2ta (food got not by beg-
<>ging). The suffix “S4arma1” should be added to the names [Page180-b+ 64]
<>of Brahmin children. Upanayana (wearing of the sacred
<>thread) should be done when the child is eight years
<>old. The maun5ji (girdle around the waist) to be worn
<>after upanayana should be made either of mun5ja grass
<>or of the bark of trees. Brahmin brahmaca1rins should
<>wear hides, and when they beg for alms the sentence
<>should commence with the word ‘Bhavati’, e.g. “Bhavati,
<>bhiks2a1m3 dehi). The Brahmin can marry in all the castes,
<>but he shall perform ritual only along with the wife of
<>his own caste.
<NI>{%ii) Ks2atriya.%} To give gifts according to rules, study
<>Vedas and perform yajn5as form the duty of the Ks2atriya.
<>To look after and take care of good people and to punish
<>evil-doers are his especial duties. Names of Ks2atriya
<>children should take the suffix “Varma1”. After upana-
<>yana the child should wear tiger skin. He should carry
<>a dan2d2a (rod) of the Araya1l (peepal) tree. When the
<>Ks2atriya brahmaca1rin begs for alms the word ‘bhavati’
<>should be used in the middle of the sentence, e.g. “Bhiks2a1m3
<>bhavati dehi”. The Ks2atriya can marry in the other
<>castes, except the Brahmin. At the time of wedding the
<>Ks2atriya woman should hold an arrow in her hand.
<NI>{%iii) Vais4ya.%} Agriculture, protection of cows and trade
<>are the special duties of the Vais4ya. Children born of
<>Brahmin women to Vais4yas are called Vaidehikas.
<>Names of Vais4ya children should have the suffix ‘gupta’
<>after them. After upanayana the Vais4ya brahmaca1rin
<>should wear sheep's skin. He should carry a dan2d2a made
<>of a branch of the Ku1vala tree. The Vais4ya may have a
<>wife of his own caste and one of the S4u1dra caste. At
<>the time of wedding the Vais4ya woman should hold a
<>cane in her hand.
<NI>{%iv) S4u1dra.%} Service to the Brahmin and architecture
<>form the duties of the S4u1dra. Children born to Ks2atriya
<>women by S4u1dras are called Pulkasas. Children born
<>to Brahmin women by S4u1dras are called Can2d2a1las,
<>and sons born to S4u1dras by Vais4ya women are called
<>A1yogavas.
<NI>The Can2d2a1la's profession is to hang criminals sentenced
<>to death, and to live by women. The Pulkasa must
<>live by hunting. A1yogava is to act on the stage and live
<>by architecture. The Can2d2a1la should live outside the
<>village. The Can2d2a1la has a right to take the clothes on
<>corpses. He shall not have any physical contacts with
<>the others. He will attain salvation if he died in the
<>course of protecting others. The suffix ‘da1sa’ should be
<>added to his name. He shall marry only from his own
<>caste. (Agni Pura1n2a, 4 Chapters from 151).
<HI>CATURVEDA. One of the Saptapitr2s (seven manes).
<>Vaira1jas, agnis2va1ttas, ga1rhapatyas, somapa1s, Ekas4r2n3gas,
<>Caturvedas and Ka1las are the seven manes. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, Verse 47).
<HI>CATURYUGA. (See Manvantara).
<HI>CATUS2KAR2N2I1. One of the female attendants of Skanda-
<>deva. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 25).
<HI>CATUS2PATHARATA1. A female attendant of Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 27).
<HI>CATVARAVA1SINI1. A woman attendant of Skanda.
<>(M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 12).
<HI>CA1VET2T2UPAT2A. (CA1VERU). (Pat2a = army).
<NI>A particular division of the army which in olden days
<>used to come forward to lay down their lives in the
<>service of the country. When defeat in war was almost
<>certain for their king an army division under royal [Page181-a+ 64]
<>leadership was formed of heroes, who took their last
<>leave of their homes and people. The soldiers left their
<>homes with their head and eyebrows shaved, and people
<>gave them a hearty send-off. Either victory or death
<>in battlefield was their slogan. This system originated
<>in Kerala. Imitating Kerala, Turkey and Egypt formed
<>their own division of Ca1vet2t2upat2a in the 15th century.
<>The Ca1vet2t2upat2a of Turkey called the Janissary was
<>formed out of poor Christians captured in war, and that
<>of Egypt called Mamaluk was formed out of slaves.
<>But, the Ca1vet2t2upat2a of ancient Kerala was self-orga-
<>nised out of burning love for their king and country.
<>The families of those warriors of the pata who died in
<>fight were allotted royal favours. Even before, in the 14th
<>century A.D. there existed in Kerala this system of
<>Ca1vet2t2upat2a. From A.D. 1090 to 1111 A.D. many fierce
<>wars were fought between Kerala and the Cola country,
<>and it was perhaps during this period that this system of
<>fighting came into vogue. Certain inscriptions of the
<>period go to prove that Ra1mavarmakulas4ekhara Cakra-
<>varti who ruled Kerala during the above period drove
<>out the Colas from Quilon and captured places up to
<>Kot2t2ar.
<NI>Foreign writers have also referred to the Ca1vet2t2upat2a.
<>“Amouces” and “Amochi” used in the ‘Rise of Portu-
<>guese power in India’ indicate the Ca1vet2t2upat2a. “In
<>the war between Cochin and Calicut in 1504 three
<>princes of Cochin were killed, one of them being the
<>nephew of the ruling monarch. On his death 200
<>Ca1vet2t2u warriors who formed the body-guard of the
<>nephew rushed to the field after shaving their heads
<>and eyebrows and killed all the enemies they saw.”
<HI>CEDI. A king of the Yaduvam3s4a.

<HI>CEM3B(U). (COPPER). The sperm of Lord S4iva
<>which was dropped into the river Gan3ga1 developed into
<>form and gave birth to Subrahman2ya. Along with
<>Subrahman2ya came out from Gan3ga1 gold and silver

<>out tin. (Sarga 37, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>CENKAN2N2ARA1JA. See Jambukes4vara.
<HI>CENNA1SU NAM3BU1TIRI. Cenna1s Na1ra1yan2an

<HI>CERA. (A king of serpents). See under Ruru.
<HI>CERIPPU. (FOOTWEAR). There is a story in
<>Maha1bha1rata of how Cerippu and Kut2a (footwear and
<>umbrella) were born. Once the heat of the Sun be-
<>came unbearable to Jamadagni and enraged at this
<>the sage started sending arrows against the Sun. His
<>wife Ren2uka1 was supplying him with arrows. When a
<>set of arrows was finished Ren2uka1 brought another set.
<>This continued without break and the Sun began to
<>feel the attack. Unable to do anything against the sage
<>the Sun heated the head and foot of Ren2uka1 on her way
<>to supply the arrows so fiercely that Ren2uka1 fell down
<>under a banyan tree exhausted. When she became well
<>enough to walk she took the arrows to her husband who
<>was very angry for her being late. She then explained
<>to him how because of the extreme heat of the sun she
<>fell down on the way. Jamadagni then started with
<>increased fury his shower of arrows and the Sun in the
<>disguise of a Brahmin approached and advised him that it
<>was not possible to strike down the Sun because he was
<>a swift-mover in the sky and so it was better to withdraw
<>from that attempt. But Jamadagni said the Sun would [Page182-a+ 65]
<>be stationary for some time at midday and then he would
<>hit the Sun down. When the Sun found that Jamadagni
<>would never drop his attempt he accepted defeat and
<>presented Jamadagni with a pair of sandals and an
<>umbrella to protect against the heat from below and
<>above. From that day onwards footwear and umbrella
<>came into vogue.
<NI>The practice of presenting sandals and umbrella is
<>being carried down from generation to generation and

<>previous birth by this name. (See Matan3ga).
<HI>CHATRAKETU. The second son born to Laks2man2a
<>of his wife U1rmila1. The eldest son was Taks2aka. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma after his return from the exile established a
<>Kingdom called Agati on the eastern sea-shore and
<>crowned Taks2aka as the King of that place. On the wes-
<>tern side after subjugating the mlechhas (low-caste

<>called Candramati1 and installed Chatraketu as the King
<>of that country. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).

<HI>CHA1YA1. A substitute of Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4va-
<>karma1. Sam3jn5a1 got from Su1rya three children, Manu,
<>Yama and Yami1. The heat of Su1rya, her husband,
<>became unbearable to her and so she created a substitute
<>in her exact form and leaving her to look after Su1rya,
<>her husband, she left the place and went to her father.
<>Su1rya did not know of this replacement and taking her
<>to be Sam3jn5a1 he produced three children by her, S4ani,
<>Sa1varn2amanu and Tapati1. Cha1ya1 loved her sons more
<>and this made Yama angry and he raised his legs to
<>strike her when Cha1ya1 cursed that Yama's legs would fall
<>off from his body. Yama complained to his father and he
<>amended the curse and said that only some flesh from
<>his limbs would fall to the ground and that flesh would
<>serve as food to the germs in the earth. Yama would
<>escape from further injury. After consoling his son he
<>turned towards Cha1ya1. The anger of Su1rya frightened
<>her and she told him everything. Su1rya then divorced
<>her and brought back Sam3jn5a1. For details see Sam3jn5a1.

<>see the King. But due to the bad advice of his courtiers
<>the King did not care to see them even. For five years
<>they stayed there without even getting a look at the
<>King. One day the only son of the King died. All the
<>courtiers gathered round the child and pretended to
<>be greatly grieved. Prasan3ga and his friends also came
<>to the scene. They saw the king and spoke to him thus:
<>“For five years you have not cared either to see or talk to
<>us. We were cherishing a hope that at least your son
<>would give us a better treatment when he grew old and
<>became King. We were living here on that hope and now
<>that hope also has been shattered and so we are leaving
<>the place this instant.” The King was surprised to hear

<>Chapter 8, Karn2a Parva).
<HI>CIRAKA1RI1. A son of Gautama Mahars2i. He used to

<>name Ciraka1ri1.
<NI>Once the sage Gautama found out proof against the
<>chastity of his own wife and enraged at this commanded
<>his son Ciraka1ri1 to chop off the head of the latter's
<>mother. Giving this command Gautama went into the
<>forest and Ciraka1ri1 in obedience to his father's order
<>came before his mother, weapon in hand. He did not
<>kill her immediately but pondered over the consequences
<>of the deed. Matricide is a great sin, he mused. Then
<>again who would be there to look after father if mother
<>died. Perhaps his father, when he cools down, might
<>regret his command and come back repentant. Thus
<>he was sitting undecided when Gautama returned full
<>of remorse for his hasty order. On seeing his wife [Page183-a+ 63]
<>alive he was greatly relieved and immensely happy and
<>he blessed Ciraka1ri1. (Chapter 266, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>CIRAN5JI1VI1. The name of a crow, a character in the
<>‘Pan5catantra’. (See under Meghavarn2a).
<HI>CIRANTAKA. A son of Garud2a. (S4loka 1, Chapter
<>101, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>CI1RAVA1SAS I. A Ks2atriya King born as a rebirth of
<>an asura Krodhavas4a. (S4loka 61, Chapter 67, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>CI1RAVA1SAS II. A yaks2a. He stayed in the court of
<>Kubera worshipping him. (S4loka 10, Chapter 10,
<>Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>CIRA1YUS. An ancient King of the country Cira1yu.
<>Na1ga1rjuna was a minister of this King. Na1ga1rjuna knew
<>the secret of ‘Rasa1yanasiddhi’. Once Na1ga1rjuna pre-
<>pared a medicine for himself and the King which if
<>taken would keep them eternally young. They took
<>medicine accordingly.
<NI>After some days a child of the minister died. Grief-
<>stricken Na1ga1rjuna decided to prepare Amr2ta which
<>would eradicate death from this world. He had pre-
<>pared it but there remained one more medicine to be
<>added to this. The auspicious moment to add the same
<>was to come only after five days and Na1ga1rjuna waited.
<>The devas were frightened. If Amr2ta was made avail-
<>able on earth men would become Devas. Devas could
<>not bear this and so they sent the As4vini1kuma1ras to
<>the earth to persuade Na1ga1rjuna to desist from his work
<>of preparing Amr2ta. Further they informed him that his
<>dead child was living happily in heaven. He agreed to
<>stop his work.
<NI>After some time Cira1yus crowned his son Ji1vahara as the
<>heir-apparent. Overjoyed Ji1vahara ran to his mother
<>Dhanapara1 to give her the glad tidings. Dhanapara1
<>told her son thus: “My child, why should you be so
<>happy to think that you have become the heir-apparent.
<>Several sons of your father had already become yuvara1jas
<>and died before becoming King. Your father has taken
<>a medicine from Na1ga1rjuna and that will keep him
<>eternally young. None of his sons can aspire to be the
<>King. Your father is now eight hundred years old and
<>will live long. Many of you will become yuvara1jas but
<>not the King. I will therefore suggest a way to tide over
<>this difficulty. Everyday in the afternoon Na1ga1rjuna
<>would come outside the palace and enquire whether
<>anybody is in need of anything. At that time he would
<>give whatever was asked for. It is an opportunity when
<>you can ask for his head. When Na1ga1rjuna is dead your
<>father would either die of grief or go to the forests.
<>Then you can become the King.”
<NI>Ji1vahara was pleased to hear this suggestion and he went
<>that after-noon to the palace of Na1ga1rjuna and when
<>Na1ga1rjuna as usual came out with his query Ji1vahara
<>asked for his head. Most willingly Na1ga1rjuna offered
<>his head to be chopped off. But the effect of the medicine
<>made even the strongest cut by the sword ineffective.
<>Ji1vahara lost many swords without Na1ga1rjuna getting
<>even a small scratch on his neck. The hubbub brought
<>the King to the scene and he immediately asked Na1ga1r-
<>juna to withdraw his head but Na1ga1rjuna refused saying,
<>“Oh, King, in my ninetynine previous births I have
<>offered my head like this and please do not ask me to
<>desist from making this offer for the hundredth time”. [Page183-b+ 65]
<>So saying he embraced the King and taking a powder
<>from his body smeared it on the sword and asked Ji1va-
<>hara to strike again. This time very easily Ji1vahara
<>severed the head from the body of Na1ga1rjuna. The
<>King was greatly aggrieved and he renounced all and
<>went to the forest and led a pious life.
<NI>Cira1yus' son Ji1vahara became King. But Na1ga1rjuna's
<>sons killed him and his mother died of grief. (Taran3ga,
<>Ratnaprabha1 Lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>CI1RIN2I. A river. It was on the banks of this river that
<>Vaivasvata Manu clad in bark-skin and with knotted
<>hair did penance. (S4loka 6, Chapter 187, Vana Parva).
<HI>CITAL. (Termites). Cital has got its own place in the
<>pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata has the following story about
<>the origin of it.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u once looking at the face of Laks2mi1 laughed
<>without any apparent reason. Laks2mi1, thinking that
<>Vis2n2u was laughing at her and that he had an eye on
<>some other woman more beautiful than her lost her
<>temper and cursed Vis2n2u that his head would be severed
<>from his body.
<NI>No sooner was the curse pronounced than the asuras came
<>in batches fully armed and challenged Vis2n2u to war.
<>Single-handed the Lord fought the asuras with one bow.
<>The fight did not end though it continued for thousands
<>of years. Vis2n2u felt tired and decided to rest awhile.
<>He planted one end of the untied bow on the ground,
<>rested his chin on the other and sat in Padma1sana.
<>Being very tired the Lord remained asleep for a long
<>time in this posture.
<NI>About this time the devas made preparations to perform
<>a yajn5a. All the devas except Maha1vis2n2u attended that
<>yajn5a. Since he was the master of yajn5as performed for
<>purposes of the devas they could not begin it in his
<>absence. So, Brahma1 and others went in search
<>of Vis2n2u to Vaikun2t2ha. But he was not to be found there.
<>Then Brahma1 and others found out with their
<>eyes of knowledge where Vis2n2u was and they went to
<>the place where he was sleeping. They waited there
<>for a long time, yet Vis2n2u did not awake from sleep.
<>Then Brahma1 hit at a plan to awaken Vis2n2u. It was
<>to create citals (termites) to eat the end of the bow.
<>When they had eaten away the end of the bow
<>planted on the ground the cord binding the two ends
<>of it would break, the bow would straighten up and the
<>speedy movement of it would awaken Vis2n2u.
<NI>According to this plan Brahma1 created citals, but his
<>other plans were not acceptable to the citals. They
<>argued that the advantage of awakening the Lord from
<>sleep would go only to the devas, while its sin would
<>fall upon them.
<NI>They argued,
<Poem>Nidra1bhan3gah2 katha1chedo
<>Dampatyoh2 pri1tibhedanam /
<>S4is4uma1tr2vibhedas4ca
<>Brahmahatya1samam3 smr2tam //</Poem>
<F>*) To disturb one in sleep, to interrupt a story, to separate husband and wife as also mother and child from each other--these things
<>are tantamount to Brahmahatya1 (killing of the brahmin).</F>
<>Brahma1 conceded the justness of this argument and
<>agreed that, in future, a part of the result of yajn5as
<>shall go to citals. It was after this that havis (sa crificial
<>offering) which, in the course of being submitted to the
<>fire falls on the sides of the pit of fire became the share
<>of citals (termites). This promise of Brahma1 pleased the
<>the citals, and they did as was bidden by Brahma1 and [Page184-a+ 65]
<>the bow of Vis2n2u straightened up with a terrific sound.
<>The devas were terror-stricken, the whole universe
<>shook, the earth experienced a convulsion and the oceans
<>too were shaken. Moreover, the head of Vis2n2u was
<>severed from the body, rose high up in the sky and fell
<>into the sea. Brahma1, S4iva and others opened their eyes
<>only to find the body of Vis2n2u lying thus without the
<>head.
<NI>This loss of Vis2n2u's head proved to be useful in another
<>way. Now, Hayagri1va, after securing the boon from
<>Brahma1 that he would be killed only by one with horse's
<>head, was running rough-shod over the whole earth.
<>The devas cut off the head of a horse and attached it to
<>the trunk of Vis2n2u. Thus Vis2n2u came to life again, and
<>according to his orders the citals gnawed away the cord
<>of Hayagri1va's bow as a result of which he was killed.

<>drew in her imagination a figure which was exactly like
<>that of Aniruddha, the man of her dream. Us2a1 was

<HI>CITRAMUKHA. A sage. Though he was born a Vais4ya,

<NI>{%General information.%} When once Dharmaputra was

<>reigned by a King called Citrava1hana. Citra1n3gada1
<>was the daughter of Citrava1hana.
<NI>An ancestor of Citrava1hana greatly grieved by the lack
<>of a son, did great penance to propitiate S4iva and S4iva
<>blessed him and said that in future he and his successors [Page185-b+ 65]

<HI>CITRA1N3GADA1 III. Daughter of Vis4vakarma1. Once
<>while she was bathing in a pond along with her compa-
<>nions in the forest of Naimis4a Prince Suratha, son of
<>Sudeva, came that way. Seeing him Citra1n3gada1 told her
<>companions “This beautiful young man is in love. I
<>must give myself to him”. Though her companions
<>objected to her doing this, waving aside the objections
<>Citra1n3gada1 approached Suratha.
<NI>When Vis4vakarma1 knew about this he was extremely
<>angry and cursed her saying that she would never have
<>a marriage. Citra1n3gada1 fainted when she heard the
<>curse and her companions tried their best to wake her
<>up, but failed. They then took her to be dead and left
<>the place in search of firewood and other things to
<>conduct a funeral.
<NI>When Citra1n3gada1 woke up she looked around for her
<>companions and finding none including her lover, the
<>prince, she ran and threw herself into the river, Sarasvati1. [Page186-a+ 64]
<>That river pushed her down to river Gomati1 and that
<>river in turn washed her ashore a huge forest. There
<>she was met by the sage R2tadhvaja. Knowing her

<HI>CITRARATHA I. (AN3GA1RAPARN3A). A devagan-
<>dharva.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Citraratha was the gandharva son of
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife Muni. (S4loka 43, Chapter
<>65, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Citraratha and Arjuna.%} The greatest event in the
<>life of Citraratha alias An3ga1raparn2a was the defeat he
<>suffered at the hands of Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas after
<>their escape from the lac palace (La1ks2a1gr2ha) through
<>a tunnel arrived in a forest and there they killed the
<>demons Hid2im3ba and Baka. One night they were
<>walking along the shores of the river Gan3ga1 when they
<>heard a sound of somebody bathing in the river. Arjuna
<>who was walking ahead waving a country torch went
<>to see who was bathing at that time of the night. Arjuna
<>then saw Citraratha enjoying a bath with his wife
<>Kumbhi1nasi1. That period of the night was allotted to
<>the gandharvas, and human beings were not expected
<>to be out walking at that time. Citraratha felt it
<>impertinent that Arjuna a human being should be out
<>walking at night and peep into the privacy of the
<>gandharvas. The gandharva and Arjuna so entered into
<>a combat. Citraratha who was a great fighter was,
<>after a grim battle, subdued, bound hand and foot, and
<>brought before his brothers by Arjuna. Kumbhi1nasi1
<>followed her exhausted, powerless and spiritless husband
<>and pleaded to Dharmaputra to release him. Dharma-
<>putra advised Arjuna to do so and on getting his release
<>he taught Arjuna the famous Ca1ks2us2i1vidya1--the magic
<>art of seeing by one's own eyes anything and everything
<>in the three worlds: Heaven, Earth and the nether-
<>world. Manu was the author of this magic art and from
<>him Soma learnt it and from Soma Vis4va1vasu, from
<>Vis4va1vasu, Citraratha and from Citraratha, Arjuna.
<>Besides this Citraratha gave Arjuna many chariots
<>and horses.
<NI>In return Arjuna taught him the secret of the missile
<>Agnis4ira. Exchanging faith and affection thus Citraratha
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas became friends. He then narrated to

<>and tales about the sage Para1s4ara, Kalma1s2apa1da,
<>Adr2s4yanti1, Bha1rgavas, Kr2tavi1rya and Aurva. Citra-
<>ratha advised the Pa1n2d2avas to have a priest for the
<>sacrificial rites and it was thus that they engaged
<>Dhaumya as their family priest.
<NI>Since Arjuna had destroyed all the chariots belonging to
<>Citraratha, the latter got a name ‘Bhagnaratha’ (devoid
<>of chariots). Citraratha admitted that Arjuna could [Page186-b+ 65]
<>conquer him because of his vow of celibacy. (Chapters
<>165 to 183, A1di Parva, M.B.).

<>there is the following story about him.
<NI>Citraratha was also one among those assembled for the
<>svayam3vara of Hema1, daughter of Kus4a. He sent an
<>anaesthetic missile to the assemblage and made them
<>all fall down senseless. He then took Hema1 out from the
<>marriage hall. But on reaching outside he felt he had
<>done a very unjust thing and so withdrew the missile
<>and stood outside ready to fight. A fight ensued in
<>which Citraratha defeated all. But Lava alone continued
<>to fight with him. Vi1raba1hu, father of Citraratha, who
<>was closely watching the fight came to the help of Citra-
<>ratha and engaging Lava in a fight struck him down.
<>Kus4a seeing this attacked Vi1raba1hu and bound him
<>hand and foot. At that time S4ri1 Ra1ma came to the scene

<HI>CITRASENA I. A gandharva. There is reference to
<>this gandharva in many places in the pura1n2as. He had
<>two wives Sandhya1vali1 and Ratna1vali1.
<NI>1) {%How Arjuna saved him.%} Once when Citrasena with
<>his wives was travelling in the aerial car the spittings of
<>Citrasena fell upon the sage Ga1lava who was doing his
<>sandhya1 rites then. The sage complained about the
<>incident to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a who promised to bring to him the
<>head of Citrasena before sun-set. Sage Na1rada informed
<>Citrasena of this vow of Kr2s2n2a. The gandharva was
<>taken aback and did not know what to do. But Sandhya1-
<>vali1 and Ratna1vali1 went and sought the help of Subhadra1.
<>They made a fire pit in front of her house and decided
<>to end their lives along with Citrasena by jumping into
<>the fire. While Citrasena was circling the fire-pit be-
<>fore jumping into it his wives wept loudly and hearing
<>the noise Subhadra1 came out and saw what was happen-
<>ing. They then took from Subhadra1 a boon to the effect
<>that they should be allowed to live with their husband.
<>It was only after granting them the boon that Subhadra1
<>understood the whole situation. Subhadra1 was in a
<>fix but Arjuna assured her that Citrasena would be
<>protected at any cost. Arjuna very cleverly shielded all
<>the arrows sent against the gandharva by Kr2s2n2a and
<>gradually the fight came to be one between Arjuna and
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Subhadra1 came between them and it was
<>found difficult to continue the fight. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a advised
<>Citrasena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava.
<>Citrasena obeyed and the issue settled without harm to
<>both the parties.
<NI>2) {%Arjuna defeats Citrasena.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were
<>in exile, Duryodhana knew through a spy that they
<>were camping in the Dvaitavana forest. Prompted by
<>Karn2a Duryodhana programmed to go to Dvaitavana
<>with his retinue to enjoy the sight of the suffering Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas. So they started to the forests under a pretext of an
<>annual stock-taking of the cows. They reached Dvaita-
<>vana with a huge army. There they split into parties
<>and roamed about making merry by themselves. Soon
<>one of the parties reached a pond near the hermitage of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. They saw a few gandharvas making
<>merry in the pond. With the usual haughtiness they
<>commanded the gandharvas to leave the pond and make
<>room for Duryodhana to come and bathe. The gandhar-
<>vas did not pay heed to their words and on being inform-
<>ed of this Duryodhana went to fight with the gandhar-
<>vas. It was Citrasena who led the gandharvas and by
<>his incessant shower of piercing arrows split the Kaurava
<>forces and made them flee for life. Duryodhana was
<>isolated from his army, was bound hand and foot and
<>taken a prisoner. In their sheer helplessness they approa-
<>ched Dharmaputra in his hermitage and acquainted
<>him with the pitiable plight of Duryodhana. Dharma-
<>putra asked Arjuna to go to the help of the Kauravas.
<>Arjuna faced Citrasena in a grim combat. Citrasena
<>then appeared in his real form and Arjuna knew that
<>he was fighting a friend. Then at the request of Arjuna
<>Citraratha released Duryodhana. (Chapters 239 to
<>243, Vana Parva).
<NI>3) {%Other details.%} (1) This gandharva occupied a seat
<>in the court of Yudhis2t2hira along with twentyseven other [Page187-b+ 65]

<NI>(4) At the invitation of Indra Arjuna went to devaloka
<>and Citrasena taught him dance and music. It was
<>during this visit that Arjuna threw a cold blanket on the
<>amorous approaches of Urvas4i1 and was consequently
<>cursed by her to be an eunuch. It was through Citrasena

<>give relief from the curse. (Chapters 45 and 46, Vana

<>t2haloka (The abode of Maha1vis2n2u).
<NI>Once Cola went to Vaikun2t2ha to worship Maha1vis2n2u.
<>As he was worshipping him with pearls and flowers
<>of gold a brahmin subject of his came there to worship
<>him with water and Tulasi1 leaves. The simple offer-
<>ing of Tulasi1 leaves and flowers by this brahmar2s2i, Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa, eclipsed the expensive one by the King and the
<>latter was greatly offended and he rebuked the Brahmin
<>saying that he was a poor man who did not know what
<>devotion to Vis2n2u was. But Vis2n2uda1sa did not take
<>the taunt unchallenged. He asked the king to wait
<>and see who would merge with the glowing entity of
<>the Lord earlier.
<NI>The King on returning to his palace started a Vais2n2ava-
<>sattra. (An almonry dedicated to Maha1vis2n2u). This
<>almshouse was as comfortable and luxurious as the
<>one once started by Brahma1 in the temple of Gaya.
<>Vis2n2uda1sa on the other hand spent his life in a Vis2n2u
<>temple leading a celibate life and observing rites pleas-
<>ing to Vis2n2u.
<NI>One day after finishing his daily morning rites Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa cooked his food as usual and kept it in its place
<>to be taken later. But on returning to it after some
<>time he found his food eaten by someone else. He
<>went without food that day and it happened the next
<>day also. It continued to happen thus for a week and
<>all these days Vis2n2uda1sa went fasting. Vis2n2uda1sa
<>then decided to watch and see who the thief was.
<>On keeping a vigil he found a Can2d2a1la (a harijan of
<>the lowest Cadre) timidly coming and grabbing at
<>the food with gluttonous greed to appease his hunger.
<>Seeing the famished skeletonous body of the thief Vis2n2u-
<>da1sa felt compassion rather than resentment and calling
<>him back to take the food went after him crying “Hi,
<>come here and take this ghee also with you. That food
<>has no fat in it.” But the Gan2d2a1la frightened at the
<>sight of the owner of the food ran away as fast as his
<>legs could carry him, Vis2n2uda1sa following him. But
<>soon the Can2d2a1la fell fainting on the road exhausted and
<>tired. Vis2n2uda1sa reaching his side started fanning him
<>with his cloth. Very soon the Can2d2a1la changed
<>himself into Maha1vis2n2u adorned with S4am3kha, Cakra
<>and Gada1 and Vis2n2u embracing his devotee took him
<>to Vaikun2t2ha.
<NI>Hearing this Cola called Mudgala the priest of the
<>Vais2n2avasattra, to his side and lamented “I started
<>this sattra to spite Vis2n2uda1sa and now he has gone to [Page189-a+ 65]
<>Vaikun2t2ha. It was due to his true devotion to God
<>that he has attained salvation. What we have done
<>is of no use.” So saying he crowned his nephew as
<>King. Even while young he had become an ascetic and as
<>such had no sons. From that time the crowning of
<>the nephew as King became a precedent in Cola.
<>Renouncing the kingdom Cola went to the sacrificial
<>hall and circling the sacrificial fire stood before it and
<>addressing Mukunda said “Oh Vis2n2u, grant me un-
<>wavering devotion to you in thought, speech and deed.”
<>Repeating this three times the king jumped into the
<>fire. At this Mudgala, the priest, burst into anger and
<>tore off the lock of hair on his head. So even today
<>the decendants of Mudgala do not have hair-locks.
<>Vis2n2u who is always affectionate to his devotees graci-
<>ously appeared from the sacrificial fire and embraced
<>the King. The King was then taken to Vaikun2t2ha.

<HI>CU1T2U. (Dice). It is an imaginative paura1n2ic assump-
<>tion that there is a satanic force latent in dice, hunting,
<>wine and women. There is a story to support the pre-

<>once turned the As4vini1devas out of his court labelling
<>them as outcastes and banned wine to them. Discon-
<>tented at this the As4vini1devas approached Cyavana and
<>the latter performing a ya1ga invited the As4vini1devas and
<>gave them the ya1ga wine, ‘Soma’. Infuriated at this
<>Indra raised his celebrated Vajra1yudha (Weapon of
<>thunder) to kill Cyavana. But the sage by his yogic
<>powers paralysed the hands of Indra and instantly from
<>the sacrificial fire there arose Mada a genie to kill Indra.
<>Frightened by this sight Indra fell at the feet of Cyavana
<>and craved for pardon. The sage then tore the genie into
<>four pieces and threw one each into dice, hunting, wine
<>and women. That is why all the four are as alluring as
<>destructive. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>CYAVANA. A celebrated sage of the Bha1rgava dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Brahma1--
<>Bhr2gu--Cyavana.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Bhr2gu is the son of Brahma1 born of Agni at the
<>Brahmayajn5a conducted by Varun2a. The beautiful and
<>virtuous lady Puloma1 was the wife of Bhr2gu. Even be-
<>fore Bhr2gu married her she was being loved by the demon
<>Puloma1 and her marriage with Bhr2gu embittered him
<>and he waited for an opportunity to kidnap Puloma1.
<NI>One day when Bhr2gu went to the river for his bath
<>Puloma1 entered the a1s4rama and there he found his love
<>Puloma1 being watched over by Agni. Puloma1 compelled
<>Agni to tell him the truth whether Bhr2gu had married
<>Puloma1 according to the rites enjoined by the scriptures.
<>Agni confessed that it was not so and then Puloma1
<>taking the shape of a hog carried away Puloma1 who was
<>then in a stage of advanced pregnancy. On the way the
<>wife of the sage delivered and the babe dropped to the
<>ground. Because the babe was born with a fall (Cyavana)
<>from the womb the boy was named Cyavana. The
<>radiance of the boy burnt the demon into ashes. Puloma1
<>weeping profusely with tears rolling down her cheeks
<>returned to the a1s4rama. Her tears ran into a river and the
<>river got the name Vadhu1sara1 Bhr2gu on knowing how all
<>happened cursed Agni saying that Agni would thereafter
<>be an all-round eater. (eating anything and everything).
<>(Chapters 5 and 6, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Penance and marriage.%} Even when he was very
<>young Cyavana commenced practising austerities.
<>He went to the forests and sat in meditation without food
<>or sleep, oblivious to what happened outside. Years went
<>by and Cyavana did not stir from his place. Gradually
<>earth began to cover him and soon he was completely
<>enveloped by earth. Creepers grew on it and birds made
<>rests; Cyavana did not know anything about it. [Page190-a+ 65]
<>One day S4arya1ti with his wives and children came to
<>that forest for a picnic. Sukanya1, daughter of King
<>S4arya1ti, along with her companions separated from the
<>King and roamed about in the forest making merry.
<>They soon came to the place where Cyavana sat doing
<>penance. There was an unusual radiance around the
<>heap of earth they saw there and Sukanya1 out of curiosity
<>started striking down the earth. Then from inside came
<>Cyavana's voice advising her not to crumble down the
<>earth as she was doing. Sukanya1 ignored the advice and
<>searched for the source of the voice. She then saw two
<>points of glow and taking a thorn gave two pricks at
<>those points and left the place with her companions.
<NI>Those glow-points were the eyes of Cyavana and Cya-
<>vana felt insufferable pain when his eyes were thus pierced
<>through. But he neither became angry nor cursed the
<>girl who did this havoc. Cyavana went on with his
<>penance. But soon the country of S4arya1ti began to expe-
<>rience the bad effects of this evil-deed. People one by one
<>in the beginning and then the whole lot were disabled
<>from passing either urine or faeces. From men and
<>women the disease spread to the animals also. The country
<>was in a chaos and the subjects flocked to the palace to
<>complain to the King. S4arya1ti knew that somebody must
<>have in a some way tormented Cyavana and enquired
<>of each and everyone of his subjects. Whether anybody
<>had knowingly or unknowingly given pain to Cyavana.
<>Nobody had done so and the King was worried. Then
<>Sukanya1 ran to her father and confessed what she had
<>done. The King ran immediately to the place where
<>Cyavana was doing penance and striking down the earth
<>prostrated before the sage who was sitting there sad and
<>miserable. The King apologised to Cyavana and reques-
<>ted him to pardon his daughter.
<NI>Cyavana then told the King that it was enough if he
<>gave his daughter in marriage to him in expiation of the
<>harm done. The King was shocked to hear this for
<>Cyavana was not only ugly but now blind also. The
<>King returned to the palace sad and worried and there
<>was gloom over the whole palace. But Sukanya1 approa-
<>ched her father and agreed to be the wife of Cyavana.
<>The problem was solved and the King with great reluc-
<>tance took his daughter to the forests and gave her in
<>marriage to Cyavana.
<NI>4) {%Cyavana attains eternal youth.%} It was the time when
<>Indra had banned Somapa1na (drinking of the ya1ga wine)
<>to the As4vini1devas. Discontented at this they roamed
<>about in the forests and soon came to the neighbourhood
<>of the a1s4rama of Cyavana.
<NI>Sukanya1 after becoming the wife of Cyavana did all she
<>could to make her husband comfortable and happy.
<>She would collect very sweet and tasty fruit from the
<>forests and give him. She would bathe him in hot water.
<>After arranging all the materials needed for the morning
<>rites like yava, sesame, darbha and water, she would
<>take her husband to the place of the pu1ja1 leading him
<>by hand. When the morning pu1ja1 was over she would
<>seat him in a suitable place and give him rice and fruits.
<>After the meals she would give him pan to chew. Only
<>after doing all these would she go to do her daily rites
<>and that too only after obtaining her husband's permis-
<>sion. She would finish her routine in no time to come
<>back to her husband to see whether he was in need of
<>anything. Then she would make arrangements for the
<>evening pu1ja1 and after the pu1ja1 was over she would give [Page190-b+ 65]
<>him his dinner. She would eat only what was left by
<>her husband. At night she would spread a soft bedding
<>and lull him to sleep. Then she would take a nap lying
<>at the foot of her husband. During summer she would
<>fan him and during winter she would make fire to give
<>him heat. Early morning she would take him to a dis-
<>tant place for his excretion and after washing him would
<>seat him in a suitable place for cleaning his teeth and
<>face. Then the routine would start with great devotion
<>again.
<NI>One day Sukanya1 was returning from the river after her
<>bath and on the way she came across the As4vini1devas.
<>They were astounded to see such a beautiful damsel in
<>the forest and they accosted her and requested her to
<>select one of them as her husband. Knowing her identity
<>they advised her to forsake her old and blind husband and
<>come and live with one of them. She flew into a fury
<>when she heard her husband spoken of so slightingly
<>and by logical argument convinced them the error of
<>their request. Then they told her thus: “You are aware
<>we are the physicians of the devas. We can give back
<>eyesight to your husband and make him as beautiful
<>as one of us. We will then appear before you as three
<>lovely young men identical in appearance and then you
<>must select one among the three as your husband.”
<NI>Sukanya1 was immensely pleased as well as surprised to
<>hear the offer and was eager to see her husband young
<>and beautiful. But the last condition frightened her.
<>Anyhow she promised to give a reply after consulting her
<>husband and ran to the a1s4rama to tell her husband the
<>news. Cyavana advised her to accept the offer of the
<>As4vini1devas and Sukanya1 ran back to the As4vini1devas
<>and brought them to her husband accepting their terms.
<>The As4vini1devas took the aged and blind Cyavana along
<>with them to the river nearby and the three plunged into
<>the river. When they rose up after a dip the three emer-
<>ged as young, lovely and charming triplets difficult to be
<>distinguished from one another. When Sukanya1 stood
<>before the three to select her real husband she prayed to
<>her goddess and the Devi1 gave her the power to identify
<>Cyavana and so she correctly chose him from the three.
<>(Saptama Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>5) {%Cyavana defeated Indra.%} Immensely pleased at re-
<>gaining his eyesight and youth Cyavana asked the As4vini1-
<>devas what they wanted. The As4vini1devas replied that
<>Indra had banned wine to them and they would like to
<>have the ban lifted. Cyavana Mahars2i immediately
<>commenced a Somaya1ga to which were invited all the
<>devas and the As4vini1devas also. When Indra saw the
<>As4vini1devas standing to partake of the Soma wine he was
<>furious and objected to the wine being given to them.
<>Cyavana dissented and a fight ensued between Indra and
<>Cyavana. Indra raised his weapon ‘Vajra1yudha’ to
<>strike at Cyavana and then Cyavana made all his limbs
<>go stiff. He then raised from the sacrificial fire a fiendish
<>demon called Mada to kill the devas. All those present
<>were frightened by this demon and they ran away. But
<>Indra could not run for his limbs were stiff. Standing
<>there he prayed to his preceptor Br2haspati for help and
<>Br2haspati advised Indra to surrender to Cyavana. Indra
<>bowed his head before Cyavana and prayed to be ex-
<>cused. Cyavana was pleased and withdrawing the demon
<>tore him into four pieces and threw one each into Dice,
<>Hunting, Wine and Women. The devas and As4vini1devas
<>then went back to heaven. (Saptama Skandha, Devi1 [Page191-a+ 64]
<>Bha1gavata. R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 17, Su1kta
<>116; Chapter 123, Vana Parva).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(1) Paras4ura1ma once came and stayed at the a1s4rama of
<>Cyavana. At that time Bhr2gu and Cyavana were in the
<>a1s4rama. They blessed him and advised him to go to
<>Kaila1sa and do penance there to propitiate S4iva. It was
<>thus that Paras4ura1ma happened to go to Kaila1sa to do
<>penance there. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 62).
<NI>(2) Cyavana got a son named Pramati. This Pramati
<>was the father of Ruru and the grandfather of S4unaka.
<>(Chapter 5, A1di Parva).
<NI>(3) Cyavana married A1rus2i daughter of Manu. Aurva
<>was the son born to A1rus2i from her thigh. In descending
<>order from Aurva were born R2ci1ka--Jamadagni--
<>Paras4ura1ma. (Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<NI>(4) A1sti1ka learnt Sa1n3ga Vedas from the a1s4rama
<>of Cyavana. (Chapter 48, A1di Parva).
<NI>(5) Cyavana was the guru of Bhi1s2ma. (S4loka 11,
<>Chapter 37, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(6) King Yuvana1s4va once went to the a1s4rama of Cyavana
<>greatly worried over the lack of a descendant. Cyavana
<>prepared some sacred water made potent with the recital
<>of mantras to induce gestation and kept it there. Acci-
<>dentally the King drank that water and got pregnant.
<>The pregnancy developed without miscarriage and in due
<>time the King gave birth to a child, the left side of his
<>stomach bursting forth to push out the child. It was this
<>child who became Ma1ndha1ta1. (Chapter 126, Vana
<>Parva).
<NI>(7) Cyavana was a brilliant member of the court of
<>Brahma1. (S4loka 11, Chapter 22, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(8) Cyavana went to Pa1ta1la (nether-world). (See under
<>Kekaralohita).
<NI>(9) Once the august Vedas4arma1 of Kaus4i1kagotra went
<>to the a1s4rama of Cyavana lost in thought. Cyavana recei-
<>ved him with due respect and enquired about the reason
<>for his sorrow. Vedas4arma1 then told him that the lack of a
<>son worried him much. Cyavana then blessed him and
<>assured him of a child soon. (Chapter 14, Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>(10) Cyavana had a daughter named Sumanas and she
<>was married to a sage called Somas4arma1. (Chapter 14,
<>Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>CYAVANA1S4RAMA. A sacred place. Am3ba1, daughter
<>of Ka1s4ira1ja, used to bathe in a pond nearby. (S4loka 26,
<>Chapter 186, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>CYAVANASAROVARAM. A sacred place. It is believ-
<>ed that this is the best place for worshipping Pitr2s
<>(spirits of the dead). (S4loka 11, Chapter 125, Vana
<>Parva).
<H>D
<HI>D. ({#qa#}) This letter means (1) Rudra and (2) tremor
<>or fear (tra1sa).
<HI>DA. This syllable means ruin. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>348).
<HI>DABHI1TI. A hermit who is praised much in the R2g-
<>veda. It is mentioned in R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka
<>16, Su1kta 112, that the As4vini1devas had saved Turvi1ti,
<>Dabhi1ti, Dhvasanti and Purus2anti, the sons of Indra,
<>from a danger.
<HI>DADHI1CA. (DADHI1CI).
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} A famous hermit. Mention is made in
<>Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 83, that
<>this hermit was the son of the great hermit Bhr2gu, and [Page191-b+ 64]
<>that he was made of the essences of the world, with a
<>huge body.
<NI>2) {%The birth of the hermit Sa1rasvata.%} Dadhi1ca erected his
<>hermitage on the bank of the river Sarasvati1 and began
<>to do penance. The power of penance increased daily.
<>Seeing this Indra was flurried. So he sent the celestial
<>maid Alam3bus2a1 to break the penance of Dadhi1ca some-
<>how or other. Alam3bus2a1 came to the hermitage of
<>Dadhi1ca and began to dance and sing. When the hermit
<>saw her he grew lustful and seminal discharge occurred
<>to him. The semen fell in the river Sarasvati1, who be-
<>came pregnant and in due course gave birth to a child.
<>She took the child to the hermit Dadhi1ca and told him
<>the story of the child. The hermit was much pleased.
<>He took the child and embraced it and blessed the river
<>Sarasvati1 thus:--
<NI>“Brahma1, the gods and the celestial maids will be pleased
<>if your water is offered as oblation.”
<NI>Dadhi1ci then said that the child should be named Sa1ras-
<>vata. He also added that when there was a drought conti-
<>nuously for twelve years, Sa1rasvata would have the
<>power to bring rain. Then Sarasvati1 took the child to
<>her abode and brought it up.
<NI>3) {%How he destroyed the asuras with the head of a horse.%} Once
<>Dadhi1ci went to the world of the devas (gods).
<>From there he looked down and saw the earth filled with
<>the asuras. Indra went to destroy them. But he could
<>not. So he made a search for anything left behind by
<>Dadhi1ca. He understood that Dadhi1ca had with him
<>the head of a horse. It was found in a lake in the country
<>of S4aran2ya. With the bones taken from that head Indra
<>and Dadhi1ca destroyed a large number of asuras.
<>(R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka 13, Su1kta 84).
<NI>4) {%The weapon%} (Vajra) of Indra was made from a bone.
<>A story occurs in the Maha1bha1rata, which says that the
<>Diamond-weapon of Indra was made of a bone of
<>Dadhi1ci. The asuras went to fight with Indra under the
<>leadership of Vr2ttra1sura. Indra tried his utmost to kill
<>Vr2ttra1sura, but he could not. At last Indra approached
<>Brahma1, who told Indra that if a bone of the hermit,
<>called Dadhi1ca was obtained it could effectively be used
<>against Vr2tra. Accordingly Indra went with Nara
<>and Na1ra1yan2a to the banks of the river Sarasvati1 and
<>entered the hermitage and bowed before the shining
<>hermit Dadhi1ca and informed him of their errand. The
<>hermit replied that he had no objection in giving his
<>bone to save the gods. Saying thus the hermit discarded
<>his life. Indra took the bone of Dadhi1ci and made his
<>weapon of Diamond (Vajra) with which he killed Vr2tra
<>and his followers. (Maha1bha1rata, Chapter 100).
<NI>5) {%Other information%}
<NI>(1) At the sacrifice of Daks2a, Dadhi1ci got angry because
<>S4iva was not given his dues of the sacrifice. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 284).
<NI>(2) Once Dadhi1ci talked to a Bra1hmin called Karun2a
<>about the importance of the ashes dedicated to S4iva.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 101).
<NI>(3) See Dhanan5jaya V to know how this hermit gave
<>absolution from curse to a fly.
<HI>DADHI1CA(M). A holy place in Kuruks2etra. An3giras
<>the son of Sarasvati1 was born in this place. From that
<>day onwards this place became a holy place. It is men-
<>tioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 83,
<>Stanza 186 that he who bathes in this holy place will [Page192-a+ 66]
<>obtain the fruits of performing the sacrifice As4vamedha,
<>and enter the world of Sarasvati1.
<HI>DADHIMAN2D2ODAKA. An ocean. This ocean is near the
<>ocean Ghr2toda samudra (Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 12, Stanza 2).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA I. A famous serpent, born to Kas4yapa
<>praja1pati by his wife Kadru1. (Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 35, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIMUKHA II. A famous monkey. This old mon-
<>key was the general of a huge monkey-army. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<>283, Stanza 7 that this general approached S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>once, with his army.
<HI>DADHIVA1HANA. An ancient king of Bha1rata. The
<>hermit Gautama saved the son of this King from the
<>attack of Paras4ura1ma (Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 49, Stanza 8).
<HI>DADHIVAKTRA. A monkey who helped S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>It is seen in Adhya1tma Ra1ma1yan2a, Sundara Ka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 5, as follows:--
<NI>“Dadhimukhah2 Kruddhasugri1vasya ma1tulah2”. From
<>this it is understood that Dadhimukha or Dadhiva-
<>ktra was the uncle of Sugri1va. (For further infor-
<>mation see Madhuvana).
<HI>DADHYAN3.
<F>1) The stories regarding the two hermits Dadhici and Dadhyan3 in the Pura1n2as are not very clear. In Maha1 bha1rata Dadhi1ca is men-
<>tioned as the son of Bhr2gu, and in R2gveda it occurs that Dadhi1ca was the son of Hermit Atharva who was the son of Vasis2t2ha.
<>Moreover the story of Dadhyan3 teaching the As4vini1devas the ‘Madhuvidya1’ is connected with Dadhici in some other pura1nas
<>Some statements in the R2gveda make it difficult to assume that both Dadhyan3 and Dadhi1ci are one and the same person. So relving
<>on the majority of statements in the various pura1n2as this book has accepted the fact that these hermits are separate persons and that
<>Dadhi1ci was the son of Bhr2gu whereas the hermit who taught Madhuvidya1 to the As4vini1devas was Dadhyan3.</F> A hermit. Once Indra taught this
<>hermit Madhuvidya1 (the art of mead) Indra told the
<>hermit that his head would be cut off if he taught any-
<>body this art. The As4vini1devas approached Dadhyan3
<>to learn this art. Fearing Indra the hermit refused to
<>teach them the art. As4vini1devas cut off his head and
<>buried it in a place. Then they cut off the head of a
<>horse and fixed it on the neck of Dadhyan3. Having
<>the head of the horse he taught the art to the As4vini1-
<>devas. When Dadhyan3 had finished teaching, they
<>took away the head of the horse and fixed his own
<>head in place. (R2gveda, Man2d2ala 1, Anuva1ka, 17,
<>Su1kta 166).
<HI>DAHA I. One of the eleven Rudras. He was the grand-
<>son of Brahma1 and the son of Stha1n2u. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 3).
<HI>DAHA II. An attendant given to Subrahman2ya by
<>Am3s4a, a god. (Maha1bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>45, Stanza 34).
<HI>DAHADAHA1. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 20).
<HI>DAHATI. A warrior given to Subrahman2ya by god
<>Am3s4a. Mention is made about this warrior in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 34.
<HI>DAIVA I. Almighty God. (See I1s4vara).
<HI>DAIVA II. A kind of marriage. The form of marriage
<>by which one gives his daughter to a priest. (See
<>Viva1ha).
<HI>DAIVA1LI1KA. A country. Mention is made in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 18, that
<>the King and the people of Daiva1li1ka were present
<>on the occasion of the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya (imperial
<>consecration) of Yudhis2t2hira.
<HI>DAIVASAM3PATTI. The virtues of those who are
<>born of a noble family.
<NI>“He Bharata ! Security, knowledge of tattvas the desire [Page192-b+ 60]
<>to attain harmony with the Supreme Being by the know-
<>ledge of Brahman, alms-giving, self restraint, perform-
<>ing sacrifice, self-study, penance, sincerity, truth, libe-
<>rality, continence, kindness, mildness, modesty, resolu-
<>tion, cleanliness, forgiveness, brightness, abstaining
<>from committing murder and getting angry, having
<>no malignity, covetousness, fickleness and pride and
<>not injuring others are the Daivasam3patti or good
<>qualities of a noble man.” (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 40).
<HI>DAITYADI1PA. One of the sons of Garud2a. Mention
<>is made about Daityadi1pa in Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 101, Stanza 11.
<HI>DAITYASENA1. Sister of Devasena1, the wife of Subrah-
<>man2ya. Kes4i, an asura, married her. (For detailed
<>story, see Devasena1).
<HI>D2A1KINI. A class of women supposed to be proficient
<>in magic and the performance of feats with the help
<>of mantras. (See Ks2uraka).
<HI>DAKS2A.
<NI>1) {%Two Daks2as.%} In most of the Pura1n2as references
<>about two Daks2as occur. In some pura1n2as both are
<>referred to as one and the same person, whereas in
<>some others both are considered as separate persons,
<>so much so the stories concerning both are interlocked
<>and entangled very often. The fact is that there was
<>only one Daks2a, whose life was of two stages. The first
<>Daks2a was killed at the sacrifice of Daks2a, at which point,
<>ends the first stage, or the first Daks2a. The second stage
<>was the rebirth of the same Daks2a. A short biography
<>of Daks2a including both stages is given below:--
<NI>Brahma1 created by his mind, the seven great hermits,
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha and
<>Kratu. So these seven hermits are called the Ma1nasa-
<>putras (sons born from mind) of Brahma1. After this,
<>from the anger of Brahma1, Rudra was born, and from
<>his lap Na1rada, from his right thumb Daks2a, from
<>his mind the Sanakas and from his left thumb a daughter
<>named Vi1ran2i1 were born.
<Poem>Vi1ran2i1 na1ma tasya1 stu
<>asikni1tya1pi sattama1</Poem>
<NI>From this passage which occurs in Ka1lika1 Pura1n2a it
<>may be assumed that ‘Asikni1’ was another name of
<>Vi1ran2i1. Daks2a did penance in the mountain of Vindhya
<>for a long time. It is mentioned in Bha1gavata, Skandha
<>8, that Maha1vis2n2u appeared before Daks2a and gave
<>him Asikni1 as his wife.
<NI>Several sons were born to Daks2a by his wife Asikni1.
<>The last one was a daughter named Sati1 who became
<>the wife of S4iva. At this time Daks2a performed a sacrifice.
<>As he was not invited to that sacrifice, S4iva sent
<>Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1 and killed Daks2a. Though
<>the devas put the head of a goat in place of the lost
<>head and brought Daks2a to life again, no reference
<>is made about the life of Daks2a after the sacrifice. Thus
<>the first stage of the life of Daks2a ends. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 7).
<NI>After this, once the Pracetases (the ten sons of Barhis)
<>were engaged in penance and the earth was not pro-
<>perly cultivated in consequence of which big trees [Page193-a+ 65]
<>grew up and the whole of the earth was changed into
<>a big forest. The sky was covered with tree tops. It
<>was difficult even for the wind to pass through them
<>and thus the forest thrived for ten thousand years. The
<>pracetases got out of the sea after penance and entered
<>the shore. When they saw the big forest they got angry
<>and the ten of them discharged fire and wind from
<>their faces. The wind up-rooted the trees and the fire
<>dried them. Thus almost the whole of the trees were
<>consumed. Then Candra, the King of the medicinal
<>herbs came there and told the Pracetases “Oh, Kings,
<>hold your anger. I will make the trees conclude a
<>treaty with you. The beautiful Ma1ris2a1 who was born
<>to the trees is my foster-daughter. I give her to you
<>as your wife. From half the portion of your minds
<>and half the portion of my mind the great and wise
<>praja1pati Daks2a is going to take birth in her womb”.
<NI>The Pracetases controlled their anger and accepted
<>Ma1ris2a1 as their wife, at the words of Somadeva (Candra)
<>and as the son of the ten pracetases the Praja1pati Daks2a
<>was born. With this the second stage of the life of Daks2a
<>begins. The important occurrences in the two stages
<>of the life of Daks2a are given below in their order.
<NI>2) {%Daks2a's creation of the prajas or subjects.%} Once Brahma1
<>called Daks2a and ordered him to create praja1s or sub-
<>jects. Accordingly Daks2a created the gods, the hermits,
<>the Gandharvas (Demi-gods), the Asuras, the serpents
<>etc. Seeing that the subjects he created were not pro-
<>liferating as required he thought of creating subjects
<>by coition of male and female; and he begot by his
<>wife Asikni1 five thousand sons, and they were called
<>Haryas4vas. They in their turn were about to create
<>subjects when Na1rada appeared before them and said
<>“Oh, Haryas4vas, you are mere children and ignorant
<>of the secrets of this world. How do you intend to
<>create subjects? You fools, since you have the power
<>to go up and down and lengthwise and breadthwise,
<>why don't you try to find out the extremities of the
<>earth?” Hearing the words of Na1rada, they all ran
<>in different directions and have not returned since.
<>Thus Daks2a lost the Haryas4vas. Daks2a again begot
<>thousand sons by Asikni1 and they were called S4abala1s4vas.
<>Seeing that they also were about to create subjects
<>Na1rada scattered them also, by some tricks. The
<>S4abala1s4vas who had gone to see the end of the earth
<>have not yet returned.
<NI>Daks2a got angry with Na1rada and cursed him thus:
<>“You also, like my children shall wander from place
<>to place all over the earth”. From that dry onwards
<>Na1rada became a wanderer, without a fixed dwelling
<>place. The wise Praja1pati Daks2a again begot sixty
<>damsels by Asikni1. Ten of the girls were given to Dharma-
<>deva, thirteen of them to Kas4yapa, twentyseven of
<>them to Soma, and four of them to Aris2t2anemi. Of

<NI>The names of the wives given to An3giras, Aris2t2anemi,
<>Ba1huputra and Kr2s4a1s4va are not mentioned.
<NI>Besides these damsels, twentyfour daughters were born
<>to Daks2a of his wife Prasu1ti who was the sister of Utta1na-
<>pa1da. Dharmadeva married thirteen of them also, named
<>S4raddha1, Laks2mi1, Dhr2ti, Tus2t2i, Medha1, Pus2t2i, Kriya1,

<>to Vasis2t2ha, Sva1ha1 to Agnideva and Svadha1 to the
<>Manes. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 15).
<NI>3) {%Sacrifice of Daks2a.%} Once Daks2a performed a sacri-
<>fice called Br2haspatisavana. To this sacrifice he did not
<>invite his daughter Sati1 or her husband S4iva. Daks2a
<>did not invite them because of three reasons according
<>to the Pura1n2as.
<NI>(1) Once Durva1sas, the son of Atri, went to Jambu1nada
<>and meditated with the mantra or spell of ‘Ma1ya1bi1ja’
<>and worshipped Jagadambika1 (mother of the
<>world) the goddess there. The goddess was much plea-
<>sed and gave him as a token of her pleasure the garland
<>of flowers she wore from which nectar was oozing.
<>Durva1sas wore it on his head and went to the palace of
<>Daks2a, the Praja1pati. When he saw such a wonderful
<>garland which was not of this world, he wanted to have
<>it and Durva1sas instantly gave it to Daks2a. He placed it in
<>a prominent place in his bedroom and enjoying the
<>wonderful fragrance of it he conjugated with his wife,
<>and polluted that pure garland by his lust. S4iva and his
<>wife came to know of this and they scolded Daks2a, who
<>kept this bitterness in his heart and when the sacrifice
<>was performed, he decided not to invite them. (Devi1
<>Bha1gavata, Skandha 7).
<NI>(2) S4iva was considered as a polluted man by Daks2a
<>as he had always been carrying with him the skull of
<>Brahma1 and so he thought it wrong on his part to admit
<>his daughter and son-in-law to the sacrificial hall. The
<>story of how S4iva came to have the skull, is given below.
<NI>In days of old when the whole world was under the
<>single ocean (of the great flood) the sun, the moon, the
<>fire, air everything was destroyed and darkness pre-
<>vailed. All the vegetations were destroyed. All the
<>emotions and non-emotions disappeared. The supreme
<>Lord was sleeping for so many thousands of nights
<>together. At the end of the night he assumed the attri-
<>bute of ‘Rajogun2a’ (activity) and got ready to create
<>the universe. From the face of the Supreme Lord and
<>creator of the universes came out Brahma1 with five faces.
<>In the same way, S4iva with three eyes and matted hair,
<>and trident and rosary of beads (Elaeo carpus) and with
<>attribute of ‘Tamas’ (darkness--destruction) also came
<>out. Both Brahma1 and S4iva were filled with egoism and
<>both began to quarrel with each other. It was a contest
<>as to who was greater. The contest ended in attack.
<>S4iva plucked off the fifth head of Brahma1, when the
<>same face, flushed with anger, scolded S4iva. The head
<>fell into the hands of S4iva, who could not throw it down
<>as it didn't come off from his hand. Brahma1 cursed
<>S4iva and made him polluted. Since S4iva became polluted, [Page194-a+ 64]
<>his wife Sati1 also was considered as polluted by Daks2a.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) Once the praja1patis performed a sacrifice. Brahma1,
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva were present there. Daks2a, who had been
<>invited by the praja1patis also was present. When Daks2a
<>entered the hall his son-in-law S4iva did not rise up.
<>This arrogance of S4iva made Daks2a angry. Daks2a made
<>up his mind to take vengeance on S4iva, and performed
<>a sacrifice known as Br2haspatisavana. To that sacrifice
<>he did not invite S4iva or Sati1.
<NI>Hearing that her father was conducting a sacrifice Sati1
<>came uninvited. But Daks2a did not even look at her.
<>Sati1devi whose heart was broken at this treatment made
<>a fire and jumped into it and died. S4iva became furious
<>when he came to know of this. Being overwhelmed with
<>sorrow and anger he beat his matted hair on the ground,
<>from which two monsters, Vi1rabhadra and Bhadraka1li1,
<>came out. They ran to Daks2a's sacrificial hall and des-
<>troyed everything they saw, killed everybody, caught
<>hold of Daks2a and cut off his head. Then they began to
<>create havoc in the whole world. The hermits and
<>sages began to take to flight. Men and animals shivered.
<>Thus the three worlds began to tremble with fear. The
<>gods approached S4iva with supplication to curb his
<>anger. The gracious S4an3kara was pleased to recall the
<>monsters. After that everybody requested him to bring
<>Daks2a back to life. But the search made for the head of
<>Daks2a was futile. At last Brahma1 took the head of a
<>goat and joined it to the headless trunk of Daks2a. Thus
<>he was brought to life again.
<F>1. Though Daks2a was brought to life again with the head of a goat there is no mention of him again in the Pura1n2as. We hear of
<>Daks2a again as the son of Ma1ris2a1.</F> (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 7).
<NI>4) {%Cursing Candra.%} Candra had married twentyseven
<>daughters of Daks2a. But he showed particular attach-
<>ment to Rohin2i1. The other twentysix wives could not
<>bear this. They made a complaint to their father Daks2a.
<>Daks2a called Candra and advised him to show equal
<>attachment to all his wives and not to show any partia-
<>lity to anyone. Candra did not gainsay his father-in-
<>law, but he did not make any change in his disposition.
<>After a few days all the daughters except Rohin2i went
<>to the palace of Daks2a and told him that they were
<>going to stay with him. This time Daks2a got angry and
<>called Candra and cursed him to become a sick man
<>(of consumption).
<NI>From that day onwards Candra became a patient affec-
<>ted with consumption. All the vegetations in the world
<>began to weaken. It appeared that the world was
<>about to be destroyed. So the gods approached Daks2a
<>and requested him to show some leniency towards
<>Candra. Daks2a accordingly called Candra and told
<>him that he would be affected by consumption only for a
<>fortnight and after that he would recover gradually.
<>Candra went to Prabha1sa ti1rtha and Sarasvati1 ti1rtha and
<>dipped in water. He began to recover from that day.
<>It is according to the curse of Daksa that Candra (Moon)
<>waxes and wanes. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 35).
<NI>5) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(1) Daks2a has another name ‘Kan’.
<>“Daks2a the Praja1pati is a son of ten fathers. He has
<>two names. They are Daks2a and Kan.” (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 208, Stanza 7).
<NI>(2) When the emperor Pr2thu milked the earth, Daks2a [Page194-b+ 63]
<>was crowned as the King of the subjects. (See under
<>Pr2thu).
<NI>(3) It occurs in Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>11, Stanza 18, that Daks2a was a member of the assemibly
<>of Brahma1.
<NI>(4) Daks2a was one of those who visited Bhi1s2ma in his
<>bed of arrows. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 47).
<NI>(5) Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 166 that the devas, the manes, the gandharvas,
<>the celestial maids, the Ra1ks2asas, animals and birds,
<>fishes and all living creatures were born from the daugh-
<>ters of Daks2a.
<HI>DAKSASA1VARN2I. The name of the ninth Manu.
<>During the regime of this Manu, there will be three
<>classes of devas (gods) called the Parn2as, the Mari1ci-
<>garbhas and the Sudharmans. Each of these gan2as or
<>classes will consist of twelve devas or gods. Indra, their
<>King will be known as Adbhuta. He will be mighty and
<>powerful. In that Manvantara (age of the Manu)
<>Savana, Dyutima1n, Bhavya, Vasu, Medha1tithi,
<>Jyotis2ma1n and Satya will be the Saptars2is (the seven
<>hermits) and Dhr2taketu, Di1ptiketu, Pan5cahasta, Nira1-
<>maya, Pr2thus4rava and others will be the sons of Manu,
<>Daks2asa1varn2i. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 2).
<HI>DA1KS2A1YAN2I. Daughter of Daks2a. This name is gene-
<>rally used for all the daughters of Daks2a. Occasionally
<>this name is used for the grand daughters of Daks2a
<>also.
<HI>DAKS2IN2A1. A daughter, born to Praja1pati Ruci, by his
<>wife A1ku1ti. The first Manu was Sva1yambhuva, the son
<>of Brahma1. He accepted S4ataru1pa1, his sister who be-
<>came sinless by penance, as his wife. S4ataru1pa1 gave birth
<>to two sons Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da, and two
<>daughters, Prasu1ti and A1ku1ti. Of these two daughters,
<>Prasu1ti1 was given to Praja1pati Daks2a and A1ku1ti to
<>Praja1pati Ruci. A1ku1ti gave birth to twins, a son named
<>Yajn5a and a daughter named Daks2in2a1. To Yajn5a
<>twelve sons were born by Daks2in2a1. They were a class
<>of devas (gods) called the Ya1mas in the regime of Manu
<>Sva1yambhuva (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 7).
<>Now Daks2in2a1 is worshipped as a goddess. The same
<>Daks2in2a1 was reborn in the Goloka under the name
<>Sus4i1la1. At that time she was a cowherd woman and
<>friend of Ra1dha1. She liked to talk with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. One
<>day Ra1dha1 saw her sitting in the lap of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>engaged in sexual sports, in a secluded place. When
<>Sus4i1la1 saw that Ra1dha1 had found them out, she be-
<>came dumbfounded with shame, and sat with bowed
<>head. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a slowly placed Sus4i1la1 devi down and
<>instantly vanished. The angry Ra1dha1 cursed Sus4i1la1 to
<>become ashes if ever she entered the Goloka again. Then
<>Ra1dha1 ran about everywhere in search of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>but he could not be found.
<NI>Immediately after the curse, Sus4i1la1 got down from the
<>Goloka and began to worship Maha1laks2mi1 with devotion
<>and meditation and very severe fast and vow. After
<>a long time Maha1laks2mi1 appeared to her and blessed
<>her, and Sus4i1la1 became absorbed in Maha1laks2mi1.
<>Since the absorption of Sus4i1la1 devi1, who was the rebirth
<>of Daks2in2a1devi1, in Maha1laks2mi1, the sacrifice of the
<>devas (gods) became fruitless. They were much grieved.
<>They all went to Brahma1 to find a solution. As the matter
<>was serious Brahma1 meditated upon Vis2n2u, who [Page195-a+ 65]
<>became pleased with Brahma1 and to save the devas, he
<>attracted Daks2in2a1devi1 from the body of Maha1laks2mi1
<>and gave her as a present to Brahma1. Brahma1 gave that
<>devi1 (goddess) to Yajn5apurus2a (the god of sacrifice)
<>so that the sacrifices of gods might become fruitful.
<>When Yajn5apurus2a saw that supernatural beauty he was
<>overpowered by lust and swooned. The couple spent a
<>hundred divine years in seclusion enjoying the company
<>of each other, as a result of which devi1 became pregnant.
<>The pregnancy matured in twelve divine years and she
<>gave birth to a child which was named Phalada. It is
<>this same Phalada, the son of Yajn5apurus2a and Daks2in2a1
<>who awards fruits to all actions. The learned men say
<>that Yajn5apurus2a, Daks2in2a1devi1 and Phalada divide the
<>fruits of actions among the doers. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).
<HI>DAKS2IN2A1GNI. A strong wind born from the fire

<>under control. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30).
<HI>DAKS2IN2APA1N5CA1LA. A place famous in the Pura1n2as.
<>This place lies to the south of the Ganges up to the river
<>Cam3pat. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 14, Stanza 27, that the King of this country
<>fled to the south fearing Jara1sandha. Pa1n5ca1la lies to the
<>south and north of the Ganges. But the country was
<>divided into two when Dron2a defeated Drupada the
<>King of Pa1n5ca1la, and took away from him the part of the
<>country north of the Ganges. After that, the part taken
<>by Dron2a was called Uttarapa1n5ca1la and the part south
<>of the Ganges was called Daks2in2apa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 137).
<HI>DAKS2IN2ASINDHU. A holy place. This place is on the
<>shore of the southern sea. If one visits this place and

<>Va1madeva was the priest of this King. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 192). See Pari1ks2it II.
<HI>DA1LBHYA (BAKADA1LBHYA). A Mahars2i of Naimi-
<>s4a1ran2ya. In Va1mana Pura1n2a, there is a story of how this
<>sage once performed a homa and burnt Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>kingdom in the sacrificial fire.
<NI>Long ago some of the sages of Naimis4a1ran2ya approached
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra with a request for some money. Their
<>leader was the sage Da1lbhya (Baka). It was he who
<>begged Dhr2tara1s2t2ra for money. The king not only
<>refused to give money, but also insulted the sage. Pro-
<>voked at this, Da1lbhya began performing a homa in [Page195-b+ 65]
<>which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's kingdom was the havis in the form
<>of sliced meat. This homa was performed in Avaki1rn2a-
<>maha1ti1rtha at Pr2thu1daka. As a result of it the kingdom
<>began to decline. The King was alarmed and consulted
<>great scholars and astrologers about the cause of the
<>country's decline. They told him that the cause of the
<>disaster was Da1lbhya's homa. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra at once pro-
<>ceeded with rich presents to propitiate Da1lbhya at
<>Avaki1rn2amaha1ti1rtha. Da1lbhya was pleased and as
<>desired by the King, performed homa with milk and
<>honey and revived all those who had died. (Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 39).
<NI>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 11 says
<>that this Mahar2s2i flourished in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly.
<>On another occasion, he is referred to, as coming to
<>Dyumatsena, the father of Satyava1n. At that time, he
<>comforted Dyumatsena by saying that Satyava1n would be
<>blessed with longevity. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>298, Verse 17).
<HI>DA1LBHYAM. A holy place in North India. (M.B.

<>tion about Dama is available in the Pura1n2as.
<HI>DAMA II. A hermit. He was one of the hermits who

<>158, Verse 40).
<HI>DAMAGHOS2A. The father of S4is4upa1la, the King of
<>Cedi. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 186, Stanza 86).
<HI>DAMANA I. A brother of Damayanti1. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 8 it is mentioned that
<>King Bhi1ma had a daughter named Damayanti1, and
<>three sons named Dama, Da1nta and Damana.
<HI>DAMANA II. A hermit. Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha
<>pleased this hermit, who blessed the King and said that
<>he would get children. Accordingly the king got Dama-
<>yanti1 as his daughter and Dama, Da1nta and Damana
<>as his sons. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<HI>DAMANA III. The son of the King Paurava. Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna killed Damana in the battle of Bha1rata. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 61, Stanza 20).
<HI>DAMANA IV. A son of Bharadva1ja. After the investiture
<>with the Brahma string (upanayana) Damana started
<>on a travel. On the way near Amarakan2t2aka he met
<>with the hermit Garga who talked to him about the
<>glory of Ka1s4i. Damana who was a seeker of spiritual

<HI>DAMANAKA II. A daitya (asura) Maha1vis2n2u in his
<>incarnation as Matsya (Matsya1vata1ra), killed this asura
<>who was a dweller of the sea. Vis2n2u threw the body of
<>the asura into the earth. By the touch of the Lord the
<>body became fragrant and it was changed to a plant
<>which is known as (Kozhunnu or Kozhuntu) Dama-
<>nakam. (Skanda Pura1n2a). [Page196-a+ 64]
<HI>DAMANAKAM. The Ta1tiri tree (Grislea Tomentosa).
<>The ceremony of worshipping this tree is called Dama-
<>naka1rohan2avidhi. The Grislea tree is supposed to be
<>Bhairava, who had been changed to a tree by the curse
<>of S4iva. A story to this effect occurs in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Bhairava was formed from the anger of S4iva. Bhairava,
<>against the will of S4iva, destroyed the devas, and so
<>S4iva cursed him and turned him to a Ta1tiri tree. It is
<>called Damanaka because Bhairava tried to do ‘damana’
<>(restraint or punishment) to the gods.
<NI>Bhairava felt sorry at the curse of S4iva. He requested
<>S4iva to withdraw the curse. At last S4iva had pity on him
<>and said that all would worship Damanaka tree. The
<>method of that worship is called Damanaka1rohan2a-
<>vidhi. It is given below:
<NI>This tree should be worshipped on the seventh or thir-
<>teenth lunar day. The worshipper should go to the
<>tree, with those who recite mantras and spells. After
<>the worship is over the worshipper should say, “O,
<>Tree, which has originated by the power of Hari, you
<>come to my presence. On behalf of S4iva, and by his
<>order, I have to take you home.” Saying thus the
<>tree should be taken home and consecrated in the even-
<>ing in accordance with the rituals. In the house, the
<>Sun, S4iva and Agni should be evoked and worshipped
<>and then the root of the tree should be planted in the
<>I1s4a1na (N.E. point) corner of the house and when it
<>is planted, the spell or incantation of Va1madeva Mantra
<>or S4iromantra should be recited. In the same way
<>the trunk with the branches of the tree is planted on
<>the Northern part. The fallen leaves and flowers
<>should be placed on the eastern side. When the root
<>is planted the following prayer should be uttered:
<Poem>A1mantritosi deves4a
<>pra1tah2 ka1le maya1 prabho /
<>Kartavyastapaso la1bha1h2
<>Pu1rn2am3 sarvam3 tava1jn5aya1. //</Poem>
<>After that at dawn he should take bath and with obla-
<>tions of sweet-smelling flowers etc. should worship
<>S4iva. This is Damanaka1rohan2avidhi. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 80).
<HI>DAMAYANTI1 Daughter of Bhi1ma the King of Vidar-
<>bha. The most noble of all the Indian heroines, Dama-
<>yanti1 has secured a place in the literatures of almost
<>all the languages in the world. The famous hero Nala
<>is her huband.
<NI>1) {%The background of the story of Nala.%} During the time
<>of the forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas, Arjuna had gone to
<>Kaila1sa to do penance before S4iva for getting divine
<>weapons. The rest of the Pa1n2d2avas spent the time
<>till the arrival of Arjuna, in sorrow and sadness. They
<>spent miserable days one by one. At that time the her-
<>mit Br2hadas4va visited them. They welcomed the
<>hermit. In the midst of their conversation Dharma-
<>putra told the hermit with tears that he was the most
<>unhappy man in the world. Hearing this the hermit
<>told them the story of Nala, to console the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>2) {%The birth of Damayanti1.%} The King Bhi1ma of Vidar-
<>bha was childless for a long time. While the King was
<>spending sorrowful days, as he had no children, a
<>hermit named Dama reached his palace. The King
<>welcomed the hermit. Seeing the sorrow of the King the
<>hermit blessed the King and the queen, and as a result
<>a daughter named Damayanti1 and as her brothers [Page196-b+ 64]
<>three sons Dama, Da1nta and Damana were born to
<>them.
<NI>3) {%The Svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1.%} During
<>this period a son named Nala was born to Vi1rasena the
<>King of Nis2adha. The child was an expert in the game
<>of dice and he would speak only truth. He grew up
<>and became a youth.
<NI>Once the swans which came to the palace of Dama-
<>yanti1 from Nala, began to praise Nala. They sang
<>about the glory of Nala. Nala also knew about the
<>beauty and the other good qualities of Damayanti1.
<>Thus they fell in love with each other. Nala also started
<>for Kun2d2inapuri1, the capital city of Vidarbha, to marry
<>Damayanti1. The devas (gods) Indra, Agni, Varun2a
<>and Yama, having heard of the beauty of Damayanti1
<>from Na1rada, had gone Kun2d2inapuri1, to take part
<>in the marriage. On the way they met Nala. They
<>were aware of the fact that Damayanti1 was in love
<>with Nala. So they called Nala and sent him to Dama-
<>yanti1 with a message that Damayanti1 should accept
<>one of the four gods as her husband. By the boon of
<>invisibility, given by the Gods, Nala entered the room
<>of Damayanti1 unseen by others and gave the message
<>to Damayanti1. But Damayanti1 did not agree to it.
<>The Gods also entered the nuptial hall and took their
<>seats in the shape of four Nalas. Damayanti1 entered
<>the hall with the nuptial garland in her hands. She
<>saw five Nalas including the real Nala, and prayed to
<>the gods to show her the real Nala her lover. So the
<>devas assumed their real forms and Damayanti1 put
<>the garland on the neck of the real Nala and accepted
<>him as her husband. Being much pleased with the be-
<>haviour and character of both Nala and Damayanti1,
<>the four gods blessed them. Agni promised to be near
<>Nala whenever he thought of him. Yama said that
<>Nala would always be righteous. Varun2a said that
<>Nala would obtain water at the thought of it. Indra
<>blessed him saying that he would get moks2a immedia-
<>tely after the completion of a ya1ga. The gods remained
<>till the end of the marriage ceremony and then they
<>departed. Nala and Damayanti1 lived in Kun2d2inapuri1.
<NI>4) {%The hatred between Kali and Dva1para.%} Hearing about
<>the Svayamvara of Damayanti1 Kali and Dva1para
<>started for Kun2d2inapuri1. On the way they met Indra
<>and the other gods, who were returning from the marri-
<>age of Damayanti1. They told Kali and Dva1para that
<>Damayanti1 had accepted Nala as her husband. Kali
<>and Dva1para got angry at this and returned saying
<>that they would destroy the kingdom of Nala. After
<>that Kali waited for a chance to enter the body of
<>Nala. After twelve years, once Nala, after passing
<>urine, without washing his legs performed his evening
<>worship. At that moment Kali entered the body of
<>Nala. With that Nala became bereft of all senses of
<>righteousness and duty, and challenged his younger
<>brother Pus2kara to a game of dice. Pus2kara engaged
<>Nala in the game of dice. Kali stood in the shape of
<>an ox as helper of Nala. Nala lost his kingdom in the
<>game. Seeing that her husband was being defeated
<>continuously, Damayanti1 sent for the charioteer Va1rs2-
<>n2eya and sent her son Indrasena and daughter Indra-
<>sena1 to Kun2d2inapuri1. After leaving the children at Kun2d2i-
<>napuri1 Va1rs2n2eya engaged himself in a travel. After
<>visiting several countries he reached Ayodhya1 and [Page197-a+ 65]
<>became the charioteer of King R2tuparn2a.
<NI>5) {%Nala and Damayanti1 to the forest.%} Pus2kara got the
<>kingdom, wealth and everything that his elder brother,
<>Nala, had possessed. The miserable Nala left every-
<>thing he had and clad in only one cloth got out of the
<>palace. His wife Damayanti1 followed him. They stayed
<>outside the city for three days. Pus2kara made a pro-
<>clamation that if anybody rendered any help to Nala
<>he would be ruthlessly put to death. After that Nala stay-
<>ed there for three more days, with only water for food
<>and drink. Then he went to the forest. His wife followed
<>him. They were hungry. Nala saw some golden birds.
<>Nala wanted to catch them for food. So he took his
<>only cloth and spread it on the ground. The birds
<>took that cloth and flew away. Those birds were the
<>dices used in the game. They were influenced by
<>Kali. The miserable and hungerstricken Nala asked
<>his wife Damayanti1 to go with the caravan traders
<>who were going to Avanti and save herself. But she
<>did not consent to go away from him.
<NI>They spent that night in an inn. They both fell asleep
<>because of weakness. After a time Nala woke up.
<>He thought that his wife would somehow or other
<>get to some country closeby and save herself, if he
<>left her there. So he decided to take half of her cloth.
<>How to do it without her knowledge? Thinking so he
<>walked round the inn. He saw a good sword. He
<>took the sword, and cut half of the cloth of Damayanti1
<>and leaving her in the inn he went away.
<NI>In a short while she woke up and missing her husband
<>she cried aloud and ran here and there in search of
<>him. Then she went into the forest crying. A big snake
<>caught hold of her and began to swallow her. She cried
<>aloud. Hearing the cry, a forester came there. He
<>cut the snake open and saved Damayanti1. But when
<>he saw her he became overpowered by libido and
<>tried to make her his wife. She got angry and cursed
<>him and he instantly fell down dead. After this she
<>began to wander in the forest aimlessly, often seeing
<>wild animals and fearing them. At last she got on a
<>rock and sat there and began to wail thinking of Nala.
<NI>6) {%Damayanti1 in the kingdom of Cedi.%} While she was
<>sitting on the rock wailing, a caravan of traders came
<>by that way. They had been attacked by a herd of
<>elephants and were running away from them. They
<>saw Damayanti1. She told them her story. They brought
<>her to the kingdom of Cedi. She wandered through
<>the country for a while and finally reached the palace
<>of the King Suba1hu. Thinking her to be a mad wo-
<>man the street boys were following her. The queen
<>saw the woman surrounded by street boys and felt
<>pity for her. She sent her maid and brought her to
<>the palace. Without revealing that she was the queen
<>of King Nala, she told everything else to the queen.
<>The queen consoled her and said that she would get her
<>husband back. She invited Damayanti1 to stay in the
<>palace till she got her husband back. Damayanti1
<>replied as follows: “Mother, I shall stay here. But
<>there are certain conditions. I won't eat remains and
<>offals of victuals, I won't make others to wash my legs.
<>I won't talk with men who are not related to me. If
<>anybody hankers after me you must order him to be
<>killed. Bra1hman2as may come and see me only in con-
<>nection with the search for my husband. This is my
<>vow.” The queen agreed to her conditions and made [Page197-b+ 65]
<>her the attendant of her daughter Sunanda1.
<NI>7) {%Nala in Ayodhya1.%} Nala filled with sorrow was walk-
<>ing along the forest when he saw a wild fire. From the
<>midst of the fire somebody was calling Nala by name
<>and crying. When Nala approached the fire, he saw
<>the great and famous serpent Karkot2aka lying entwined
<>in the flames. Karkot2aka the King of the Na1gas had
<>once deceived Na1rada, who then cursed him that he
<>would become stationary in a place like an immovable
<>thing till Nala came and rescued him. From that day
<>onwards, Karkot2aka was remaining in that forest with-
<>out moving. Then the forest caught fire. Karkot2aka
<>being unable to move had to remain in the fire. Nala
<>immediately saved Karkot2aka from the fire and with
<>that he was absolved from the curse of Na1rada. Kar-
<>kot2aka asked Nala to walk forward, counting the steps.
<>When Nala counted ten, Karkot2aka bit on the leg of
<>Nala and he became ugly. Then the serpent said to
<>the flurried Nala, “Don't fear. I have made you ugly
<>so that others may not recognize you. Now you are
<>ugly because of my poison. But my poison has affected
<>Kali who is in your body. Because he had harmed
<>you who are blameless, he has to suffer for it. So long
<>as this poison is in you, nobody will harm you. You
<>must go to R2tuparn2a the King of Ayodhya1 and tell
<>him that you are Ba1huka a charioteer. You must give
<>R2tuparn2a the spell ‘As4vahr2daya mantra’ and get
<>from him the spell ‘Aks2ahr2dayamantra’. After that
<>you will have reunion with your wife and children.
<>Here are two cloths for you. Whenever you want
<>to get your original form you need only wear them.”
<>Saying these words Karkot2aka gave Nala two divine
<>garments and then disappeared.
<NI>Nala started for Ayodhya1. He reached the palace
<>on the tenth day. There he was employed as the horse
<>keeper of R2tuparn2a on a pay of hundred pieces of gold.
<>Thus he stayed there under the name Ba1huka. Va1rs2n2eya
<>and Ji1vala who were the horse-keepers of R2tuparn2a
<>upto that time, were placed under Ba1huka.
<NI>Ba1huka used to recite a poem every evening when he
<>returned from his work.
<Poem>Weary and worn of hunger and thirst,
<>That poor woman, where might she be?
<>Serving whom will she be now.
<>Thinking of the unlucky fool?</Poem>
<NI>Hearing this song of lamentation everyday, once his
<>assistant Ji1vala asked Ba1huka, whom he was reciting
<>the poem about. Ba1huka replied: “Once there was
<>a man who was a fool. He got a good wife. For some
<>reason they were separated. The fool is still wandering
<>about weary and sad in search of his wife.”
<NI>8) {%Damayanti1 in Kun2d2inapura.%} At this time Dama-
<>yanti1 was living in the palace of the King of Cedi,
<>as the maid of princess Sunanda1. King Bhi1ma became
<>very sorry not knowing where Nala and Damayanti1
<>had gone. He sent men in all directions to search for
<>them. The King proclaimed that those who found
<>them would be awarded thousand cows, lands assigned
<>to Brahmins, and villages. He proclaimed that so
<>many cows would be given even to those who could
<>give any information about them. Hearing this Bra1h-
<>man2as went in all directions and Sudeva, one of them,
<>reached the Kingdom of Cedi. He recognized Dama-
<>yanti1 who was like fire inside the cover of smoke. When
<>Damayanti1 was alone Sudeva approached her and [Page198-a+ 65]
<>said that he had come from Vidarbha and that he was
<>a friend of Damayanti1's brother. Damayanti1 recog-
<>nized Sudeva and she cried aloud. Sunanda1 who saw
<>this scene, told her mother about it. The queen sent
<>for Sudeva and asked him what the matter was. He
<>revealed everything about Damayanti1, to the queen.
<>When they heard the story all the women in the harem
<>cried. Then with tears the queen said, “Hear this,
<>Damayanti1, your mother and myself are the two daugh-
<>ters of Sudama the King of Das4a1rn2a. Father gave
<>your mother to Bhi1ma the King of Vidarbha and me
<>to Vi1raba1hu the King of Cedi. I have seen you when
<>you were an infant.”
<NI>When the King of Cedi knew everything he sent Dama-
<>yanti1 in a palanquin to Vidarbha.
<NI>9) {%The search for Nala.%} Damayanti1 told her father
<>that she didn't want to live any longer unless Nala
<>was brought to her. Bhi1ma had been trying hard to
<>find out Nala. One day Parn2a1da one of the numerous
<>Brahmins who were engaged in the search for Nala,
<>came to Bhi1ma and said, “while I was wandering from
<>place to place, I happened to reach the palace of R2tu-
<>parn2a the King of Ayodhya1. There I made enquiries
<>about Nala the husband of Damayanti1, in the pre-
<>sence of the King. But nobody gave me any answer.
<>When I returned Ba1huka the charioteer of R2tuparn2a
<>followed me. An ugly man with short hands, an ex-
<>pert in driving horses, and an excellent cook, he asked
<>me several questions about Damayanti1.”
<NI>When Damayanti1 heard this she had horripilation.
<>She secretly went to her mother and compelled her
<>to send Sudeva the Bra1hman2a to Ayodhya1. Her mother
<>consented. She called Sudeva, in the presence of her
<>mother and told him to go to Ayodhya1 and tell R2tuparn2a
<>that the second svayam3vara (marriage) of Damayanti1
<>would take place before sunrise next day and that
<>he should come earlier. Sudeva instantly went to
<>Ayodhya1.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, hearing the words of Sudeva, wanted
<>Ba1huka to take him in the chariot to Vidarbha within
<>the period of a day time for the second svayam3vara
<>of Damayanti1. Nala consented with a breaking heart.
<>Immediately they started. Va1rs2n2eya also got into
<>the chariot. The chariot flew through the sky with
<>tremendous speed, to Vidarbha. On the way the upper
<>garment of the King fell on the ground. He ordered
<>the chariot to be stopped for taking his upper garment.
<>Nala said that within that winking time the chariot
<>had travelled a yojana (league) and gloried in his
<>power of driving horses. Then they saw in the forest
<>a Tanni tree (Terminalia bellerica) with fruits. Seeing
<>the Tanni tree the King said, “O Ba1huka, if you are
<>an expert in horse-driving I am an expert in reckoning.
<>I will tell you how many leaves and nuts there are
<>in that Tanni Tree. There are five crores of leaves in
<>both the branches together and two thousand and
<>ninetyfive nuts. They stopped the chariot and checked
<>the tree and found the reckoning of the King correct.
<>The King had the knowledge of the art called ‘Aks2ahr2-
<>daya’. It was with this art that the king calculated
<>the number of leaves in the tree, at one look. Ba1huka
<>drove the chariot with the speed of wind because he had
<>known the art called ‘As4vahr2daya’. Then and there,
<>Ba1huka taught the King the art of ‘As4vahr2daya’ and
<>the King taught Ba1huka the art of ‘Aks2ahr2daya’. The [Page198-b+ 65]
<>moment Nala learned Aks2ahr2daya Kali vomitted
<>the poison of Karkot2aka and got out of the body of
<>Nala. Long ago, the mother of Indrasena, a god, had
<>cursed Kali and drove him out. Since then Kali had
<>been living in the body of Nala. As soon as he came
<>out Kali begged Nala for pardon. Nala curbed his
<>anger. But Kali was afraid of Nala. So he made the
<>Tanni tree his abode. Because of that Tanni became
<>detestable.
<NI>R2tuparn2a, Va1rs2n2eya and Ba1huka reached Kun2d2ina-
<>pura in the evening. When the sound of the chariot
<>of Nala reached the ears of Damayanti1 her heart bumped
<>with joy. The chariot was stopped and R2tuparn2a
<>entered the palace. The King Bhi1ma welcomed
<>R2tuparn2a heartily. As there was no sign of any prepara-
<>tion for the svayam3vara (marriage) R2tuparn2a under-
<>stood that some sort of trick had been played on him.
<NI>10) {%Test of Nala.%} Damayanti1 sent her maid Kes4ini1
<>to Ba1huka to watch him. Kes4ini1 had a secret talk
<>with Ba1huka. Though Nala did not reveal himself,
<>he cried when she talked about Damayanti1. Kes4ini1
<>returned to Damayanti1 and told her what she had
<>heard and seen. Damayanti1 became more and more
<>convinced that Ba1huka was Nala himself So she sent
<>Kes4ini1 again to Nala. She discovered the following
<>facts about Ba1huka, after a keen observation, and
<>made a report of them.
<NI>(1) Ba1huka does not stop to pass through even a small
<>door. The upper sill lifts by itself for him to pass
<>through.
<NI>(2) He gets enough room for him to pass through even
<>a big crowd.
<NI>(3) Empty pots are filled with water at a look from him.
<NI>(4) When he stretches out a grass to the sun, it catches
<>fire.
<NI>(5) Fire does not burn him even if he touches it.
<NI>(6) When he crushes a flower, it blooms more beauti-
<>ful and fragrant than before.
<NI>When Kes4ini1 said all these facts to Damayanti1, she
<>became fully convinced that Ba1huka was none other
<>than Nala himself. Damayanti1 sent Kes4ini1 again to
<>Ba1huka to get some meat cooked by him. Damayanti1
<>tested the taste of the meat brought by Kes4ini1 and
<>she knew that the food was cooked by Nala. She
<>sent Kes4ini1 again to Ba1huka with her children. See-
<>ing Indrasena and Indrasena1 coming to him, Ba1huka
<>ran to them, gathered them and embraced them and
<>cried aloud. Then he told Kes4ini1 that he had done
<>so because the children were just like his two child-
<>ren.
<NI>11) {%Reunion.%} After having tested Ba1huka so far Dama-
<>yanti1 sent Kes4ini1 to her mother to tell her everything,
<>and to say that she was convinced of the fact that
<>Ba1huka was none other than Nala and that the diffe-
<>rence was only in shape and to request that she may
<>be permitted to see Ba1huka in person. The queen
<>informed the King of all these facts. With the permis-
<>sion of her parents Ba1huka was brought to the room
<>of Damayanti1. The moment Ba1huka saw Damayanti1
<>he began to shed tears. Damayanti1 also was filled
<>with emotion. But she told him thus:--
<NI>“Ba1huka, have you seen a man who had left his sleep-
<>ing wife in the forest? Who else, but Nala the famous
<>and the righteous would discard his blameless and
<>loving wife who had been sleeping, with fatigue and [Page199-a+ 65]
<>hunger in a lonely place? Have I done anything
<>wrong to him in my younger days so that he should
<>leave me in the forest when I was sleeping? Leaving
<>aside real gods I married him. I worshipped, him. I had
<>children from his blood and now he has abandoned
<>me. In the presence of Gods and with fire as witness,
<>holding my hands he had taken a vow that he would
<>support and protect me. Where has that vow gone?”
<>At these words Ba1huka shed tears for a long time.
<>Then he told her all that had happened to him since
<>their separation. Damayanti1 requested Nala, not to
<>have any misconception regarding the idea of a second
<>svayam3vara; she said to him that she committed no
<>wrong and that her fidelity and loyalty had undergone
<>no change. At that time Va1yu (the wind-god) in an
<>etherial voice said “Damayanti1 has committed no
<>sin”. Immediately Nala put on the divine clothes
<>given by Karkot2aka and regained his original form.
<>Damayanti1 embraced Nala and cried aloud. The king
<>her father, mother and the people of the city all ran
<>to them.
<NI>Next day R2tuparn2a returned. After a few days Nala
<>collected an army consisting of three hundred soldiers,
<>sixteen elephants, fifty horses and a white chariot only,
<>from Vidarbha and went to the kingdom of Nis2adha.
<>Reaching there Nala challenged Pus2kara for a game of
<>dice. Pus2kara refused the challenge. Nala took his
<>sword to cut Pus2kara into two. Finally Pus2kara agreed
<>to play. At the first cast of the dice the life and the
<>Kingdom of Pus2kara fell into the hands of Nala. But
<>Nala did not kill Pus2kara; instead, he embraced him.
<>Nala became King. Damayanti1 and the children reached
<>Nis2adha. Nala ruled the country with more happiness
<>and prosperity than before. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana
<>Parva, Chapters 52 to 79).

<>advised him to challenge Nara Na1ra1yan2as who were
<>doing penance on the northern-most point of the earth.
<>So the emperor went with his mighty army to Gandha-
<>ma1dana and informed Nara and Na1ra1yan2a of his desire
<>to fight. They said that they were mere hermits and
<>that they had no power to fight. But Dam3bhodbhava was
<>not satisfied. Finally Nara and Na1ra1yan2a took some
<>is2i1ka1 grass and began to fight the emperor with it.
<>Though the army of the emperor was mighty and vast
<>it could not stand against the grass in the hands of the [Page199-b+ 65]
<>hermits. Finally the emperor admitted failure and
<>bowed before the hermits. They advised him not to be
<>arrogant in future and to lead a pure life. Hearing the

<>and entered the temple. Inside the temple he saw Kr2s2n2a,
<>clad in yellow robes lying on a beautiful cot, with his
<>spouse Ra1dha1. The thief instantly bowed before the
<>spouse of Ra1dha1. By this act his sins were washed away.
<>Still impelled by his evil nature, he took the silk garment
<>of Kr2s2n2a, spread it on the ground, collected as many
<>things as he could take, placed them in the garment and
<>making them into a bundle, got out of the temple
<>with shaky feet. The bundle fell on the ground with a
<>loud noise. Hearing the noise the neighbours woke up
<>and looked out. The thief began to run and was bitten
<>by a poisonous snake and fell down dead. The men of
<>Yama (God of death) tied the spirit of the thief with a
<>rope and took him before Yama. Citragupta looked
<>into his accounts and informed Yama that he had
<>committed all the sins. Yama asked if there was any
<>good deed to his account. Then Citragupta said “When
<>this great sinner was going to commit theft in a Vais2n2a-
<>vite temple, at the steps of the temple, he levelled a pit
<>by the mud on his leg, and that single good deed on
<>his part has wiped out all his sins.” Hearing this Yama
<>gave him a golden seat and showed hospitality and then
<>bowed before him and said “By the soil on your legs you
<>have purified my abode today. I am grateful to you.
<>Now you may go to the blissful world of Vis2n2u where
<>there are no deaths or births or sorrow”. Hearing this
<>Dan2d2a entered Vaikun2t2ha. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 1).

<>was cut off and the infantry of fourteen thousand giants
<>who came under the leadership of Khara, Du1s2an2a and
<>Tris4ira was completely destroyed. Si1ta1 was stolen,

<HI>DAN2D2ANI1TI. (The laws of chastisement). Dan2d2a-
<>ni1ti is the law of punishment given to the subjects
<>by Kings of ancient India. According to the criminal
<>laws of ancient India, fining a man upto two hundred
<>and fifty pan2as (a coin) was called Prathama S4a1hasa
<>dan2d2a (first degree of punishment) and fining up to
<>five hundred pan2as was called Madhyama Sa1hasa [Page201-b+ 65]
<>dan2d2a (medium punishment) and fining upto thou-
<>sand pan2as was called Uttama Sa1hasa dan2d2a (highest
<>degree of punishment). If a man complains to
<>the King that his property is stolen, when actually
<>it is not stolen, the man will be fined the amount
<>that is said to have been stolen. There was another
<>law, that the owner of the stolen property and
<>the thief would have to pay double the amount
<>they admit, if the amount shown in the complaint
<>differed from the actual amount stolen. For appear-
<>ing as false witness, the three classes of non-Brahmins
<>were punished with fine and if he was a Brahmin he
<>would have to be cast out of the society. The King
<>ordered that if one spent the property entrusted with
<>him for keeping, the owner of the property would
<>have to be paid double the amount. If one says that
<>he has given the property for keeping when actually
<>it is not, the person will have to be punished as if he
<>were a thief. If a man spends an amount without
<>knowing that it was the property of others, the man
<>will have to be acquitted of the charge.
<NI>If an artisan has received money in advance for a parti-
<>cular product and fails to give the thing at the stipu-
<>lated time the King will fine the artisan one svarn2a.
<>If a man received money in advance on a promise to
<>do a particular work and if he fails to do the work he
<>will be fined one Kr2s2n2ala of gold. (One Kr2s2n2ala
<>weighs three yavagrains). If a man conceals his diseases
<>and marries a damsel, she will be considered as a spins-
<>ter and the man will be fined two hundred pan2as.
<>If a cowherd agrees to look after the cows of another
<>receiving pay and food and refuses to return the cow
<>to the owner the King will fine him hundred pan2as.
<>If a Ks2atriya scoffed a Bra1hman2a the fine imposed
<>would be hundred pan2as. If it is a Vais4ya the fine will
<>be two hundred pan2as. If it is a S4u1dra he will be put
<>to death. If a Brahmin scoffs a Ks2atriya the fine is
<>fifty pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Vais4ya the fine is twenty-
<>five pan2as. If a Brahmin scoffs a S4u1dra the fine is
<>only twelve pan2as. If a S4u1dra scoffs a Ks2atriya his
<>tongue should be cut off. If a S4u1dra advises a Brahmin,
<>he may inflict any punishment on the S4u1dra.
<NI>If a S4u1dra wronged a Brahmin, the S4u1dra might be
<>punished by cutting off the organ which was employed
<>in the crime. If one spat at a Brahmin, the two lips of
<>the culprit might be cut off. If a man passed urine on a
<>Brahmin the culprit would have his penis cut off. If
<>a S4u1dra sits on the seats of the upper classes his but-
<>tock will have to be cut off. If one slays cow, elephant,
<>camel or horse half of his limbs will have to be cut
<>off. Cutting across a road, changing of boundaries,
<>making the water of pools and ponds impure etc. will
<>have to be punished with a fine of two suvarn2as. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 227).
<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I I. A king of the family of Yaya1ti.

<NI>DAN2D2APA1N2I II. The son of Paun2d2raka, the King
<>of Ka1s4i. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Paun2d2raka. As his son
<>Dan2d2apa1n2i was not powerful enough to kill S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>he performed the sacrifice of Mahes4vara yajn5a. Being
<>pleased at the sacrifice S4iva created Kr2tya1 in the
<>sacrificial fire and sent her to Dva1raka1 to destroy S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a, who aimed his Sudars4ana cakra (wheel-weapon)
<>at her. She ran to Va1ra1n2asi1, where the wheel turned [Page202-a+ 65]

<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Das4aratha was the son of Aja, of the family
<>of Iks2va1ku, born of his wife Indumati1.
<F>1) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 274, Stanza 6 that ‘Ilabila1, was the name of the mother of Das4aratha.</F>
<NI>3) {%Das4aratha's hunt.%} Once during the early part of his
<>life Das4aratha was walking through a forest engaged in
<>hunting. He reached the bank of the river Sarayu1.
<>It was evening and the forest was thick. He walked in
<>search of wild animals. The night was advancing and
<>darkness getting thicker. Then he heard a sound from
<>the river as if an elephant was drinking water. Thinking
<>it to be an elephant Das4aratha sent an arrow in the
<>direction from which the sound came. Instantly he heard
<>a man crying with pain. The king was disappointed.
<>He ran to the spot and saw a hermit boy lying in a pool
<>of blood beating his limbs on the ground and crying.
<>The waterpot he had been dipping in the water lay
<>close by. In answer to the questions of the King, the [Page204-a+ 65]
<>hermit boy whose name was S4ravan2a,
<F>1. In Agnipura1n2a Chapter 6, it is stated that the name of this hermit boy was Yajn5adatta.</F> said, “Oh
<>King! What wrong have I done? My parents are
<>sitting thirsty and blind with age, in the hermitage close-
<>by. I, their only son, was dipping the pot to take water
<>to them, when you sent the arrow at me. So, please take
<>some water to them in this pot and console them.”
<NI>Hearing this, with tears the King drew out the fatal
<>arrow from the body of the boy and with that the boy
<>S4ravan2a said good bye to the world. Das4aratha took
<>water in the pot and went in search of the hermitage in
<>the darkness. With difficulty he found out the hermitage
<>and as he drew near, the aged parents of the boy heard
<>his footsteps and called him eagerly. The King, with
<>tearful eyes told them what had happened. There was
<>loud wailing and crying in the hermitage. According to
<>their wish the King took them to where their son lay.
<>Then the King made a fire and placed the dead body
<>of the boy in it. The aged and blind parents cursed
<>Das4aratha, “You also will die of loss of children”.
<>Then they also entered the fire and were burnt along
<>with their son's dead body. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ayo-
<>dhya1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 63).
<NI>4) {%Marriage.%} Das4aratha had three wives, named
<>Kaus4alya1, Kaikeyi1 and Sumitra1.
<NI>5) {%Kaikeyi1 given a boon.%} There was a great battle in the
<>world of the gods between the asuras and the gods.
<>According to the request of the devas, Das4aratha went to
<>the world of the devas to help them. Kaikeyi1 also went
<>with Das4aratha. In a severe fight with S4ambara, an
<>asura, Das4aratha fell down unconscious. Kaikeyi1 took
<>him away from the battle-field. When he recovered the
<>King got into the chariot and fought more fiercely than
<>before. This time the wheel-bolt of one of the wheels of
<>the chariot of Das4aratha slipped away. Without inform-
<>ing her husband of this danger, Kaikeyi1 inserted her
<>finger into the bolt-hole and prevented the wheel from
<>sliding away. The King won the battle. After the battle,
<>when the King came to know of the services rendered
<>by Kaikeyi1, he promised her two boons. Kaikeyi1 told
<>the King that she would ask for them later, when she
<>needed them. Then they returned to Ayodhya1. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Sarga 9, Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Administration of Das4aratha.%} The capital of Das4a-
<>ratha's kingdom of Kosala, was Ayodhya1. This city was
<>situated on the bank of river Sarayu1. Das4aratha was as
<>famous in Ayodhya1 as Indra was in the realm of the
<>gods. There were palaces in Ayodhya1 for the kings who
<>brought tribute to stay. In short, as mentioned in
<>Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 5, Ayodhya1 was
<>the heaven on earth.
<NI>7) {%Ministers.%} Das4aratha had eight ministers, Sr2s2t2i,
<>Jayanta, Vijaya, Siddha1rtha, Ra1s2t2ravardhana, As4oka,
<>Dharmapa1la, and Sumantra. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 6).
<NI>8) {%The name Das4aratha.%} The real name of Das4aratha
<>was Nemi. Once the unattackable and invincible asura
<>S4am3bara conquered the throne of Indra. At the request
<>of Brahma1 and the gods, this King reached heaven and
<>destroyed the armies of the asuras very easily. S4am3bara
<>got angry, assumed ten shapes and attacked the King
<>from ten points at the same time. The king confronted
<>the ten S4am3baras at ten points, at the same time, and
<>killed all of them at the same moment. Because he
<>faced his chariot to ten points at the same time and
<>fought with enemies on those ten points Brahma1 appre- [Page204-b+ 64]
<>ciated his valiant fighting and charioteeering and gave
<>him the name ‘Das4aratha’ (one who is capable of driving
<>the chariot to ten points at the same time). Thus his
<>original name was forgotten and he came to be known
<>only by the name given him later. (Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>9) {%Birth of Sons.%} Kausalya1 was the first wife of Das4a-
<>ratha. She was the daughter of the King of Uttara
<>Kosala. A daughter named S4a1nta1 was born to Das4aratha
<>by Kausalya1. After this, no sons or daughters were born
<>to Das4aratha for a long time.
<NI>At this juncture Lomapa1da, the king of An3ga who was the
<>class-mate and a great friend of Das4aratha, came to
<>Ayodhya1 on a friendly visit. He also had no children.
<>So he entreated Das4aratha to give S4a1nta1 to him as a
<>foster-daughter. Thus he took away S4a1nta1 to An3ga.
<>Lomapa1da gave S4a1nta1 in marriage to R2s2yas2r2n3ga a
<>hermit. (See under R2s2yas4r2n3ga).
<NI>As Kausalya1 was childless Das4aratha brought as his
<>wife Kaikeyi1 the daughter of the King of Kekaya and
<>sister of Yudha1jit. Still no children were born to them.
<>He was much disappointed. At last he married again and
<>brought Sumitra1 the princess of Ka1s4i. Of these three,
<>Kausalya1 was the chief wife.
<NI>Though he had three wives, Das4aratha still remained
<>childless. The King and his queens spent their days in
<>sorrow for a long time. The King remembered the curse
<>he had incurred when he was young. The curse was
<>that as they had died with sorrow at the death of their
<>son S4ravan2a, the same thing would happen to me.
<>So he believed that sons would be born to him.
<NI>He performed several devotional acts to get children.
<>Finally he gave up all kingly pleasures and began to
<>lead an ascetic life. He built a temple for his own use
<>and consecrated the idol of Maha1vis2n2u in it. Then entrust-
<>ing the administration of the Kingdom to his ministers
<>he and his wives engaged themselves in daily devotion
<>and meditation in the temple. Then the King decided
<>to perform the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i (sacrifice for
<>getting children) by the hermit R2s2yas4r2n3ga under the
<>guidance of Vasis2t2ha. The King informed R2s2yas4r2n3ga
<>of his decision. R2s2yas4r2n3ga could not refuse the King's
<>request as the king was his father-in-law. Moreover
<>Lomapa1da and S4a1nta1 also requested the hermit to com-
<>ply with the desire of Das4aratha. So R2s2yas4r2n3ga came to
<>Ayodhya1 and the sacrifice of Putraka1mes2t2i was begun.
<>The air vibrated with the recitation of mantras (spells and
<>incantations) and the Veda Su1ktas. The hermit uttered
<>the divine spell of Putraka1mes2t2i and offered oblations
<>in the sacrificial fire. Then a wonderful and luminous
<>figure came out of the fire with a pot containing a
<>pudding of ambrosia, and placed the pot before R2s2ya-
<>s2r2n3ga and then disappeared in the sacrificial fire. When
<>the wonderful figure disappeared, R2s2yas4r2n3ga took the
<>pot of pudding and gave it to Das4aratha with prayer and
<>incantations. Das4aratha received the golden pot and in
<>accordance with the instruction of the hermit, divided
<>the pudding between his first wife Kaus4alya1 and second
<>wife Kaikeyi1, both of whom gave half of their share to
<>Sumitra1. Thus the three wives ate the divine pudding
<>and by and by all of them became pregnant. Kaus4alya1
<>and Kaikeyi1 gave birth to a son each and Sumitra1
<>gave birth to two sons. The son of Kaus4alya1 was called
<>Ra1ma, the son of Kaikeyi1 was named Bharata and the [Page205-a+ 65]
<>sons of Sumitra1 were called Laks2man2a and S4atrughna.
<>(Kam3pa Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>10) {%The boon of S4ani (Saturn).%} Astronomers are of
<>opinion that famine will occur in the world for the
<>period of twelve years, when the planet S4ani (Saturn)
<>comes into the orbit of Rohin2i1 (a star). But now the
<>planet Saturn does not come into the orbit of the star
<>Rohin2i1. There is a story in the Padma Pura1n2a, which
<>states that this happened so because of a boon S4ani had
<>given to Das4aratha.
<NI>During the regime of Das4aratha the planet S4ani approa-
<>ched the orbit of Rohin2i1. Experts in astronomy said that
<>the earth would be ruined by famine etc. if S4ani cleft
<>the star Rohin2i1. Hearing this Das4aratha took his bow
<>and arrows, got into his chariot, and started for the
<>firmament. He travelled for one lac and a quarter of
<>yojanas (leagues) and reached the hind part of Rohin2i1,
<>which is beyond the sun. Adorned with golden gar-
<>ments and a golden crown studded with jewels, seated
<>on a golden chariot decorated with precious stones, and a
<>lofty flagpost and yoked with horses of the colour of
<>swan, the king shone in the sky as a second sun. He drew
<>the bow-string right upto his ear and placed in it the
<>arrow of destruction. When the devas and the asuras
<>saw the arrow of destruction they began to tremble with
<>fear. S4ani came to Das4aratha and fell before him and
<>said that he would grant any boon to the King, and
<>requested him to recall the arrow of destruction. Das4a-
<>ratha told S4ani that he only wanted S4ani not to come to
<>the orbit of Rohin2i1. S4ani agreed. From that day onwards
<>S4ani has never entered the orbit of Rohin2i1. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Ka1nd2a, Chapter 34).
<NI>11) {%Death.%} Ra1ma and Laks2man2a with Si1ta1 went to
<>live in the forest. Sumantra who accompanied them
<>up to the river Ganges, returned to the palace. By
<>then Das4aratha had fallen down filled with grief. He
<>had never recovered from that state of unconsciousness.
<>At the time of his death Bharata and S4atrughna had
<>been away in the kingdom of Kekaya and Ra1ma and
<>Laks2man2a in the forest. Thus the curse he incurred
<>in his younger days from the aged hermit, the father of
<>S4ravan2a, was fully realized.
<NI>12) {%Das4aratha appears again.%} Ra1van2a was killed in the
<>battle. Si1ta1 was tested in fire and found sinless. Ra1ma
<>accepted her, seeing that her conjugal fidelity was not
<>marred. At this time S4iva appeared before Ra1ma in a
<>divine aeroplane. Das4aratha was seated in that plane
<>clad in pure garments. He took Ra1ma and Laks2man2a
<>into his lap and embraced them. He blessed them and
<>Si1ta1 who was standing with folded hands. Then Das4a-
<>ratha disappeared. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,
<>Sarga 122).
<HI>DAS4A1RHA. A king of the Yadu family. He was so famous
<>that his descendants were called the Das4a1rhas. As S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a was born as a descendant in the line of Das4a1rha,
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a is sometimes called Da1s4a1rha, in certain places.
<>For genealogy see under Yaduvam3s4a.
<HI>DA1S4A1RHI1 I. A woman belonging to Da1s4a1rha's family.

<HI>DA1S4A1RN2A(M). An ancient country, famous in the
<>Pura1n2as.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} This country had been divided
<>into two, Eastern Das4a1rn2a and Western Das4a1rn2a. The
<>modern Patna and the surrounding places comprised
<>Eastern Das4a1rn2a and the places of Malva, the Western
<>Das4a1rn2a. Some are of opinion that Das4a1rn2a comprises
<>the South-East part of the Vindhya mountain. It is men-
<>tioned in ‘Meghadu1ta’ that Vidis4a1 was the capital of
<>Das4a1rn2a. The modern name of Vidis4a1 is Bhilsa1.

<>born to Vi1raba1hu. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 69).
<NI>(5) Before the battle of Bha1rata, Hiran2yavarma1 was the
<>King of Das4a1rn2a. S4ikhan2d2ini1 the daughter of Drupada
<>went in the guise of a male and married the daughter
<>of Hiran2yavarma1. The king of Das4a1rn2a who had been
<>deceived thus, attacked Drupada. But the problem was
<>solved because S4ikhan2d2ini1 actually became a male. (See
<>the word Am3ba1). (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9,

<HI>DASYU. The ancient dwellers of North India. What
<>we see in R2gveda is mostly a history of the A1ryans from
<>the period of their exodus from the plateau Kumbha
<>till they reached the banks of the Yamuna1. The plateau
<>of Kum3bha is Kabul. The Dasyus were the first people
<>the Aryans had to confront with after passing the Indus.
<>R2gveda bears testimony to the fact that the civilization
<>of the Dasyus was far advanced than that of the A1ryans.
<>S4am3bara, King of the Dasyus, was the ruler of hundred
<>cities. All the cities were fortified with strong walls and
<>fortresses, which are described as ‘as4vamayi1’, ‘a1yasi1’,
<>‘s4atabhuji1’ etc. The greatest enemies of the A1ryans were
<>the ‘Pan2is’ of these cities. They were a particular class
<>of people of these cities. In the ‘Nirukta of Ya1ska’ it is
<>mentioned that pan2is were traders. Names of many of the
<>Kings of the Dasyus occur in the R2gveda. Dhuni,
<>Cumuri, Pipru, Varcas, S4am3bara and such others are the
<>most valiant and mighty among them. The most impor-
<>tant of the several tribes of the Dasyus were the S4imyus,
<>the Ki1kat2as, S4igrus and the Yaks2us. They are mentioned
<>as the Ana1sas in the R2gveda. (Ana1sas--without nose).
<>Perhaps their nose was flat; more over they are stated as
<>having dark complexion. So it may be assumed that the
<>Dasyus were Dravidians. They talked a primitive
<>language, and they despised sacrificial religion. They did
<>not worship Gods like Indra and others. They possibly
<>worshipped the Phallus, S4iva, Devi and the like.

<HI>DATTA1TREYA. (DATTA). A hermit famous in the
<>pura1n2as.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Anasu1ya1, the wife of hermit Atri gave birth
<>to Datta1treya. But Datta1treya was the incarnation of
<>Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>There is a story in Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a how Maha1-
<>vis2n2u came to incarnate as Datta1treya.
<NI>Once there was a hermit called An2ima1n2d2avya (Ma1n2d2a-
<>vya). While the hermit was engaged in silent medi-
<>tation, some robbers passed by that way. The King's
<>men who were chasing the robbers, came to the hermit
<>and asked him about the robbers. The hermit did not
<>break the silence. The King's men, thinking the hermit
<>to be the thief bound his hands and legs and took him to
<>the palace. The King ordered Ma1n2d2avya to be killed by
<>piercing his body with a trident. Accordingly a trident
<>was posted on a hill far away and Ma1n2d2avya was seated [Page206-b+ 64]
<>on the tip of it. Ma1n2d2avya lay there in agony.
<NI>It was at this time that S4i1lavati1, famous for her conjugal
<>fidelity, went to the house of a harlot, carrying her
<>husband Ugras4ravas on her shoulder. When they passed
<>by that way Ugras4ravas scolded An2ima1n2d2avya; getting
<>angry at this An2ima1n2d2avya cursed Ugras4ravas that he
<>would get his head broken and die before the sun-rise.
<>Si1lavati1 became very sorry when she heard the curse
<>and she also cursed. “Let the sun not rise tomorrow”.
<>The sun did not rise next day. Everything in the world
<>was in chaos. The devas were flurried. They went to
<>Brahma1. Brahma1 took them to S4iva. They could not
<>find a solution. So all of them approached Maha1vis2n2u.
<>The Trimu1rtis (three gods) told the devas that the
<>problem would be solved, and the devas returned.
<>Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara went to S4i1lavati1. Before
<>seeing S4i1lavati1, they went to Anasu1ya1 the wife of Atri
<>and sought her help to persuade S4i1lavati1 to recall her
<>curse. Thus Anasu1ya1 and the Trimu1rtis approached
<>S4i1lavati1 and spoke compassionate and consolatory words.
<>At last S4i1lavati1 recalled the curse. The Trimu1rtis con-
<>vinced S4i1lavati1, that Ugras4ravas would not die. The
<>pleased Trimu1rtis asked Anasu1ya1 to ask for any boon. She
<>replied that she did not want any boon except that the
<>Trimu1rtis should take birth as her sons. Accordingly
<>Maha1vis2n2u took birth as Datta1treya, S4iva as Durva1sas
<>and Brahma1 as Candra, in the womb of Anasu1ya1. This
<>is how Datta1treya was born.
<F>1. Datta1treya is known by the name ‘Datta’ also in the Pura1n2as.</F> Datta1treya did penance
<>from his childhood and became a hermit. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 39 to 44).
<NI>2) {%Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and Datta1treya.%} When Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna became King Datta1treya had become very famous.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna wanted to obtain supernatural powers.
<>So he called the hermit Garga and asked for his advice.
<>Garga advised him that Datta1treya was the incarnation
<>of Vis2n2u and that he would grant his wishes. So Ka1rta-
<>vi1rya1rjuna and his wife came to the river Narmada1,
<>and taking bath in the river, began to worship Datta1-
<>treya, who was doing penance closeby. Datta1treya
<>was pleased and went to Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna and asked him
<>what his desire was. He requested for thousand hands
<>and to be a youth for ever, and such other things.
<>Datta1treya granted his wishes. After that Ka1rtavi1rya1r-
<>juna would very often go to the hermit Datta1treya for
<>his advice. (Brahma Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>3) {%Cursing Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a went to the hermit-
<>age of Datta1treya. The hermit had placed a waterpot
<>purified by reciting spells and incantations. Ra1van2a
<>stole that waterpot. When the hermit knew this, he
<>cursed Ra1van2a saying, “Since the water, which was
<>evoked by spells and incantations, has fallen on your
<>head, Monkeys will pollute your head by treading on
<>it.” (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>4) {%Exhortation to the Sa1dhyas.%} Mention is made in Maha1-

<>hermit Datta1treya gave exhortations to the Sa1dhyas (the
<>sons of Dharmadeva by his wife Sa1dhya1).
<NI>5) A boon for the birth of Nahus2a. See Nahus2a.
<HI>DATTOLI. A son born to hermit Pulastya by his wife
<>Pri1ti. This Dattoli was in his previous birth, Agastya of

<HI>DA1YAKRAMA. (INHERITANCE). Da1yakrama is [Page207-a+ 63]
<>the system by which the wealth of parents is received by
<>the heirs. The system of inheritance as described by Manu
<>is as follows:--
<NI>1) After the death of the parents, all the children should
<>divide their wealth among themselves. When either the

<>their wealth.
<NI>2) If the wealth is not divided, the eldest brother should
<>keep the whole of it in his custody and maintain his
<>brothers and sisters like a father.
<NI>3) Of the entire wealth, the eldest brother may take one-
<>twentieth part, the second brother, one-fortieth part
<>and the third brother, one-eghtieth part and the balance
<>is to be divided equally among all of them.

<HI>D2AYA1NA1KS2ETRA. A famous temple of Goddess Diana
<>in Epheseus. In Greek mythology Diana (Daya1na1) is
<>the goddess of hunting. She is also identified with the
<>Moon Goddess. Being a virgin goddess, she came to be
<>worshipped by virgins who regarded her as their patron.
<>Daya1na1 (Diana) is one of the beautiful daughters of the
<>supreme God, Zeus. Her idol was worshipped in many
<>places in Greece. There was a famous temple of this god-
<>dess in the town of Epheseus. This temple was destroyed
<>in the 3rd Century B.C. by enemies.
<HI>DEVA(S). Gods or deities.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} From time immemorial belief in
<>Devas has existed in every country and all religions have
<>lauded their superior nature and power. It was the
<>Hindus and the Buddhists who first applied the term ‘Deva’
<>to certain very subtle beings recognised in all religions.
<>The Pa1rsi religion (Zaratus2t2ra) has spoken about seven
<>Devara1jans and their attendants. ‘Ames2 pentas’ is the
<>actual term used for the Devara1ja. The Christian reli-
<>gion refers to nine sects of Devas like Sra1fi, Kherubi,
<>Dominion, Angel etc. I1slam refers to four chief Devas
<>viz. Gabriel, the presiding Deva over revelations, Mik-
<>hayel of protection, Asriyal of death and Israfin of resur-
<>ruction. An important section of the R2gveda is Su1ktas
<>about Deva1s like Indra, Mitra, Varun2a, Agni etc. In
<>Yajn5as etc. Devas occupy a very important place. The
<>Kenopanis2ad states that the conceited and haughty Devas
<>were taught a lesson by God. The subject matter of the
<>Kat2hopanis2ad is the advice given by Yama to Naciketas.
<>The Mun2d2akopanis2ad says that the Devas, man and
<>birds originated from God.
<F>1. Tasma1cca deva1h2 bahudha1 samprasu1ta1h2 sa1dhya1h2 manus2ya1h2 pas4avo vaya1m3sah2.</F> There are references about
<>Deva worship in the Smr2tis. The Pura1n2as and Upapu- [Page207-b+ 62]
<>ra1n2as contain scientific discussions, about the origin,
<>work or functions, classes, etc. of Devas. The Mantra-
<>s4a1stra and Tantras4a1stra deal also about the various sects
<>and class of Devas, their nature, and the worship to be
<>offered to them etc.
<NI>2) {%Christian Devas, Satan and devils.%} Christian religious
<>books commonly use the term Ma1la1khas for Devas.
<>Greek mythology contains a story about the Ma1la1khas,
<>who did not obey the orders of Jehovah and how He
<>cursed them, turned them into devils and flung them into
<>hell. And, in hell they organised a revolutionary party
<>to fight Jehovah. Many leaders talked on the subject of
<>how to take vengeance on Jehovah. It was nearabout
<>this period that Jehovah created with the dust on earth
<>Adam as his beloved son and settled him in the garden of
<>Aden. God created from the ribs of Adam the woman
<>called Eve, and they lived in Eden quite happily.
<NI>Satan and other leaders in hell decided that the greatest
<>revenge that could be taken upon Jehovah was to create
<>troubles for his dear son, Adam in Eden. Accordingly
<>Satan went to Eden and made Adam and Eve eat the
<>forbidden fruit with the result that Jehovah cursed and
<>turned them into human beings and turned them out of
<>Eden. Milton in his reputed poem Paradise Lost has told
<>the above story in inimitable language.
<NI>3) {%Indian Devas.%} Most of the Indian Devas are the sons
<>of Kas4yapa Praja1pati by Aditi, daughter of Daks2a Praja1-
<>pati. The total number of Devas is 33 crores. The Devas
<>are divided into many classes or sections like A1dityas,
<>Vis4vadevatas, Vasus, Tus2itas, A1bha1svaras, Anilas, Maha1-
<>ra1jikas, Sa1dhyas, Rudras, Vidya1dharas, Pitr2devas etc.
<>There are further divisions like Apsaras, Viru1pa1ks2as,
<>Bhadras, Gandharvas, Kum3bha1n2d2as, Ra1ks2asas, Na1gas,
<>As4vini1s, Kinnaras, Kim3purus2as, Pis4a1cas, Guhyakas,
<>Siddhas, Ca1ran2as, Matr2s, Ku1s4ma1n2d2as, Bhu1tas, Veta1las,
<>etc. Yet another division is into Lokapa1las, Lipikas etc.
<>The Devas are classified with special reference to
<>bhu1tagan2as like Pr2thvi1 etc. and are, therefore, referred
<>to as Bhu1devata1s, Agnidevata1s, Va1yudevata1s, etc. The
<>presiding spirit of Bhu1devata1s is Kubera, that of the
<>Jaladevata1s is Varun2a, that of the Agnidevata1s, Va1yu-
<>bhagava1n and that of the A1ka1s4adevatas, Indra. And,
<>under them there are various sets of Devas in charge of
<>different departments. Sa1dhyas, Vasus, A1dityas, Apsaras
<>etc. are A1ka1s4adevas, Maruttas and Gandharvas,
<>Va1yudevas. Yaks2as and Yaks2i1s are servants of
<>Kubera. Viru1pa1ks2a, Bhadra etc. are Bhu1devas.
<>Viru1pa1ks2a supports the earth according to the Va1lmi1ki
<>Pura1n2a. Those who protect nidhis (treasures) may also
<>be considered Bhu1midevas.
<NI>There are 33 bosses or presiding spirits for the 33 crores
<>of Devas. Dva1das4a1dityas (12) Eka1das4arudras (11)
<>As2t2avasus (8) and As4vini1devas (2) are the 33 chiefs of
<>Devas. Indra is the chief of all of them.
<NI>4) {%The term Deva.%} The word Deva means light and
<>also play. Devas shine forth, they are also playful.
<>Thus the name is quite apt for them. (See Gra1ma-
<>devata1).
<HI>DEVABHA1GA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Bha1ga-
<>vata Navama Skandha).
<HI>DEVABHA1GAS4RAUTA1RS2A. A r2s2i, the son of S4ruta
<>and learned in yajn5as. He had accurate knowledge as to [Page208-a+ 64]
<>which parts of the yajn5a-cow should be distributed to
<>whom, and till death he did not impart this knowledge
<>to anyone. But, sometime afterwards a non-human
<>individual taught the subject to Girija, son of Babhru.
<>(Aitareya Bra1hman2a).
<NI>At the time when the Sr2n5jayas and the Kuru kings were
<>living in amity consequent upon the da1ks2a1yan2a yajn5a
<>it was this Devabha1ga who acted as the priest of both
<>the parties. His theories on Sa1vitra1gni are quoted in
<>Taittiri1ya Bra1hman2a.
<HI>DEVABHRA1T2. An effulgent Devata1 who was the son of
<>Ravi and father of Subhra1t2. (A1di Parva, Chapter 1,
<>Verse 42).
<HI>DEVA1DARS4A. An a1ca1rya in the line of Vya1sa's disciples.
<>He was the disciple of Kabandha, and he had many
<>disciples. Medha1, Brahmabali, Sauta1yana and Pippa-
<>la1da were chief among those disciples. (See genealogy
<>of Gurus).
<HI>DEVADA1RUVANA. A holy centre. A dip in the ti1rtha
<>here is productive of very good results. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 25, Verse 27).
<HI>DEVADA1SA. A rich Vais4ya extolled much in the Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara. He lived in Pa1taliput2ra and had married the
<>daughter of a very rich Vais4ya of Paun2d2ravardhana. After
<>his father's death Devada1sa lost all his wealth in gamb-
<>ling, and his wife foresook her impecunious husband and
<>returned home.
<NI>After roaming about for some time the helpless Devada1sa
<>decided to go to his wife's house, and one mid-night
<>he went there. While hiding himself there in the darkness
<>he heard his wife telling her paramour the following:
<>“In the four corners of Devada1sa's house are hidden
<>four treasures. But he does not know about the treasures
<>hidden thus by one of his fore-fathers. I got the informa-
<>tion from his mother. You should purchase the pro-
<>perty for a small price.”
<NI>No sooner did Devada1sa hear the above than he
<>hurried back to his house and dug up the treasure
<>and thus became wealthy again. The paramour of his
<>wife went to him a few days later and purchased the
<>property at a heavy price. But, when he dug up the
<>place no treasure was found. Then he wanted to sell
<>back the property to Devada1sa himself, but he refused
<>to purchase it. The case was taken before the King when
<>Devada1sa detailed the whole story. And, as ordered by
<>the King, Devada1sa disfigured his wife and wedded
<>another wife. (Katha1saritsa1gara, La1va1n2akalam3bakam,
<>Taran3ga 5).
<HI>DEVADATTA I. A famous brahmin boy whose story is
<>described in the Katha1saritsa1gara.
<NI>Devadatta was the son of the Brahmin, Haridatta of
<>Kambukapura. Though as a boy Devadatta learnt all
<>the arts and sciences when he grew up to be a youth he
<>became a very wayward fellow. Dice-play became his
<>main job. One day in a game of dice he lost even his
<>clothes, and being afraid of his father, he left the place
<>without returning home.
<NI>Devadatta roamed about, and during one such trip
<>he saw a deserted temple, and a muni called Ja1lapa1da
<>engaged in reciting mantras. Devadatta prostrated be-
<>fore the muni and told him all the details about himself.
<>The muni accepted Devadatta as his s4is2ya and promised
<>to secure vidya1dharahood for him.
<NI>Next night Ja1lapa1da led Devadatta to a burning ghat, [Page208-b+ 64]
<>nearby the temple. After conducting Pu1ja1 in the shade
<>of a fig tree with offerings of Pa1yasa and Vais4va-
<>devabali the muni told Devadatta thus: “You should
<>come here daily and perform pu1ja1 like this, and pray
<>at the close of it, ‘Oh! Vidyutprabha1! please accept my
<>pu1ja1.’
<NI>Devadatta acted according to the above advice of the
<>muni, and one day, at the close of his pu1ja1 the tree broke
<>open into two and a beautiful female who appeared from
<>it took him with her saying that her mistress wanted him.
<>He was thus taken to a house studded with gems wherein
<>he saw a noble lady seated on a cot. She caught Deva-
<>datta by his hands and after seating him alongside said
<>to him: “I am Vidyutprabha1, daughter of the Yaks2a
<>king Ratnavars2a. I am a virgin girl. Muni Ja1lapa1da
<>has worshipped me so much that I have decided to
<>fulfil his desire. I am in love with you and you will
<>please wed me.”
<NI>Accordingly Devadatta married Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>there with her. In due course she conceived, and Deva-
<>datta met Ja1lapa1da and told him about the whole
<>affair, and the muni, to achieve his personal object
<>asked Devadatta to cut open the abdomen of Vidyut-
<>prabha1 and take to him the child found therein. Deva-
<>datta did not at all relish the idea. Yet reluctant to
<>disobey his preceptor he returned to his wife. She permit-
<>ted him to carry out the directions of the muni, yet his
<>mind did not approve of the action. Then Vidyutprabha1
<>herself cut open her abdomen, took the child out of it
<>and placing it before her husband told him thus:--
<>“He who eats the child will become a Vidya1dhara.
<>Take it. I was a Vidya1dhari1 turned into a Yaks2i1 by a
<>curse, and to cut open my abdomen and take out the
<>child like this was the redemption promised me from the
<>curse, and now I go to the Vidya1dhara world; we shall
<>meet there.” And she disappeared.
<NI>In great sorrow Devadatta brought the child to Ja1la-
<>pa1da who, after sending him out on the pretext of his
<>(Ja1lapa1da's) performing Bhairavapu1ja, ate up the child.
<>Devadatta returned and when he knew of the action of
<>his preceptor he was overcome with rage. But the latter
<>rose up to the skies assuming the form of a Vidya1dhara.
<>Devadatta made up his mind to anyhow take revenge
<>upon Ja1lapa1da, and he also went to Vidya1dharaloka with
<>the help of a Veta1la whom he befriended by offering
<>human flesh. And, there he saw Ja1lapa1da drunk with
<>pride at his Vidya1dharahood sitting on a throne of
<>gems in a mansion. Meanwhile Vidyutprabha1 who was
<>now once more a Vidya1dhari1 had turned down the
<>advances made by the erstwhile Ja1lapa1da for her love.
<>But, at the sight of Devadatta her face flushed with love
<>for him while, in fear, the sword fell down from the
<>hands of Ja1lapa1da who now fainted. Devadatta pre-
<>vented the Veta1la from killing Ja1lapa1da and he (Veta1la)
<>at the instance of Devadatta took Ja1lapa1da to the burn-
<>ing ghat and cremated him there.
<NI>Ka1tya1yani1devi1 at this time appeared before Devadatta
<>and pleased with his courage appointed him as chief of
<>the Vidya1dharas. He wedded Vidyutprabha1 and lived
<>happily. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Caturda1rika1lam3bakam3,
<>Taran3ga 3).
<HI>DEVADATTA II. A king of ancient India, son of King
<>Jayadatta. Jayadatta wanted to marry his son Devadatta
<>to the daughter of a Vais4ya in Pa1t2ali1putra. Though it [Page209-a+ 65]
<>was a far cry from Pa1t2ali1putra to Jayadatta's court the
<>Vais4ya married his daughter to the prince as he attached
<>much importance to such an alliance with the King.
<>From the dowry given by the Vais4ya to his daughter
<>the resources of her father appeared to be very meagre
<>to Devadatta.
<NI>After some time Devadatta's wife returned to her house
<>with the permission of her husband. During her absence
<>Jayadatta expired, enemies attacked his kingdom and
<>Devadatta with his mother ran away from his kingdom.
<>Sometime after that he started for his wife's house. But,
<>feeling that it would not be proper for him to personally
<>tell his father-in-law about what had happened to him
<>he waited outside an inn near his wife's house, and he
<>had not waited there for long when he saw a woman
<>descending by a cord from the other door of the house.
<>He felt deeply mortified to detect that it was his wife
<>who was thus descending. And, when she, not recognis-
<>ing Devadatta in his dirty clothes, asked him who he
<>was, he answered a ‘traveller’. Taking no notice of this
<>‘traveller’ she got into the inn, and Devadatta followed
<>her. Inside the inn she was met by a man who beat her
<>for being late to go to him; but, in spite of the beating
<>she pleased him with coy words. Then and there Deva-
<>datta divorced her in his mind, but remained there
<>observing their love-making. In the course of their love-
<>play an ear-ring studded with costly gems rolled down
<>the floor from her ears, but she did not notice it. She
<>parted from her paramour before dawn. Devadatta
<>went to Ka1nyakubja with the ear-ring, and there he
<>pledged it for one lakh sovereigns with which money he
<>collected an army and conquered back his lost kingdom.
<>Then he redeemed the pledge and sent the ear-ring to
<>his father-in-law. The whole incident became public.
<>When she realised the fact that the stranger whom she
<>had met at the inn was her own husband, Devadatta's
<>wife felt so deeply hurt and humiliated that her heart was
<>broken and she died. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Narava1hana-
<>datta Janana, Taran3ga 1).
<HI>DEVADATTA III. Father of the reputed muni Utatthya.
<>(Satyatapas). (See Satyatapas.)
<HI>DEVADATTA(M). The divine conch of Arjuna. Maya
<>got this conch from Varun2a and he kept it in the sabha1
<>of Vr2s2aparvan, which was in Bindusaras on Mount
<>Maina1ka to the south of Mount Kaila1sa. When Maya
<>built the palace at Indraprastha for the Pa1n2d2avas he
<>went to Bindusaras and brought for Arjuna that conch
<>called Devadattam, and a club for Bhi1masena. (Sabha1
<>Parva, Chapter 3).
<NI>In the battle of Kuruks2etra Arjuna mounted a white
<>horse and blew his conch Devadattam. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 25, Verse 14).
<HI>DEVA1DHIPA. A king who in his previous life was an
<>asura. (A1di Parva, Chapter 67, Verse 26).
<HI>DEVADU1TA. A messenger of the Devas. When Dharma-
<>putra refused to live in heaven without his brothers
<>like Karn2a it was this Devadu1ta with whom Indra sent
<>Dharmaputra to Karn2a and others. (M.B. Svarga1-
<>rohan2a Parva, Chapter 2, Verse 14). This Devadu1ta
<>is to be meditated upon at dawn and before sun-set
<>everyday. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 165, Verse 14).
<HI>DEVADYUMNA. A king of the dynasty of Bharata.
<>From Bharata, son of R2s2abha, was born Sumati, from
<>Sumati Devajit and from him Devadyumna was born.
<>Devadyumna was the grand-father of King Prati1pa and [Page209-b+ 65]
<>father of King Parames2t2hi. (Bha1gavata Pan5cama
<>Skandha).
<HI>DEVADYUTI. A R2s2i who dwelt in his a1s4rama on the
<>banks of river S4arasvati1. Owing to the blessing of Vis2n2u
<>a son called Sumitra was born to him. As a result of his
<>doing rigorous tapas for 1000 years he shone with a
<>rare effulgence. Though Vis2n2u appeared to him one
<>day in the month of Vais4a1kha and asked him to choose
<>any boon he wanted, he, who was so much detached in
<>life prayed only for devotion to God. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 212).
<HI>DEVAGAN2A. See Manvantara.
<HI>DEVAGARBHA. A R2s2i. He too was present as one of
<>the hotr2s (Priests) at the yajn5a conducted by Brahma1
<>at the Pus2kara temple. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 34).

<>(Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 7).
<HI>DEVAHOTRA. A mahars2i, who was an honoured

<>Mount Ka1lan5jara. A dip in its holy waters will bring the
<>same result as the da1na (gift) of a thousand cows.
<>(Vana Parva, Chapter 85, Verse 56).
<HI>DEVAHU1TI1. A daughter of Sva1yambhuva Manu, the
<>son of Brahma1. The Manu had two sons called Priya-
<>vrata and Utta1napa1da and three daughters named
<>A1ku1ti, Devahu1ti and Prasu1ti. A1ku1ti was married by
<>Rucipraja1pati and Devahu1ti by Kardamapraja1pati
<>and Prasu1ti to Daks2praja1pati. Kapila, the mighty
<>exponent of the Sa1n3khya system of philosophy and great
<>ascetic was the son born to Kardama by Devahu1ti.
<>Kapila taught his mother the world famous Kapila
<>S4a1stra, (Devibha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha) and when the
<>teaching was over he bade farewell to her and took to
<>forest life. And, his mother performed a yajn5a on the
<>lines advised by her son, on the banks of river Sarasvati1.
<>Because she took three baths daily her hairs became a
<>mixture of black and blue in colour and she got emacia-
<>ted due to fasting. She wore the bark of trees. Deva-
<>hu1ti, who realised all the principles and the truth be-
<>came blind to all external objects like gardens, maids,
<>mansions etc. Thus immersed in meditation she in
<>course of time attained siddhi (realisation). The parti-
<>cular spot on the banks of Sarasvati1 where she attained
<>Siddhi is called Siddhapada.
<HI>DEVA1HVAYA. A king in ancient India. (A1di Parva,

<>Parva, Southern Text, Chapter 22).
<HI>DEVAKA II. A king in ancient India. He fostered a

<>Devaki1. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was their eighth child. Six sons of

<>(corners) dominated by Agni, Nirr2ti, Va1yu and I1s4a1na

<>corner and S4ivalin3ga in the I1s4a1na corner. Lin3ga in the
<>form of Rudra should also be installed in the I1s4a1na

<>zones. In that case Va1sudevamu1rti should be installed at
<>the centre. All the Devas bearing the name Ra1ma
<>must be installed to the east of the Pra1sa1da. Lokapa1la-
<>kas like Indra should be installed at the eight places
<>starting with the east. In Pan5ca1yatana pratis2t2ha1 Puru-

<>of earth, sandalwood and of flowers are meant only for
<>temporary use, but they also grant all the desires of the
<>devotees.
<NI>Stone for idols should be got from mountains. Pa1n2d2ura
<>(white), Arun2a (red), Pi1ta (yellow) and Kr2s2n2a (black)-
<>rocks having any one of these four colours may be
<>selected. If no such stone is available any other stone
<>may be used, but by doing homa and reciting Narasim3ha
<>mantra the attributes of any of the specified varn2as
<>should be transferred to it. It is best to have white
<>markings on the stone selected for the idol. There are
<>the three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter with
<>reference to stones. Stone which produces the sound of
<>bell metal on being hit and gives out sparks of fire on
<>being cut is of the masculine gender. Stone which
<>possesses these attributes to a lesser degree is of the
<>feminine gender. Stone with no shape is of neuter gen-
<>der. Beside these three varieties there are the sagarbha
<>(pregnant) stones also, viz. stones with round markings
<>on them, and they should not be used for making idols.
<>Once it is decided to make an idol, Vanayajn5a should
<>be performed first. To worship the forest from which
<>the stone for the idol was to be obtained is vanayajn5a.
<>A specified place in the forest should be dug up, the
<>pit treated with cow-dung and a small platform raised
<>and Vis2n2u worshipped thereon. After sacrificial offerings
<>etc. instruments for the construction of the idol like
<>t2an3ka (chisel) should be worshipped. To sprinkle on
<>the stone s4a1litoya (water in which paddy grains are
<>put) purified with the chanting of astramantra is the
<>next step. After that bhu1tabali (offerings to the spirits
<>of the stone) should be performed upon which the
<>bhu1tas residing inside the stone will quit. Then the
<>a1ca1rya should go to sleep repeating the svapna mantra.

<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 II. A Brahmin, an erudite scholar in the
<>Vedas. His story was once told to Pa1rvati1 by S4iva as
<>follows:--
<NI>Devas4arman, the very erudite brahmin scholar in the
<>Vedas came to be much respected by the people of the
<>four varn2as (Castes) because of his constant and unfail-
<>ing performance of the various religious duties and
<>rites like the Agnihotra etc. He had sons, relations and
<>cows in abundance. But, he did not observe the s4ukla-
<>pan5cami1 in Pros2t2hapada (Bha1drapada) which is one of [Page212-b+ 65]
<>the dva1das4aca1ndra ma1sas (the 12 solar months).
<>That day was his father's death anniversary (S4ra1ddha
<>day) for which he would invite Brahmins on the pre-
<>vious evening. And, in the morning he would get cook-
<>ed rice by his wife in 18 different ways for the gratifica-
<>tion of the departed soul. Then will he feed the
<>Bra1hmins. On one such day he duly treated a Bra1hmin
<>versed in the Vedas. In the evening when he
<>was washing his feet with water brought by his wife
<>he heard the following conversation between a dog
<>and an ox.
<NI>{%Dog :%}--Please attend to my words about what my
<>daughter-in-law did. One day, as fate would have it,
<>I went to my son's house, where a snake was drinking
<>milk, and I drank the whole of the milk which was left
<>over by it. My daughter-in-law saw me drinking it and
<>I was absolutely crest-fallen. I don't feel any yearning
<>even for food.
<NI>{%Ox :%}--Now dog, please attend to my sorrow and grief.
<>Today my son feasted the Brahmins, but he did not even
<>think of me. Nobody gave me even a blade of grass or
<>a drop of water. I have not tasted anything today.
<>Moreover I am a captive also. All this must be the result
<>of some sin committed by me in my past life; no doubt
<>about it.”
<NI>The very learned and intelligent brahmin inferred from
<>the above talk that the dog and ox were his mother and
<>his father respectively. He thought to himself: they have
<>been born as animals in my house. What remedy shall
<>I find out therefor?
<NI>On account of such painful thoughts the Brahmin could
<>not sleep in the night. Early in the morning he went
<>to sage Vasis2t2ha and unburdened his heart to him and
<>requested him to find a solution to the low and mean
<>birth which had become his parents’ fate. After medita-
<>ting for some time the great sage told the brahmin as
<>follows:--
<NI>“Look here, the ox was, in its previous birth, a great
<>brahmin in Kun2d2inanagara. He did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada, the day
<>being the death anniversary of his father. His wife had
<>menstruation on the same day, but she herself feasted
<>the Brahmins. A woman is impure during the four days
<>of menstruation. Because of having feasted the Brah-
<>mins on the first day of her monthly period the Brah-
<>min's wife was born as a dog. As for the husband, he
<>was born an ox as he not only did not observe the
<>S4ukla-pan5cami1 day, but also shared the sin of his wife.
<>Further questioned by the brahmin as to what he should
<>do for the salvation of his parents, Vasis2t2ha advised him
<>to observe the R2s2i pan5cami1 in the month of Pros2t2hapada
<>(Bha1drapada). He did so and his parents blessed him
<>and attained salvation. (Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 78).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 III. (See Mitrabheda).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 IV. The hero of a story told by Vis2n2u-
<>s4arman.
<NI>Vis2n2us4arman, the intelligent preceptor, told five stories
<>based on five tactics to educate the five dull sons of
<>emperor Sudars4ana. The fifth tactics is called asam3prek-
<>s2yaka1ritva. He told two important stories to illustrate
<>the dangers, which would happen to those who act in
<>haste and in anger, without patiently attempting to
<>find out the truth. Devas4arman is the hero of one of
<>the stories.
<NI>{%Story one.%} Once upon a time there lived in Gaud2ades4a [Page213-a+ 65]
<>a brahmin called Devas4arman with his wife Yajn5asena1.
<>When his wife got pregnant Devas4arman told her that a
<>good and lucky son would be born to them to which she
<>replied as follows:--“On no account build castles in
<>the air and brood over things. I shall tell you a story
<>about a danger which happened to one who built
<>castles in the air. A brahmaca1ri1 was carrying home in
<>a pot on his head some rice flour. On the way he
<>thought thus: “I will purchase a she-goat with the
<>money I get out of the sale of this rice powder, and
<>it will deliver two kids every year. I will sell all the
<>kids and with the sale proceeds purchase a cow and
<>when it multiplies I will have the wherewithals for cul-
<>tivation and then I will do cultivation in a good field
<>and produce much paddy. And when I have thus money
<>in hand I will renovate my house and marry. We will
<>then have a good son whom I will name Somas4arman,
<>and if my wife, without caring for the boy, goes to milk
<>the cow I will go to the cow shed and give her a good
<>beating. “When his imagination reached this point the
<>pot on his head received, without his knowing, a blow
<>with the stick in his hand and it fell down on the ground
<>and was broken to pieces.”
<NI>Five or six days after telling the above story to her
<>husband Yajn5asena1 gave birth to a child. One day she
<>went to the river to take her bath leaving the child
<>to the care of her husband. Soon after a messenger came
<>from the palace to invite Devas4arman for food, the day
<>being Ama1vasi1 when Brahmins were fed well and also
<>given daks2in2a1, (presents of money). He could not wait
<>till his wife arrived; the child became a problem to
<>him.
<NI>The brahmin had a beloved Mongoose. After entrusting
<>the child to the care of it the Brahmin went to the
<>palace. Within a short time a serpent was seen crawling
<>towards the child and the Mongoose attacked it and
<>bit it into pieces. Naturally the Mongoose got itself
<>smeared all over with the blood of the serpent, and the
<>brahmin on returning home finding the Mongoose bath-
<>ed in blood thought it might have eaten the child
<>and in a rage he killed the poor Mongoose. But, when
<>he entered the room and found pieces of the killed ser-
<>pent strayed all over there truth and light dawned on
<>him. Yajn5asena1, who had returned after bath by now
<>also found fault with him.
<NI>{%The second story.%} Once there was a Brahmin in very indi-
<>gent circumstances. He was an orphan from his very
<>childhood. One day while he was asleep quite weary
<>and tired as he had no food that day some one
<>appeared and told him in a dream that three sannya1sins
<>would come to his house that noon and that if beaten to
<>death they would turn into three pot-fulls of treasure
<>with which he could live comfortably well.
<NI>His dream came true, and he locked up the treasure in
<>his room after sending away a barber who had witnessed
<>the incident with a piece of gold. The barber returned
<>home cherishing in his mind the false belief that sann-
<>ya1sins beaten to death would turn into pot-fulls of
<>treasure. And, one day some sannya1sins came to his
<>house and he began beating them and they ran out
<>crying aloud. Their cries attracted the attention of the
<>servants of the King. The barber's limbs were cut off
<>and he was killed on S4u1la (a three-pronged weapon).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 V. A Brahmin, who used to perform rites
<>for the dead at the confluence of the sea every fortnight. [Page213-b+ 65]
<NI>On every such occasion souls of the departed used to ap-
<>pear and bless him. Once Devas4arman went to Pitr2loka
<>with his pitr2s, and he got restless and sorry to find other
<>pitr2s living there in greater comfort than the pitr2s of
<>his parents. When he was told that the better fate of
<>the other pitr2s was due to their sons performing S4ra1ddha
<>at Mahi1sa1garasan3gama he returned to earth and with the
<>help of other people did S4ra1ddha at the san3gamaand
<>thus raised the condition of his pitr2s. (Skandha Pura1n2a.
<>Skandhas 1, 2 and 3).
<HI>DEVAS4ARMA1 VI. A Brahmin who lived on the nor-
<>thern side of river Ka1veri1. The following story about
<>him is told in chapters 2, 4 and 12 of the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a.
<NI>One day in the month of Ka1rttika he asked his son to
<>bathe. The son refused to obey his father, who got
<>angry at the disobedience of the son and cursed him to be
<>turned into a rat. But, when the son begged his pardon
<>he said that the boy would resume his old form when
<>he heard about the greatness of Ka1rttika.
<NI>While the Brahmin, thus turned into rat, was roaming
<>about in the forest it saw Vis4va1mitra mahars2i seated
<>under a tree with his disciples. The mahars2i was telling
<>the disciples about the greatness of Ka1rttika. The Brah-
<>min boy--turned cat--heard the story and reverted to
<>its old form as the Brahmin boy.

<HI>DEVASENA. II. Husband of Ki1rtisena1. (See Ki1rtisena1).
<HI>DEVASENA1. Daks2a's daughter and wife of Subrah-
<>man2ya and a woman of rare beauty and purity. Dait-
<>yasena1 and Devasena1, daughters of Daks2a, used to
<>enjoy themselves at Ma1nasa saras. One day Kes4i1, the
<>asura saw them and craved for their love. Daityasena1
<>agreed to become his wife, but Devasena1 refused, and
<>she prayed for the help of Indra, who happened to
<>come there at the moment. Indra and Kes4i1 fought
<>with each other. Kes4i1 used the club against Indra, who
<>broke it into two with his vajra1yudha. Then Kes4i1 hurled
<>a mountain at Indra, who cut it also. Frightened to
<>death Kes4i1 then ran away with Daityasena1 to safety,
<>and Devasena1 expressed her desire to Indra to have
<>one who could defeat the Devas, Da1navas and Yaks2as
<>as her husband. But, Indra could not find such a one
<>in the whole universe. Indra told Brahma1 about it.
<>The Devas put their heads together and brought forth
<>Subrahman2ya from S4iva to be her husband. In the
<>war between the Devas and the asuras Devasena1 helped
<>Subrahman2ya, and the asuras were completely destro-
<>yed. (Vana Parva, Chapters 223, 224).
<HI>DEVAS4I1LA1. See Gaya1ti1rtha.
<HI>DEVASMITA1. A Gem of a woman who was much devoted
<>to her husband. The story of Devasmita1 has been so
<>often quoted in ancient Indian literature. She was the
<>daughter of a Vais4ya called Dharmagupta and was
<>married to Guhasena, son of a Vais4ya called Dhana-
<>datta, who belonged to Ta1mraliptinagara.
<NI>After the death of his father Guhasena decided to go to
<>Kat2a1hadvi1pa for trade, and Devasmita1, a very suspici-
<>ous wife, objected to it. When his other relations began
<>pressing him to go to the dvi1pa for trade and his wife
<>not to go, Guhasena could not take a decision on the [Page214-a+ 65]
<>matter. He began a penance so that God might take
<>the decision in the matter. Devasmita1 also followed
<>him. Then God appeared to them in their dreams
<>and gave each of them a red lotus flower saying, “both
<>of you keep one flower each with you, and while both
<>of you are away from each other if either of you go
<>astray the lotus flower in the hands of the other
<>person will fade.” And, on awaking both of them had
<>a flower in their hands. Guhasena with his flower in
<>his hands started for Kat2a1hadvi1pa, and Devasmita1 sta-
<>yed at home with her eyes fixed on her lotus flower.
<>Guhasena reached the dvi1pa and traded in gems. Every-
<>body was surprised to find in his hands a lotus flower
<>which never faded. Four Vais4ya youngsters wanted to
<>understand the secret of it and one day they invited
<>Guhasena to their house and treated him to liquor very
<>liberally. When he got absolutely drunk they question-
<>ed him about the secret of the lotus flower, and he,
<>though in indistinct words, explained it to them. When
<>the secret was thus out all the four youngsters decided
<>to seduce his wife. They extracted from him the infor-
<>mation that he was not returning in the near future,
<>and they then came to Ta1mralipti.
<NI>At that time there lived in Ta1mralipti a bogus Sannya1-
<>sini1 (a female anchorite) called Yogakaran2d2ika1. The four
<>youths from Kat2a1hadvi1pa visited her, and she under-
<>took to fulfil their desire. She asked them to halt at her
<>house and then went to Devasmita1 with some refreshments.
<>Devasmita1's bitch barked very violently at the bogus an-
<>chorite when she told the former thus:--“Child! don't
<>you see the bitch barking at my very sight. The bitch is
<>crying thinking of her previous birth at my sight. Her-
<>self (the bitch) and I were, in our last birth, the wives
<>of a Brahmin. Since our husband was a courtier at the
<>palace often he was away from home and in his absence
<>I used to satisfy the cravings of sex by associating freely
<>with other males. I had even at that time realised the
<>truth that there was no duty higher than satisfying the
<>senses, and so I am now reborn with memories of the
<>past life. As for this bitch in her past life as co-wife with
<>me of the Brahmin, she sinned against her sense-organs
<>by upholding, in ignorance, her chastity, as a punish-
<>ment for which she was born as dog in this life. Yet, she
<>remembers her past.
<NI>Though Devasmita1 saw through the false and trea-
<>cherous heart of the bogus anchorite, without expres-
<>sing it she talked in all respect with her. Believing that
<>she had succeeded in her mission she told Devasmita1
<>about the four youths who had come from Kat2a1ha-
<>dvi1pa, and Devasmita1 welcomed the idea very gladly.
<NI>Devasmita1 got some liquor and mixed poison in it.
<>When it was night one of the Vais4ya youths came, and
<>after rendering him unconscious by administering the
<>poisoned liquor to him Devasmita1 stripped him of all
<>his clothes and ornaments, got him scratched on the
<>brows by the bitch and threw him into a cow dung
<>heap. Before it was dawn next day he returned to the
<>anchorite's house, took a bath and dressed himself up in
<>decent clothings. His other three companions also visi-
<>ted Devasmita1 one after the other in the next three
<>days, and they too underwent the same experience as the
<>first one. Lastly the bogus sannya1sini1 also was got down
<>and Devasmita1 cut her limbs and sent her away. And,
<>after this Devasmita1 put on the garb of a merchant and
<>went to Kat2a1hadvi1pa and identified her husband from [Page214-b+ 65]
<>among a thousand merchants. Guhasena too felt his
<>own doubts about her identity. But, without revealing
<>her identity she saw the king and told him that she had
<>certain matters to submit before the praja1paris2at (popu-
<>lar assembly). The King accordingly convened a session
<>of the assembly and Devasmita1 identified the four youths
<>who had tried to seduce her and submitted all details
<>regarding the episode. The King then gave her a lot of
<>money, appointed the four youths as her servants and
<>sent her back home with Guhasena. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Katha1mukhalam3bakam, Taran3ga 5).
<HI>DEVAS4RAVAS I A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Bha1-

<HI>DEVAS4RAVAS II A R2s2i born in Vis4va1mitra's family.
<>He was a ma1ntrika of the Kus4ika gotra (S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 47, Verse 5).
<HI>DEVAS4RUTA. A son of S4ukamuni. S4uka, the son of
<>Vya1sa married Pi1vari1, the beautiful daughter of the
<>Pitr2s, and to them were born four sons, Kr2s2na, Gaura-
<>prabha, Bhu1ri and Devas4ruta, and one daughter, Ki1rti.
<>(Devi1bha1gavata, Prathama Skandha).
<HI>DEVASTHA1NA.
<NI>{%General.%} A mahars2i, who was a friend of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>{%Other information.%} (1) After the great war was over this muni
<>visited Dharmaputra and induced him to perform yajn5as.
<NI>(2) Along with some other munis he gave spiritual

<HI>DEVA1SURAYUDDHA(S) Wars between the gods and
<>asuras. Altogether twelve wars were fought between
<>the Devas and the asuras, viz. Narasim3ha, Va1mana,
<>Vara1ha, Amr2tamathana, Ta1raka1maya, A1d2i1baka, Trai-
<>pura, Andhaka, Vadha, Vr2travadha, Dhvajapa1ta,
<>Ha1la1hala and Kola1hala. Hiran2yakas4ipu, the daitya
<>was killed by Narasim3ha. Va1mana took Maha1bali
<>captive after measuring the three worlds in one stride.
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a was killed in fighting in the sea by Vara1ha
<>with its tusks. Indra defeated Prahla1da and in the
<>Ta1raka1maya war also killed his son Virocana who had
<>planned to kill him (Indra). As the Devas could not
<>kill the da1navas of Tripura, Trilocana killed them.
<>Vr2tra who was aided by the da1navas was killed by
<>Indra with the help of Vis2n2u. Indra himself killed
<>Vipracitti and his followers who became invisible by
<>ma1ya1 after the felling of the dhvaja (flag staff), and in
<>the course of celebrating their victory the Devas defeat-
<>ed S4an2d2a1marka at the yajn5a1vabhr2tha (Bathing at the
<>close of the yajn5a). Thus were waged twelve wars
<>between the Devas and the Asuras. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Part 4, Chapter 13).

<>Skandha).
<HI>DEVAVRATA I. Bhi1s2ma (See Bhi1s2ma for details).
<HI>DEVAVRATA II. A brahmin who believed in yajn5as.
<>He once received without due regard and with indif-
<>ference the ti1rtha water given to him by a devotee of
<>Kr2s2n2a after worship of the Lord, as a result of which,
<>in the next birth, he was born as a bamboo stem. And,
<>as he did, consciously or otherwise some good deeds S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a made a flute out of that bamboo stem, and
<>Devavrata thus attained redemption. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Pa1ta1la Khan2d2a, Chapter 73).
<HI>DEVA1VR2DHA I. A warrior, who fought against the

<HI>DEVAYA1NI1. Sukra1ca1rya's daughter.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Sva1yambhuvamanu, son of Brahma1 had two
<>sons: Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da. Priyavrata wedded
<>Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1, two very beautiful daughters
<>of Vis4vakarmapraja1pati, and he had by Suru1pa1 ten
<>sons called Agni1dhra, Idhmajihva1, Yajn5aba1hu,
<>Maha1vi1ra, Rukmasukra, Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1-
<>tithi, Vi1tihotra and Kavi as also a daughter called
<>U1rjasvati1 who was the youngest of the whole lot. Of
<>the above ten sons Kavi, Savana and Maha1vi1ra were
<>spiritual giants and great sages. Uttama, Ta1pasa and
<>Raivata, the three sons of Priyavrata by his second wife
<>Barhis2mati1 turned out to be manvantara1dhipatis.
<>U1rjasvati1, the only daughter of Priyavrata was married
<>to S4ukra1ca1rya, preceptor of the asuras. Devaya1ni1 was
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's daughter by U1rjasvati1. (Devi1bha1gavata,
<>As2t2ama Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Curse by Kaca.%} Kaca, son of Br2haspati became
<>S4ukra1ca1rya's disciple to learn Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 vidya1
<>(the science to ward off death for ever). Devaya1ni1
<>fell madly in love with Kaca. But, after his studies
<>under her father were over Kaca returned to devaloka
<>without marrying Devaya1ni1, who cursed that Kaca's [Page215-b+ 65]
<>learning should prove useless. And, Kaca cursed her
<>in return that nobody from devaloka should marry
<>her. (For details see Kaca).
<NI>3) {%Devaya1ni1 in a neglected well.%} Once Vr2s2aparvan was the
<>king of the asuras, and S4ukra1ca1rya lived in his palace.
<>S4armis2t2ha1, the daughter of the king and Devaya1ni1, the
<>daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya became thick friends. While
<>one day these two friends with their companions were
<>engaged in water sports Indra came that way. Very
<>much interested in seeing the deva damsels thus engaged
<>in water sports Indra assumed the form of air and blew
<>off the dresses of the damsels from the shore while they
<>were playing in the river. The damsels hurriedly got
<>out of water, ran after the fleeing garments and put
<>on whatever came to their hands. In the confusion what
<>S4armis2t2ha1 got and wore was Devaya1ni1's clothes. Devaya1ni1
<>ran after S4armis2t2ha1 and caught hold of the clothes, but
<>the latter did not yield them to her. Both of them
<>indulged in hot words against each other, S4armis2t2ha1
<>calling S4ukra1ca1rya a beggar living in her father's
<>palace for his food. Not only that, she pushed Devaya1ni1
<>into a neglected well and went her way.
<NI>At that time prince Yaya1ti, son of Nahus2a, was hunting
<>in that forest. Feeling very thirsty he came to the well
<>for a drink and therein saw Devaya1ni1 in tears. He
<>brought her out from the well and leaving her there
<>went on his way.
<NI>S4ukra1ca1rya and his wife actually got anxious and upset
<>that their daughter had not returned even after the
<>lapse of so much time and deputed their servant
<>Gurn2ika1 to seek for Devaya1ni1. She found her out in
<>the forest. But, Devaya1ni1 refused to return home as
<>she did not want to continue as the daughter of one
<>who lived on the charity of S4armis2t2ha1 and her father.
<>Gurn2ika1 carried back this news to S4ukra1ca1rya, who then
<>went himself to the forest and met his daughter. He
<>felt deeply wounded to hear about the insults heaped
<>on his daughter by S4armis2t2ha1, and sent word to
<>Vr2s2aparvan that they were not returning to the palace.
<>Vr2s2aparvan realised that if S4ukra1ca1rya quarrelled
<>with him the whole asura world also would become
<>divided. He, therefore, tried his best to pacify the
<>a1ca1rya and his daughter. At last Devaya1ni1 agreed to re-
<>turn to the palace in case S4armis2t2ha1 went to her with one
<>thousand of her maids to serve as her (Devaya1ni1's) maids.
<>Vr2s2aparvan acted accordingly and Devaya1ni1 was
<>satisfied and returned to the palace with her father.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 78 onwards.)
<NI>4) {%Wedding of Devaya1ni1.%} Some time afterwards when
<>Devaya1ni1 was sporting in the forest with S4armis2t2ha1 and
<>others, King Yaya1ti happened to pass that way. They
<>recognised each other and Devaya1ni1 requested Yaya1ti
<>to marry her as she had mentally chosen him as her
<>husband on the very same day on which he had saved
<>her from the well.
<NI>Yaya1ti realised only too well that it was really danger-
<>ous to marry the daughter of S4ukra1ca1rya in the forest
<>secretly and he, therefore, rejected Devaya1ni1's request.
<>But, she got down her father there and with his per-
<>mission Yaya1ti married her. He also got much wealth
<>by way of dowry. S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids accompanied
<>Devaya1ni1 but Sukra1ca1rya warned Yaya1ti that on no
<>account should he touch S4armis2t2ha1.
<NI>With his wife and her attendants Yaya1ti returned to
<>his palace; but he put S4armis2t2ha1 and her maids in [Page216-a+ 70]
<>a place newly built for the purpose. Devaya1ni1 delivered
<>a child in due course and it was named Yadu. S4armis2-
<>t2ha1 one day met Yaya1ti in the forest and requested
<>for a child by him. Though at first he was reluctant to
<>oblige remembering only too well the injunction of
<>S4ukra1ca1rya, he at last succumbed to the eloquence of
<>S4armis2t2ha1. She got pregnant by him and the child
<>she delivered was called Druhyu.
<NI>Devaya1ni1 was alarmed at the birth of a child to
<>S4armis2t2ha, who was unmarried, and questioned her
<>about it. S4armis2t2ha1's answer that a brahmin stranger,
<>who came that way was the father of her child satisfied
<>Devaya1ni1.
<NI>Ere long another son, Turvasu, was born to Devaya1ni1,
<>and S4armis2t2ha1 too delivered two children called
<>Anudruhyu and Pu1ru. Thus the mistress (Devaya1ni1)
<>had two sons and her servant, S4armis2t2ha1 three sons.
<NI>While Yaya1ti and Devaya1ni1 were one day strolling in
<>the garden the sons of S4armis2t2ha1 came there. She
<>noticed the close resemblance of those boys to her
<>husband (Yaya1ti) and it kindled her wrath. Though
<>Yaya1ti did not, because of the presence of Devaya1ni1,
<>notice the children, when she asked them who their
<>father was, they answered “Yaya1ti”, whereupon in
<>great rage she ran up to her father. Yaya1ti too followed
<>her. Devaya1ni1 told her father about the infidelity of
<>Yaya1ti and he (S4ukra) cursed that Yaya1ti be afflicted
<>with old age. When Yaya1ti asked for redumption from
<>the curse S4ukra1ca1rya told him that he could exchange
<>his old age for the youth of somebody else.
<NI>Yaya1ti then called together all his five sons and asked
<>them whether anyone of them was prepared to exchange
<>his (son's) youth for his (Yaya1ti's) old age for one
<>thousand years. The three elder sons refused to agree
<>to the proposal, but the fourth son Pu1ru gladly exchan-
<>ged his youth with his father's old age. After spending
<>his life in youthful enjoyment for one thousand
<>years Yaya1ti returned his youth to Pu1ru, and Pu1ru
<>assumed Kingship of the country. (A1di Parva, Chapters
<>81-83).
<NI>5) {%Synonyms for Devaya1ni1.%} Aus4anasi1, S4ukratanaya1 and
<>Bha1rgavi1.
<HI>DEVI1. (Maha1ma1ya1). Though Devi1 is without a beginn-
<>ing it is told how she became first visible to living beings.
<NI>1) {%Beginning:%} While Maha1vis2n2u was resting on a fig
<>leaf in the assumed form of a child he began thinking
<>as to who he was, who created him and how he should
<>act. And then a celestial voice announced as follows:
<NI>Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham
<NI>Na1nyadasti sana1tanam.
<NI>(All that is, I am. There is nothing eternal but me.).
<>This declaration astonished Vis2n2u, but he could not
<>understand who made it. While he was meditating
<>upon it, Devi1 appeared to him in the following manner.
<>Devi1

<>of shame), Jr2mbha1 and Tandra1 (laziness).
<NI>And, the Devi1 spoke to Maha1vis2n2u as follows:--After
<>all, what is there to be wondered at. Whenever the
<>world faced the phenomenon of Sr2s2t2isthitilaya (crea-
<>tion, existence and absorption into the primordial force)
<>you too have come up due to the power of Maha1s4akti.
<>As for Para1s4akti (the ultimate, universal force) it is
<>above and beyond all attributes. We, all of us, possess
<>attributes. From the na1bhi (navel) of yourself in whom
<>sattvagun2a (gentle attributes) predominates will be
<>born Brahma1 in whom rajogun2a (active attributes)
<>will predominate, and from the centre of his brows
<>will be born Rudra with tamogun2a (black, destructive
<>attributes). Brahma1, by the force of his tapas will earn
<>powers of creation and will with his rajogun2a create
<>the world blood-red in colour, and you will be the
<>sustainer and guardian of that world. The very same
<>world will be annihilated by Rudra at the end of the
<>Kalpa era. You please do know that I am the sa1ttvic
<>force which depend on you for the purpose of creation.
<>All creations of worlds have been made according to
<>the suggestions of Devi1.
<NI>2) {%Origin of Devi1.%} Once King Janamejaya questioned
<>Vya1sa about the birth of Devi1 to which he replied as
<>follows:--
<NI>Even Brahma1vis2n2umahes4varas (Brahma1, Vis2n2u and
<>S4iva--the Hindu trinity) are not capable of thinking
<>about the origin of Devi1. Then, what about me? Yet
<>let me make an attempt. All the forces--everything--
<>which appear in various names and forms are in fact
<>Devi1 herself, her different manifestations. Just as a
<>master actor appears on the stage in different roles for
<>the delectation of the audience the formless Devi1, on
<>behalf of the Devas, assumes many forms and imposes
<>upon herself attributes though in fact she is without any
<>attribute whatsoever. Thus, depending on her various
<>forms, actions etc. she is addressed by different names.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Pan5cama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Five forms of Devi1.%} When primordial nature (Mu1la-
<>prakr2ti) incarnated or manifested in the form of Vis2n2u
<>the desire for creation raised its head in him. And, at
<>once the Devi1--female--aspects in Vis2n2u manifested
<>in five forms like Durga1, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1, Sa1vitri1 and
<>Ra1dha1. These five forms are designated as the
<>Pan5cadevi1s. Brief notes on the five Devi1s are given
<>below.
<NI>(1) {%Durga1devi1.%} Mother of Gan2es4a bhagava1n. (God with
<>the elephant's head). She is the consort of S4iva.
<>Na1ra1yan2i1, the Vis2n2uma1ya1, is none else than Durga1.
<>She is also perfect Brahma, the one and the only one
<>with no second to it. She is worshipped by Devas like
<>Brahma1 and by sages and mahars2is. She is the basis,
<>the root and root cause of everything. She is eternal,
<>upholder of dharma, truth itself and the giver and
<>promoter of happiness, reputation, welfare, salvation
<>etc. as also of sorrow, grief, pain etc. She takes great [Page217-a+ 64]
<>preasure in removing the worries and sorrows of devo-
<>tees who seek refuge in her. She is all-power, achieve-
<>ments and assets personified. All imaginable permuta-
<>tions and combinations of every attribute comprise in
<>her and she it is who activates the universal soul.
<NI>2) {%Laks2mi1.%} This Devi1 is the most sublime form of the
<>universal soul, nay, the universal soul itself. She is all
<>wealth and riches personified, and she is the very seat of
<>beauty, compassion, welfare, peace, all goodness etc.
<>Evil traits like anger, avarice, haughtiness etc. are miles
<>away from her. She is all sympathy and kindness
<>towards her devotees. In Vaikun2t2ha, as Maha1laks2mi1 she
<>is ever engaged in the service of her husband, Vis2n2u.
<>In heaven she is the very glory of it. In houses she
<>appears as the welfare and prosperity of the inmates.
<>She is in fact beauty itself and is the essence of beauty
<>everywhere. She is all-merciful, and worshipped by
<>all.
<NI>(3) {%Sarasvati1.%} She is very base and fountain head of and
<>the presiding deity of the word, intellect, knowledge,
<>the arts etc. She also is of the form of the universal
<>soul and liberally grants intellect, poetical skill, reason
<>and logic, understanding capacity etc. to her devotees.
<>The finest music with all its beauties originates from
<>her. Yes, she is the goddess of all learning, fine arts and
<>every branch of knowledge. Like the ice piece, the
<>Jasmine flower etc. she is beautiful in her white cover.
<>She recited the holy names of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. She is of the
<>form of tapas and blesses those who perform it. In fact,
<>she it is who grants all gifts and powers of understand-
<>ing. She is the goddess of language and learning (Va1n2i1-
<>ma1ta1) and without her human beings would lose their
<>capacity to speak.
<NI>(4) {%Sa1vitri1devi1.%} She is mother of the four varn2as (castes,
<>classes) Veda1n3gas, the ta1ntric science etc. She is of
<>the form of Japa (chanting of holy names and mantras),
<>tapas, the effulgence of Brahman, the very essence of
<>truth and existence and supreme bliss. She is eternal
<>and grants salvation. She forms the very basis and pith
<>and core of the glowing presence of the universal soul.
<>This world is pure, and has been purified by the touch
<>of the sacred feet of this Devi1.
<NI>(5) {%Ra1dha1devi1.%} Ra1dhika1devi1, fifth of the pan5caprakr2tis is
<>the presiding deity over the five pra1n2as and She is of
<>the form of those pra1n2as. She is exceptionally beautiful
<>endowed with all fortunes and happiness, sublime and
<>serious, and the consort of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and as eternal
<>and equally endowed with divine attributes as the lord.
<>She is formless also, above and beyond attributes,
<>unattached and detached, and not visible even to the
<>great Devas and munis by the naked eye. Her clothes
<>even Agni would not burn. She was born, in Va1ra1ha
<>Kalpa as the daughter of Vr2s2abha1nu, and because her
<>sacred feet trod over this land, Bha1rata (India) became
<>holy. Once Brahma1 did tapas for 60,000 years to have
<>a glimpse of the Devi1's lotus feet, but could not. People
<>were able to see her only after she, in unbounded com-
<>passion for the world, incarnated herself in Vr2nda1vana
<>(See Prakr2ti).
<NI>4) {%Am3s4aru1pa(s)--partial manifestations of Devi1.%} The
<>above discussion was concerned with the five forms of the
<>Devi1 in her full and complete forms. Now, there are
<>six other Devi1s, who are partial manifestations or born
<>from certain parts of the Devi1. [Page217-b+ 64]
<NI>(1) {%Gan3ga1devi1.%} This Devi1 who flows in the form of
<>water and washes off men's sins takes her origin from
<>the body of Maha1vis2n2u. (There is another story which
<>traces Gan3ga1's origin to the An2d2a (egg or seed) of
<>Brahma1). (See Gan3ga1).
<NI>(2) {%Tulasi1.%} She is the lover and also the servant at
<>the feet of Vis2n2u. She also washes off men's sins and
<>promotes their welfare. (See Tulasi1).
<NI>(3) {%Manasa1devi1%} Manasa1devi1, who was born as a dau-
<>ghter of Kas4yapa is another partial incarnation of
<>Maha1ma1ya1. She is a great tapasvini1, a favourite dis-
<>ciple of S4an3kara, unique in learning and erudition,
<>sister of Ananta (the king of Serpents), the presiding
<>deity of Mantras, wife of Jaratka1ru muni and mother
<>of A1sti1ka muni. (See Manasa1devi1).
<NI>(4) {%Devasena1devi1.%} Since this Devi1 has been born out of a
<>sixth part of Maha1ma1ya1 she is called S2as2t2hi1devi1 also. It
<>is this Devi1, who gives children to living beings and also
<>protects them. For one year from the birth of a child
<>this Devi1 should be worshipped. Those who cannot
<>afford it should worship Devi1 on the 6th or 21st day
<>after a child is born. (See Devasena1).
<NI>(5) {%Man3galacan2d2ika1.%} She is born from the face of
<>Mu1laprakr2ti. Anybody who propitiates and pleases
<>her will be the recipient of all good things like sons and
<>grandsons, wealth, reputation, welfare etc. (See Man3-
<>galacan2d2ika1).
<NI>(6) {%Bhu1midevi1.%} She is the basis for all things, soil for
<>the origin of the vegetable kingdom, the treasure
<>house of all gems and the very incarnation of compas-
<>sion and sympathy. (See Bhu1midevi1).
<NI>5) {%Am3s4akala1devi1(s).%} Another class of devi1s who are
<>also partial manifestations of the Supreme Devi1. They
<>are born out of the parts of Maha1devi1. The following
<>are the Am3s4akala1devi1s.
<NI>(1) {%Sva1ha1devi1.%} Consort of Agni Bhagava1n (Fire God).
<>Sva1ha1 is worshipped in all the worlds. If havis (obla-
<>tion) is offered without repeating her name the Devas
<>will not accept it.
<NI>(2) {%Daks2in2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is wor-
<>shipped by all. Without this Devi1 all Karmans (actions)
<>in the world will become futile.
<NI>(3) {%Di1ks2a1devi1.%} Wife of Yajn5adeva, this Devi1 is worshipp-
<>ed by all.
<Poem>Di1yate vimalam3 jn5a1nam
<>Ks2i1yate karmava1sana1 /
<>Tena di1ks2eti sa1 prokta1.</Poem>
<>The Devi1 grants pure knowledge.
<NI>(4) {%Svadha1devi1.%} Wife of the Pitr2s, worshipped by manes
<>and men. Offerings made to the Pitr2s without honour-
<>ing this Devi1 will prove to be futile.
<NI>(5) {%Svastidevi1.%} Consort of the Va1yu. When offering Daks2in2a1
<>and making divya-da1na (divine gifts) if ‘Svasti’ (may
<>good happen) is not uttered the gifts will be of no use.
<NI>(6) {%Pus2t2idevi1.%} Wife of Gan2apati. If this Devi1 ceased to
<>exist men and women would become feeble, because
<>she is the source of all strength.
<NI>(7) {%Tus2t2idevi1.%} Consort of Ananta worshipped by every-
<>body. If the Devi1 ceased to exist there would be no
<>happiness in the world.
<NI>(8) {%Sampatti devi1.%} Wife of I1s4a1na. Worshipped by Devas
<>and men. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become poor and indigent.
<NI>(9) {%Dhr2ti.%} Consort of Kapila. Everybody worships her [Page218-a+ 64]
<>all the time. If the Devi1 ceased to exist the whole world
<>would become timid and cowardly.
<NI>(10) {%Sati1devi1.%} Wife of Satya. Well-wisher of all, this
<>Devi1 is worshipped by muktas. (people released from
<>worldly attachments). If the Devi1 ceased to exist there
<>would be no friendship and amity between people.
<NI>(11) {%Daya1devi1.%} Wife of Moha. If the Devi1 ceased to
<>exist the world would become hellish and a fierce battle
<>field.
<NI>(12) {%Pratis2t2ha1devi1.%} Wife of Pun2ya. In the absence of
<>this Devi1, who grants good and happy results to people's
<>actions the whole world would become as though it
<>were dead.
<NI>(13) {%Siddhadevi1.%}
<NI>(14) {%Ki1rtidevi1.%} Both the Devi1s, Siddha1 and Ki1rti are
<>wives of Sukarma1. If they ceased to exist the whole
<>world would be bereft of reputation and become lifeless
<>like a dead body.
<NI>(15) {%Kriya1devi1.%} Wife of Udyoga. If she ceased to exist
<>the whole world would become inactive and cease to
<>function.
<NI>(16) {%Mithya1d2evi1.%} Wife of Adharma. Wayward and
<>characterless people worship this Devi1. If the Devi1
<>ceased to exist the whole world as evolved by Brahma1
<>would cease to exist. This Devi1 was not seen anywhere
<>in the world during Kr2tayuga. She began to appear
<>in a subtle form here and there during Treta1yuga. In
<>dva1parayuga she attained more growth and then her
<>limbs and organs became doubly strong. In Kaliyuga
<>she developed to her full stature and growth and goes
<>about everywhere with her brother, Cheat (Kapat2a).
<NI>(17) {%S4a1ntidevi1.%} (see below).
<NI>(18) {%Lajja1devi1.%} Both the Devi1s, S4a1nti and Lajja1 are good-
<>natured wives. If they ceased to exist the world would
<>become dull and sleepy.
<NI>(19-20-21) {%Buddhidevi1, Medha1devi1%} and {%Dhr2tidevi1.%} These
<>three Devi1s are wives of Jn5a1na. If they ceased to exist
<>the world would become steeped in ignorance and
<>foolishness.
<NI>(22) {%Mu1rti.%} Wife of Dharma. She is very beautiful and
<>effulgent. In her absence the universal soul would be-
<>come devoid of vitality, helpless and meaningless.
<NI>(23) {%S4ri1devi1.%} Wife of Ma1li1. Her absence will make the
<>world lifeless.
<NI>(24) {%Nidra1devi1.%} Wife of Ka1la1gni. The Devi1, a sage
<>who has attained realisation, affects everybody in the
<>world during night and makes them lose consciousness
<>and plunges them in sleep. In the absence of this Devi1
<>the world will become a lunatic asylum.
<NI>(25-26-27) {%Ra1tri1, Sandhya1%} and {%Divasa1.%} These three are the
<>wives of Time (Ka1la). In their absence nobody would
<>have any sense of time and none would be able to cal-
<>culate and fix time.
<NI>(28-29) {%Vis4appu%} and {%Da1ham.%} Vis4appu = hunger.
<>Da1ham = thirst. These two Devi1s are the wives of
<>greed (Lobha). They go about the world affecting
<>people and thus making them worried and miserable.
<NI>(30-31) {%Prabha1devi1%} and {%Da1hika1 devi1%} are the wives of
<>Tejas (Vitality). Without them I1s4vara will find it im-
<>possible to continue the function of creation.
<NI>(32-33) {%Mr2tyu%} and {%Jara1%} are the consorts of Prakr2s2t2a-
<>jvara and daughters of Ka1la. And, if they cease to exist,
<>Brahma1's creation would also cease. (For Brahma1's
<>creation individual souls with the will for action are [Page218-b+ 65]
<>necessary. He cannot create a soul of his own. So
<>death is a pre-condition of creation, birth. If there is
<>no death there is no birth also. There is a school of
<>thought which maintains that if there is no death but
<>only birth there will not be space on earth for the living,
<>and therefore birth will stop if there is no death.).
<NI>(34-35) {%Tandra1%} and {%Pri1ti%} are the daughters of Nidra1 and
<>consorts of Sukha (pleasure, happiness). These Devi1s go
<>around the world on the orders of Brahma1.
<NI>(36-37) {%S4raddha1%} and {%Bhakti%} are the consorts of Vaira1gya
<>(aversion to wordly comforts, renunciation) and they
<>give salvation to the souls of the people in the world.
<NI>Aditi, mother of the Devas, Diti, mother of the Asuras,
<>Surabhi, mother of cows, Kadru1, mother of serpents
<>and Vinata1, mother of Garud2as are also involved in the
<>process of creation, and they are born out of parts of
<>Devi1.
<NI>6) {%Idol of Devi1.%} There are special injunctions for mak-
<>ing idols of the Devi1 for installation in temples. Can2d2i-
<>ka1devi1 should have twenty hands. The hands on the
<>right side should hold S4u1la, sword, disc, cord,
<>d2amaru, s4akti etc. and the hands on the left side should
<>hold na1gapa1s4a, flag, club, mirror etc. (There are also
<>idols with slight differences from the above).
<NI>Laks2mi1devi1 would hold in her right hand the lotus
<>flower and a Ku1vala fruit in the left. Sarasvati1devi1 will
<>have in her hands books, aks2ama1la1 and vi1n2a1. Gan3ga1devi1
<>rides on a makaramatsya (fish) holding in her hands
<>a pot and lotus flowers. Yamuna1devi1 rides the turtle
<>with a pot in hand and she is blue in colour.
<NI>Now, about the saptama1tr2s. Tumburu, white in colour,
<>and mounted on an ox rests on a s4u1la with vi1n2a1 in hand
<>before the Ma1tr2s. Among the Ma1tr2s Bra1hmi1 has four
<>faces, wears the aks2ama1la1 and holds the aks2apa1tra etc.
<>in her left hand. She is seated on a swan. S4a1n3kari1
<>(Ma1hes4vari1) is white in colour. She has in her right
<>hand bow and arrows, and the disc and bow in her left
<>hand. The ox is her vehicle. Kauma1ri1 is seated on the
<>peacock. She has two hands in one of which is held
<>S4akti (Vel). Laks2mi1 has in her right hand the conch
<>and disc, and the club and the lotus flower in her left
<>hand. Va1ra1hi1 rides the buffalo with staff, sword, club
<>and conch in her hands. Indra1n2i1 is seated on the club,
<>holding diamond in her hands. She has a thousand
<>eyes. Ca1mun2d2i1 has three eyes and is without flesh in the
<>body. Her hairs are raised above. She holds in her left
<>hand elephant's skin and s4u1la in the right hand. At
<>times she is seated on a corpse also.
<NI>Now, about the idols of the eight Am3ba1s. Rudra Carc-
<>cika1 holds a skull, S4u1la and cord in her hands. She
<>wears elephant's skin, her legs slightly held up. She
<>becomes Rudraca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes eight hands,
<>and holds the skull and the d2amaru. And in dancing
<>pose she is called Nat2es4vari1, and with four faces Maha1l-
<>aks2mi1. She is called Siddhaca1mun2d2a1 when she assumes
<>the form with ten hands and three eyes, and when she
<>eats men, horses and buffaloes. In this form she holds
<>in her right hand the sword, d2amaru etc. and in her
<>left hand the Tris4u1la, bell etc. Since the Devi1 is sarva-
<>siddhiprada1yika1 (giver of all divine attainments or
<>assets) she is Siddhayoges4vari1 also. There is also an-
<>other Devi1 in this very form who holds the pa1s4a and
<>Am3kus4a in her hand and who is slightly red in colour.
<>She is called Bhairavi1. When Bhairavi1 assumes the
<>form with twelve hands she is called Ru1pavidya1. All the [Page219-a+ 64]
<>above eight Devi1s were born in burial grounds and are
<>Raudramu1rtis. They are known as the As2t2a1mba1s.
<HI>DEVI1BHA1GAVATA. The S4aivas venerate this book as
<>one of the eighteen Pura1n2as. But according to the Vai-
<>s2n2avites, this is an authoritative book of a loftier level
<>than the eighteen Pura1n2as. (See under Pura1n2a).
<HI>DEVIKA1 I. (VEDIKA1). Daughter of Gova1sa, the S4ai-
<>bya King. She was wedded by Yudhis2t2hira in Svayam3-
<>vara, and to them were born a son called Yaudheya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Verse 76).
<HI>DEVIKA1 II. A holy centre. A dip in the ti1rtha there
<>will give the same result as that of a yajn5a. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 102).
<HI>DEVI1PI1T2HA. The dead body of Sati1devi1 crumbled into
<>small pieces and fell in different places in Bha1rata.
<>Each place where a piece of the dead body fell, is known
<>by the name Devi1pi1t2ha. There is a reason why the
<>dead body crumbled into pieces.
<NI>Daks2a performed a sacrifice to which S4iva was not invit-
<>ed and Sati1devi1 came to the sacrifice, and committed
<>suicide by jumping into the fire. S4iva who became furi-
<>ous, killed Daks2a and carrying the dead body of his
<>wife on his shoulder, walked the length and breadth of
<>Bha1rata like a mad man. It seemed that he was not
<>going to recover from this mania, and the devas (gods)
<>were worried at this. To rescue S4iva from this mental
<>disposition, Maha1vis2n2u, unseen by others, followed
<>S4iva with a bow and arrow. Whenever it was conve-
<>nient Maha1vis2n2u sent an arrow at the body of Sati1devi1,
<>on the shoulder of S4iva. By the hitting of the arrows
<>the body was crumbled into pieces and fell here and
<>there. Thus within a few days the body of Sati1devi1
<>came to an end and S4iva walked to Kaila1sa. The
<>pieces of the dead body fell in 108 places, and thus 108
<>Devi1pi1t2has came into existence. The names of the
<>places and the names by which the Devi1 is known in
<>such places are given below.

<HI>DEVI1STHA1NA. A holy place, dedicated to S4a1kam3bhari1
<>Devi1. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Vana Parva, Chapter
<>84, Stanza 13) that one who stays in this holy place
<>and eats greens (cira or kira) for three days will get
<>the fruits of eating greens for twelve years.
<HI>DEVI1TI1RTHA(M). The common name of three holy
<>centres (S4an3khini1, Madhuvat2i1, Mr2gadhu1ma1) in Kuruk-
<>s2etra. Those who bathe in S4ankhini1 will become beauti-
<>ful in appearance, while those who bathe in Madhu-
<>vat2i1 and Mr2gadhu1ma1 will get the benefits of perform-
<>ing a thousand goda1nas (gifts of cows).
<HI>DHA. This letter means dha1ran2a, S4obhana, Dha1ta1, dhat-
<>tu1ra (umma plant). (Chapter 348, Agni Pura1n2a).

<>27, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAKA. A king of the Yaya1ti dynasty. (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHANAPA1LA. A Vais4ya who lived in the city of Ayo-
<>dhya1. He built in Ayodhya1 a temple for the Sun-god
<>and appointed, for a year, paying his wages in advance,
<>a scholar well versed in Pura1n2as to read aloud the
<>Pura1n2as in the temple. After six months Dhanapa1la
<>died and as a result of the goodness accrued to him by
<>his worthy deeds the Sun-god came to him with his
<>chariot and took him to his place and seating him on
<>his seat paid respects to him. Later he was taken to
<>Brahmaloka. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Brahma Ka1n2d2a,
<>Chapter 94).
<HI>DHANAS4ARMA1. A brahmin belonging to Madhyades4a.
<>Once when Dhanas4arma1 went to the forest to get
<>darbha he confronted three fierce evil spirits and gett-
<>ing frightened ran away from them. But the spirits
<>followed him and the Brahmin then cried and said
<>“Oh, please do not harm me. Maha1vis2n2u will bless
<>you.”
<NI>The moment they heard the name of Vis2n2u there came
<>a change in them. They reiterated their story to
<>Dhanas4arma1. Their names were Vais4a1kha, Suda1sa and
<>Advaita. Because of the ingratitude of Vais4a1kha he
<>got a nick-name ‘Kr2taghna’ (ungrateful man) also. All
<>the three were human beings in their previous birth.
<>Not only that, Advaita was a king called Harivi1ra.
<>All the three became evil spirits because of their sins.
<NI>From the conversation Dhanas4arma1 understood that
<>Vais4a1kha was his father and they then knew each other. [Page220-b+ 64]
<>The son then anxiously enquired what he should do to
<>absolve his father of his sins and save him from hell.
<>Vais4a1kha then told him observe the vrata, Vais4a1kha-
<>pu1rn2ima1. He did that and all the spirits went to
<>heaven. (Chapter 94, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAVARDHANA. A virtuous Vais4ya who lived in
<>the island of Pus2kara in the Kr2tayuga. Once Dhana-
<>vardhana after having performed Vais4vadeva sat for
<>his food. At that time he heard a cry from outside
<>“Annam3 dehi (give me food)”. Dhanavardhana imme-
<>diately came out to see who the visitor was but seeing
<>none went in and started taking his food. Because he
<>ate his food once left aside, his body was torn to
<>hundred pieces. (Bhavis2ya, Brahma Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANAVATI1. See Su1ryaprabha1.

<>bind the horses to the chariot of S4iva during the time
<>of burning to death the Tripuras. (S4loka 29, Chapter

<HI>DHANAN5JAYA II. Another name for Arjuna. (See under
<>Arjuna).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA III. The army given to Subrahman2ya by
<>S4iva. (S4loka 17, Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA IV. A Sanskrit critic who lived during
<>the period between 11th and 12th century A.D. He was
<>a member of the court of King Mun5ja. His important
<>work is ‘Das4aru1paka’. This work contains three
<>hundred s4lokas divided in four separate divisions. After
<>the death of Mun5ja, Dhanika, brother of Dhanan5jaya,
<>wrote a commentary on this work. The treatise is
<>named ‘Das4aru1pa1valoka’. There are several quotations in
<>this from the Sanskrit dramas ‘Ven2i1sam3ha1ra’ and ‘Ratna1-
<>vali1’. He has in this work discussed Drama and Poetry
<>in general giving prominence to the emotional side of it.
<>The critical work, Das4aru1pa1valoka, contains quotations
<>from a book ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ by Dhanika himself. But
<>the work ‘Ka1vyanirn2aya’ has not yet been made avail-
<>able. Even in composing poetry Dhanan5jaya was well
<>versed. He is the author of the well-known epic ‘Ra1ghava-
<>pa1n2d2avi1ya’. It is known as ‘Dvisandha1na Ka1vya’ also.
<>This is based on the lives of Pa1n2d2avas and S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<NI>Dhanan5jaya bears the name of S4rutaki1rti also. It is
<>stated by scholars that Ra1ghavapa1n2d2avi1ya was written
<>during the period 1123 to 1140 A.D. (History of classi-
<>cal Sanskrit Literature).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA V. There was once a brahmin ascetic
<>called Dhanan5jaya in the gotra of Vasis2t2ha. This hermit
<>had hundred wives and got hundred sons, one by each
<>of his wives. The son born of his wife S4a1bha1ka (S4ala1ka)
<>was named Karun2a. The father divided his assets
<>equally among his sons and yet they quarrelled with
<>each other.
<NI>Once Karun2amuni went to the shores of Bhava-
<>na1s4ini1 along with a few other munis to worship
<>Narasim3ha. There a brahmin had brought a lovely
<>lime as an offering to the deity. Karun2a took the lime
<>from him and smelt it. At this the brahmin got angry
<>and cursed him. “Sinner, may you live as a fly for a
<>hundred years. Then Maha1tma1 Dadhi1ca will give you
<>back your original form.” Karun2a instantly became a [Page221-a+ 65]
<>fly and he pleaded to his wife thus “Beloved, I have
<>become a fly. Please do protect me.” Karun2a started
<>flying hither and thither and his cruel brothers made
<>the fly fall in oil and killed it. S4ucismita1, wife of
<>Karun2a, started weeping laying the dead fly in her lap.
<>Arundhati1devi1 passing that way saw her and consoled
<>her thus: ‘S4ucismita1, stop lamenting. I shall bring it
<>to life this instant by sacred ashes.’ So saying the Devi1
<>took some ashes from the fire-pit and reciting the
<>powerful Mr2tyun5jaya mantra sprinkled it on the dead
<>body of the fly. S4ucismita1 fanned the fly. The potency
<>of the ashes brought the fly back to life.
<NI>After a hundred years one of his relatives killed it
<>again. S4ucismita1 grief-stricken, took the dead fly to the
<>Mahars2i, Dadhi1ca. The sage told her thus: “It was
<>bhasma (sacred ashes) that gave life three times to
<>Jamadagni, Kas4yapa, the devas and myself. I will,
<>therefore, give life to thy husband by bhasma itself.”
<>Dadhi1ca took some ashes and meditating on Mahes4vara
<>recited a mantra and sprinkled it on the dead fly and
<>brought it back to life. By the touch of Dadhi1ca, the
<>fly, husband of S4ucismita1, became Karun2a again and
<>both of them went back to their hermitage. (Chapter
<>101, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANAN5JAYA VI. A brahmin devotee of Maha1vis2n2u
<>who lived in the Treta1 yuga. Once, in winter, when
<>for want of proper clothing he could bear the biting
<>cold no longer, he broke some twigs of the As4vattha
<>tree (poplar leafed fig tree) and made fire to warm
<>him. When Dhanan5jaya broke the twigs it gave reflec-
<>tive pain on the body of Maha1vis2n2u. But Maha1vis2n2u
<>who was aware of the unflinching devotion of Dhanan5-
<>jaya to himself was not displeased but appeared before
<>Dhanan5jaya with wounds all over the body. The
<>Brahmin enquired how Vis2n2u got the wounds and on
<>knowing that it was the consequence of his breaking the
<>twigs of As4vattha Dhanan5jaya in utter grief started to
<>cut his own head off. Greatly pleased Vis2n2u stopped
<>him from his attempt and asked him to name a boon.
<>Very modestly he replied that he would be satisfied if
<>he was given the strength to continue as a devotee of
<>Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Ka1n2d2a).
<HI>DHANES4VARA. A Brahmin born in the city of Avanti.
<>Abandoning the duties enjoined by scriptures to a
<>Brahmin he strayed away from the Brahmin fold doing
<>all sorts of sins. He became a store-house of sins. He
<>was engaged in commerce and once while travelling he
<>reached the city of Ma1his2mati1. There he met many people
<>from several adjoining villages who had come there to ob-
<>serve the Ka1rttika Vrata. Later Dhanes4vara was bitten by
<>a cobra there and fell down fainting. Very soon he died.
<NI>When he died the messengers of Yama came
<>and took him bound to Ka1lapuri1. There, Citra-
<>gupta read out to Yama all the sins Dhanes4vara had
<>committed from boyhood till his death. Citragupta
<>added “Even from boyhood there is no record of any
<>good deed done by him. On the other hand the sins he
<>has committed could not be told in a year. He is an
<>incarnation of evil. He must be roasted in hell till the
<>end of the world.” On hearing this the body of Yama
<>blazed like flame with anger and calling aside an atten-
<>dant he ordered, “Hi, Pretapa1laka, take this sinner
<>away, beat him with spiked clubs and throw him into
<>Kumbhi1pa1ka”. Pretapa1laka instantly took him away
<>and breaking his head with a thorn-spiked club threw [Page221-b+ 64]
<>him into a copper vessel containing burning oil. But to
<>his great amazement the burning oil became cold as
<>soon as the body of Dhanes4vara came into contact with
<>it just as it happened once before in the case of Prahla1da.
<>The perplexed attendant ran to Yama and told him of
<>this strange incident. Yama was also surprised at this
<>novelty in hell and called back Dhanes4vara and started
<>enquiring about his life once again. Na1rada came there
<>at that time. Both of them then talked about Dhanes4vara.
<>Na1rada told Yama how the unanticipated thing so
<>happened because Dhanes4vara on the eve of his death
<>spent some time with people who were observing the
<>Ka1rttika Vrata washing away thus all the sins accumu-
<>lated so far in his life. Hearing that Yama took Dhanes4-
<>vara round hell and giving Dhanes4vara, the position of
<>a Yaks2a sent him to Kuberapuri1. (Chapter 115, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHANI. A messenger of the asuras called Kapas. The
<>Kapas once sent Dhani to preach moral code among the
<>Brahmins. (Chapter 157, Anus4a1sana Parva, M.B.)
<HI>DHANIKA. A Sanskrit poet. (See Dhanan5jaya IV).
<HI>DHANUGR2HA. (DHANUGRAHA, DHANURDHARA)
<>One of the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed
<>in the great battle by Bhi1masena. (S4loka 62, Chapter 84,
<>Karn2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANUVAKTRA. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>62, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANURVEDA.
<NI>{%General information.%} A scientific treatise on the art of
<>warfare in ancient Bha1rata. Because of the undue im-
<>portance of the science the treatise is deemed and respect-
<>ed as a Veda. There have been innumerable books on the
<>subject to teach Dhanurveda to the Ks2atriya youths.
<>In the book ‘Prastha1nabheda’ by Madhusu1dana Saras-
<>vati1 he states that Dhanurveda is a branch of Yajurveda.
<>A Sanskrit book called Dhanurvedasam3hita1 is now
<>available. Some scholars are of opinion that not much
<>antiquity can be attributed to this work. Many books
<>relating to Dhanurveda have been lost to us. What
<>details are there in Agni Pura1n2a are given below:
<NI>2) {%Divisions of Dhanurveda.%} This is known as Catus2pa1da
<>(four-footed) also because of the fact that the four
<>main constituents of an army are the chariots, elephants,
<>horses and men. Dhanurveda has been divided into
<>five parts (1) Yantramukta, (2) Pa1n2imukta, (3) Mukta-
<>sandha1rita, (4) Amukta and (5) Ba1huyuddha. There is
<>another division according to Astra and S4astra. There
<>is yet another division of the science into two by some
<>scholars from a different viewpoint calling them Ma1ya1
<>and R2ju.
<NI>{%Yantramukta%} (Yantra = machine). This means a war-
<>fare where machines are used. Ks2epin2i1 (sling) bow and
<>arrow and other such machines are included in this.
<NI>{%Pa1n2imukta.%} (Pa1n2i = hand). This is where the hand is used
<>mainly. Stone, mace etc. are used in this.
<NI>{%Muktasandha1rita.%} This includes the use of weapons like
<>a spear.
<NI>{%Amukta.%} The use of a weapon like a sword which never
<>leaves your hand.
<NI>{%Ba1huyuddha.%} (Ba1hu = head). The fight with only bare
<>hands without the use of a weapon. One who wishes
<>to fight should make ready his own weapons. He should
<>be one who will never get tired even after exertion. A
<>war with bows and arrows is considered the best and [Page222-a+ 65]
<>most manly, that with a spear ranks next, a fight with a
<>sword is bad and a fight with hands, the most mean.
<NI>3) {%The Trainees.%} Only a brahmin is entitled to be a pre-
<>ceptor in Dhanurveda. The Ks2atriya and Vais4ya should
<>learn from him. The S4u1dra can fight of his own in
<>danger. He is not allowed to learn military science
<>from a preceptor. Those mixed-born are to help the
<>king during a war.
<NI>4) {%Various postures.%} There are nine different ways of
<>standing when you give a fight, classified according to
<>the different positions of one's foot, heel and knee.
<NI>{%Samapa1da.%} When you stand with your An3gus2t2ha, Nari-
<>ya1n2i (Gulpha), Pa1n2i and Pa1da closely joined together,
<>it is termed Samapa1da.
<NI>{%Vais4a1kha.%} Keep your legs twentyseven inches apart and
<>without bending your knees stand erect throwing your
<>weight on the fingers of the foot. This stand is called
<>Vais4a1kha.
<NI>{%Man2d2ala.%} Keep your knees thirtysix inches apart and
<>stand in the shape of a ham3sapan3kti and this position
<>is called Man2d2ala.
<NI>{%A1li1d2ha.%} Bend your right knee and thigh in the shape of a
<>plough and without any movement to that posture
<>draw your left leg fortyfive inches apart. This stand is
<>called A1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Pratya1li1d2ha.%} If you bend your left knee and thigh and
<>stand like above it is called Pratya1li1d2ha.
<NI>{%Ja1ta.%} Place your right foot straight and place the left one
<>perpendicular to the right one with the heels and the
<>ankles of the feet five fingers apart. The whole length
<>of the posture should not exceed twelve fingers. This
<>stand is called Ja1ta.
<NI>{%Dan2d2aya1ta.%} Keep the right knee bent and the left leg
<>straight or vice versa. This posture is called Dan2d2a1yata.
<NI>{%Vikat2a.%} If for the above posture the distance between
<>the two legs is two palm-length it is Vikat2a.
<NI>{%Svaput2a.%} Keep the knees vigun2as and the feet Utta1yanas
<>for the posture of Svaput2a.
<NI>{%S4vastika.%} Keep your legs sixteen fingers apart and raise
<>your feet a little keeping the level of both the feet equal.
<>This is Svastika.
<NI>5) {%Use of arrows.%} Before a man is to make use of a bow
<>and arrow he should first take the posture of Svastika
<>and bow down. He should take the bow by the left hand,
<>take the arrow by the right hand. He then should adopt
<>a posture of either Vais4a1kha or Ja1ta and taking the bow
<>should sink into the earth one end of the bow and
<>draw the bow-string up to the other end and see whe-
<>ther there is sufficient length for the string. He should
<>take an arrow from his sheath and thrust the arrow-
<>head into the ground near the bow. He should
<>place his elbow on the top of the arrow with his forearm
<>bent and fist clenched. If the clenched fist touches the
<>top of the bow that bow and arrow is superior to any
<>other. He should tie the bow-string in a way that the
<>distance between the tied bow-string and the bow is
<>twelve fingers. He should place the bow in front of his
<>navel and the arrows in a quiver on his hip. Taking an
<>arrow he should raise the bow and fix the arrow at a
<>point on the bow-tring between his eye and ear. He
<>should take the arrow by his left fist and fix it so that the
<>fist touches the left nipple. The bow should not change
<>position horizontally, vertically, laterally, face down-
<>wards or upwards. Then taking an arrow from the sheath
<>by the thumb and forefinger fix it on the bow-string and [Page222-b+ 65]
<>stretch it well before sending the shot. The clue to
<>correct aim is this. Anything that one can see with one's
<>eyes but can be covered by his fist is within the arrow-
<>shot. When one arrow is sent another should be taken
<>immediately from the sheath and sent in quick succes-
<>sion. This is called Upaccheda.
<NI>6) {%Operations with a sword and a carma (shield).%} There
<>are thirtytwo different ways of putting into use a sword
<>or a ‘carma’ (shield). Bhra1nta, Udbhra1nta, A1viddha,

<NI>9) {%Dhanurveda in Maha1bha1rata.%} Some references to Dhanur-
<>veda in Maha1ha1rata are given below:
<NI>(1) A sage named S4aradva1n was a noted preceptor in
<>Dhanurveda. Kr2pa1ca1rya learnt Dhanurveda from him
<>and taught many others of his disciples. (Chapter 129,
<>A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(2) Dron2a1ca1rya learnt Dhanurveda from Paras4ura1ma [Page223-a+ 65]
<>and imparted it to many other disciples of his including
<>the Kauravas and Pa1n2d2avas. (Chapter 129, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<NI>(3) Agnives4a, a sage, learnt Dhanurveda from sage
<>Agastya. (S4loka 9, Chapter 133, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(4) Dhanurveda has got ten an3gas and four caran2as.
<>(Chapters 6 and 41, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<NI>(5) Four-footed Dhanurveda worshipped Subrahman2ya.
<>(S4loka 22, Chapter 44, S4alya Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHANUS2A. An ancient sage. He was a priest in the ya1ga
<>of Uparicaravasu. (S4loka 7, Chapter 336, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>DHANUS2A1KS2A. An ancient sage. He killed Medha1vi1,
<>son of the sage Ba1ladhi, accusing Medha1vi of having
<>mocked other sages (S4loka 50, Chapter 135, Vana Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>DHANVA. One of the Kings of Ka1s4i. Dhanvantari was
<>born as his son. (For details see under Dhanvantari).
<HI>DHANVANTARI I. A deva who was a preceptor in
<>A1yurveda.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} The devas and asuras together churned the
<>milky ocean, Ks2i1ra1bdhi, to salvage Amr2ta (Nectar) from
<>it. After thousand years there arose from the ocean a
<>deva with a Kaman2d2alu (water-pot of ascetics) in one
<>hand and a dan2d2a in the other. That deva was Dhan-
<>vantari, (S4loka 31, Sarga 45, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>The birth of Dhanvantari from the ocean of Milk is
<>described in Chapter 29 of Harivam3s4a thus:
<NI>Prosperous-looking Dhanvantari rising above the water-
<>level of Ks2i1ra1bdhi stood worshipping Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u
<>gave him the name of Abja. Dhanvantari is thus known
<>by the name of Abja also. Dhanvantari bowing to
<>Vis2n2u said “Prabho, I am your son. Allot to me
<>yajn5abha1ga”.
<NI>Vts2n2u replied thus: “Portions of yajn5a have already
<>been allotted. Because you were born after the devas
<>you cannot be considered as one among them. You will
<>be born again in the world for a second time and then you
<>will be a celebrity. In your second life even from while
<>in the womb you will have knowledge of An2ima1 and
<>Garima1. Therefore you will be born as a deva incar-
<>nate. You will write in eight divisions a book on
<>A1yurveda; your second life will be in Dva1para yuga.”
<>After having said so much Vis2n2u disappeared.
<NI>2) {%Rebirth of Dhanvantari.%} Suhotra, King of Ka1s4i, in
<>the second Dva1para yuga had two sons, S4ala and Gr2tsa-
<>mada. S4unaka was the son of Gr2tsamada. S4ala got a son,
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a. Ka1s4a was born to A1rs2t2is2en2a. To Ka1s4a was
<>born Di1rghatapas (Dhanva1). For a long time Dhanva1
<>did not have any children and so he went and did
<>penance to propitiate Abjadeva. Abjadeva (Dhanvan-
<>tari) was pleased and was born as a son to Dhanva1.
<>Dhanva1 named the boy as Dhanvantari and the latter
<>taught his disciples A1yurveda, by parts, eight in num-
<>ber. From Dhanvantari in order were born Ketuma1n--
<>Bhi1maratha--Divoda1sa. (Chapter 29, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>3) {%Dhanvantari and Pariks2it.%} There is a story in the
<>pura1n2as that when Taks2aka went and bit Pari1ks2it to
<>kill him, a Vis2aha1ri (one who cures those infected with
<>snake venom) rushed to save the king but was bribed
<>and sent back by Taks2aka. There are indications in
<>the Pura1n2as to show that the Vis2aha1ri under reference
<>was Dhanvantari though it is stated that Kas4yapa was
<>the person involved. (See under Taks2aka).
<NI>4) {%Dhanvantari and Manasa1devi1.%} In the Kr2s2n2ajanma [Page223-b+ 65]
<>Khan2d2a of Brahmavaivarta Pura1n2a there is a story
<>connecting Dhanvantari with Manasa1devi1, a serpent-
<>goddess.
<NI>Once Dhanvantari with his disciples was going to Kaila1sa.
<>On the way Taks2aka made a venom-spitting hiss. At
<>once one of the disciples of Dhanvantari boldly went
<>and plucked the diamond on the head of Taks2aka and
<>threw it to the ground. Hearing this Va1suki, King of
<>serpents, sent to Dhanvantari thousands of serpents
<>under the leadership of Dron2a, Pun2d2ari1ka and Dhanan5-
<>jaya. The poisonous breath of all these serpents joined
<>together made the disciples of Dhanvantari swoon.
<>Immediately Dhanvantari by a medicine made from
<>vanaspati made all his disciples recover and then sent
<>all the serpents to a swoon. When Va1suki heard this
<>he sent the serpent-maid, Manasa1devi1, a disciple of
<>S4iva, to face Dhanvantari. Manasa1devi1 and Gad2u1ra
<>were both disciples of S4iva. But Dhanvantari was a
<>follower of Gad2u1ra. Manasa1devi1 made all the disciples
<>of Dhanvantari swoon but the latter because of his great
<>proficiency is Vis2avidya1 soon brought back his disciples
<>to normal. When Manasa1devi1 found that it was impos-
<>sible to defeat Dhanvantari or his disciples by using
<>poison Manasa1devi1 took the tris4u1la given to her by S4iva
<>and aimed it at Dhanvantari. Seeing this S4iva and
<>Brahma1 appeared before them and pacifying them sent
<>them all their way.
<HI>DHANVANTARI II. (Amr2ta1ca1rya). An eminent medi-
<>cal scientist born in the ambas2t2ha caste. There is no
<>reference anywhere in the Pura1n2as regarding any
<>relationship between the two Dhanvantaris. There is
<>the following story about Amr2ta1ca1rya in Ambas2t2ha1ca1ra-
<>candrika1.
<NI>Once Ga1lava Mahars2i went to the forest to collect
<>darbha and firewood. He walked for long and felt
<>thristy and hungry. Then he saw a girl coming that
<>way with water and Ga1lava quenched his thirst taking
<>water from her. Pleased with her the Mahars2i blessed
<>her saying “May you get a good son.” The girl replied
<>that she was still unmarried. Ga1lava then made a figure
<>of a male with darbha and told her to get a child from
<>that figure. She was a Vais4ya girl named Vi1rabhadra1
<>and she got a beautiful child of that darbha male.
<>Because the boy was born to a Vais4ya of a brahmin
<>male he belonged to the Ambas2t2ha caste. The boy was
<>named Amr2ta1ca1rya.
<HI>DHANYAMA1LA1. The foster-mother of Atika1ya. (See
<>Atika1ya).
<HI>DHARA1. Wife of a Vasu named Dron2a (see under
<>Nandagopa).
<HI>DHARA I. He is the first Vasu born to Dharma of his
<>wife Dhu1mra1. (S4loka 19, Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<HI>DHARA II. A king who was a friend of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(S4loka 39, Chapter 158, Dron2a Parva, M.B.).
<HI>DHA1RA. A holy place. If one bathes in this holy
<>place (Bath) his sorrows will be at an end. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanza 25).
<HI>DHA1RAN2A1. One of the eight means of Ra1jayoga (One
<>of the ways of union with the supreme Spirit). Yama,
<>Niyama, A1sana, Pra1n2a1ya1ma, Pratya1ha1ra, Dha1ran2a1,
<>Dhya1na and Sama1dhi are the eight means (See under
<>Ra1jayoga).

<HI>DHARAN2A(M). A measure. In ancient times a dharan2a
<>was made up of ten palas. (Manusmr2ti).
<HI>DHARA1PA1LA. A king of ancient times. He ruled over
<>a country named Vidis4a1. There is a holy place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet. Dhara1pa1la cons-
<>tructed a temple at the confluence. There is a story also
<>for his doing so.
<NI>Once a S4iva-pa1rs2ada brought to S4iva a woman at a time
<>when Pa1rvati1 was away from the place. S4iva and the
<>woman were enjoying each other when Pa1rvati1 came
<>to the place. Getting angry she cursed the Pa1rs2ada and
<>made him into a fox. The fox came to the place where
<>the rivers Vetasi1 and Vetravati1 meet and did penance
<>there and attained Moks2a. Dhara1pa1la saw the divine
<>plane coming down to take the Pa1rs2ada away and he,
<>therefore, constructed a temple at the place where the
<>plane landed. He then arranged scholars well versed
<>in Vedas and s4a1stras to read Padma Pura1n2a there. He
<>himself read Padma Pura1n2a and attained moks2a.

<>Moda; Unnati--Darpa; Buddhi--Artha; Medha1--
<>Sukr2ti; Titiks2a1--S4ama; Hri1--Pras4raya. Mu1rti gave
<>birth to the virtuous Narana1ra1yan2as. Sunr2ta1 became the
<>mother of the devas, Satyavrata and Satyasena.
<>Satyasena became famous by slaying many cruel and
<>evil-natured Yaks2as, demons and spirits. Lamba1 gave
<>birth to R2s2abha and Vidyotana. R2s2abha got a son,
<>Indrasena. Vidyotana became the father of stanayitnu.
<>Kukubh delivered San3kat2a and San3kat2a became the
<>father of Ki1kat2a and Durgadeva. Ja1mi got a son Svarga
<>and of him was born Nandi1. Vis4va1 gave birth to Vis4va- [Page224-b+ 60]
<>devas and Sa1dhya1 to Sa1dhyas. These Sa1dhyas are different
<>from those born of Brahma1. Sa1dhyas became the father of
<>Arthasiddhi. Marutvati1 gave birth to Marutvat and
<>Jayanta. Vasu gave birth to eight sons and they were
<>known as As2t2avasus. Dron2a, the first of the As2t2avasus,
<>married Abhimati. Abhimati is known as Dhara1 also.
<>It was Dron2a and Dhara1 who were born as Nandagopa
<>and Yas4oda1 later. Pra1n2a, second of the As2t2avasus,

<>great ascetics. (See under Narana1ra1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%The daughter named Dharmavrata1.%} Dharmadeva got a
<>daughter named Dharmavrata1 of his wife Dharmavati1.
<>Dharmavrata1 was an ascetic and she was married to
<>Mari1ci, son of Brahma1. One day Mari1ci came back
<>from the forest after getting darbha and flowers extre-
<>mely tired and so after food lay down to rest. His wife
<>sitting by his side massaged his legs. The sage fell as-
<>leep. Then Brahma1 came there and Dharmavrata1
<>attended on him and worshipped him. Mari1ci, when he
<>woke up, finding Dharmavrata1 attending on another
<>man cursed her and made her into stone. Dharmavrata1
<>pleaded not guilty and standing inside a fire-pit did pen-
<>ance for ten thousand years. Brahma1 and other devas
<>appeared before her and consoled her by assuring that
<>though she would be a stone devas would take their
<>abode in it and that she would be worshipped by all.
<>From that day onwards that stone was known as Devas4ila1
<>and even now it is believed that Brahma1 and other
<>devas live therein. (Chapter 114, Agni Pura1n2a).

<>Brahmin and carried away by its horns the Aran2i stick
<>which the Brahmin owned for making fire by attrition.

<>to normal. (See under Dharmaputra).
<NI>(7) Dharmadeva went to Vis4va1mitra in the guise of

<NI>(8) Following a directive from Brahma1, Dharmadeva
<>once brought before Varun2a all the daityada1navas bound
<>by ropes. (Chapter 128, Udyoga Parva).
<NI>(9) Maha1vis2n2u was born as a son of Dharmadeva. (See
<>under Narana1ra1yan2a). [Page225-a+ 65]
<NI>(10) Dharma worshipped a brahmin named Satya tak-
<>ing the form of a deer. (S4loka 17, Chapter 272, S4a1nti
<>Parva).
<NI>(11) Dharma tested Sudars4ana taking the form of a
<>brahmin. (S4loka 79, Chapter 2, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(12) Dharma saved a sage named Vatsana1bha from a
<>great downpour taking the shape of a buffalo. (Chapter
<>12, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(13) Dharma disguised as a brahmin, went and impart-
<>ed advice to Janaka, father of Si1ta1. (Chapter 32, As4va-
<>medha Parva).
<NI>(14) To test Jamadagni, Dharma went to his a1s4rama
<>taking the form of Anger. Jamadagni had just milked
<>Ka1madhenu and kept the milk in a pot. Dharma as
<>Anger crept into the milk. Jamadagni drank it and yet
<>remained calm. Seeing this Dharma appeared before
<>him in the form of a Brahmin and blessed him assuring
<>Jamadagni that in future he would be obedient to
<>Dharma (Chapter 91, As4vamedha Parva).
<NI>(15) When at the fag end of their life the Pa1n2d2avas
<>started on their Maha1prastha1na, Dharma as a dog
<>accompanied them up to the gates of heaven. (S4loka
<>22, Chapter 5, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).
<NI>7) {%Dharma and Ka1la.%} There is a misunderstanding found
<>even in some Pura1n2as that Ka1la, the chief of Ka1lapuri1,
<>and Dharma are one and the same person. But if the
<>stories around each are examined it is easy to deduce
<>that they are two different devas. The father and
<>mother of Dharmadeva is Brahma1. The father of Ka1la
<>is Su1rya and mother Sam3jn5a1, daughter of Vis4vakarma1.
<>This itself is a sufficient evidence to show that the two
<>are different persons. Further, Ka1la or Yama is the
<>sixth descendant of Vis2n2u.
<NI>But scholars are misled to think that the two are iden-
<>tical. There is a reason for it.

<NI>The above are the synonyms of Ka1la. Vya1sa has used as
<>synonyms for Dharmadeva in the Maha1bha1rata the
<>words Dharmara1ja, Vr2s2a and Yama. Now among the
<>synonyms for the two there are two words in common--
<>Dharmara1ja and Yama. This has led to this misunder-
<>standing. Because Ka1la weighs the evil and good in
<>man he got the name Dharmara1ja. Dharmadeva got
<>that name because he is the incarnation of Dharma.
<>The real name of Ka1la is Yama. Dharmadeva got the
<>name Yama because he possesses ‘Yama’ (control of
<>the self for moral conduct). Ka1la has no sons; Vidura
<>and Yudhis2t2hira are the sons of Dharmadeva.
<HI>DHARMABHR2T. A mahars2i who was an inhabitant of
<>Dan2d2aka1ran2ya. This sage narrated to S4ri1 Ra1ma the
<>story of the pond ‘Pan5ca1psara’ and the ga1nadha1ra1 that
<>rises from it. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya, Sarga 11).
<HI>DHARMABUDDHI. See under Mitrabheda.
<HI>DHARMADA. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 72,
<>Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>DHARMADATTA I. A king of Kosala. He had a wife
<>named Na1gas4ri1. By her chastity she became a celebrity
<>and got the name of Arundhati1 of the earth. They got
<>a daughter named Ta1ra1datta1. Once when Dharmadatta
<>and Na1gas4ri1 were engaged in conversation both remem- [Page225-b+ 64]
<>bered their lives in their previous births. It was not
<>allowed to speak about previous births in open and if
<>anybody did so death was the penalty. But Na1gas4ri1
<>could not control herself and prepared to accept the
<>worst. Na1gas4ri1 told her husband thus: “I am just remin-
<>ded of my life in my previous birth. I will tell you my
<>story. I was the servant maid of a brahmin named
<>Ma1dhava in this same place. I had a husband named
<>Devada1sa then. My husband was the son of a merchant.
<>We made a small house of our own and lived there
<>peacefully. Each of us would bring food from where we
<>worked and everyday we used to set apart a portion of
<>what we got for guests and the pitr2s. We were satisfied
<>with what was left after that. If we got more than one
<>set of clothes we would give it to the poor. Then there
<>came a famine in the country. Our earning also was
<>reduced daily. We lived in hunger. One day a hungry
<>and tired sannya1si1 came to our place and we gave him
<>the whole of our food. My husband died that
<>day and I gave away my life jumping into the funeral
<>pyre of my husband. Then I was born in the family of
<>a King and became your wife.”
<NI>Dharmadatta also got back the memory of his previous
<>birth. He said he was the Devada1sa of Na1gas4ri1's
<>previous life.
<NI>The moment they finished talking about their previous
<>births both fell down dead. Orphaned Ta1ra1datta1 then
<>lived under the care of her mother's younger sister.
<>After some time a Mahars2i came to their house and by
<>his blessing Ta1ra1datta1 got a husband named Kalin3ga-
<>sena. Kalin3gasena was a brave and daring Prince. Very
<>soon they got a daughter and she was named Kalin3ga-
<>sena1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5juka1 lam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 2).
<HI>DHARMADATTA II. A Brahmin who lived in the city
<>of Karavi1ra. One day while Dharmadatta was going to
<>the temple with material for pu1ja1 he came across a
<>demoness named Kalaha1 on the way. The brahmin
<>threw the pu1ja1 materials in his hand on to the face of
<>the demoness. When a tulasi1 leaf touched the demoness
<>she got back the memory of her previous birth.
<NI>Kalaha1 then abandoned her cruel nature and begged
<>Dharmadatta to advise her as to how she should get a
<>release from her demonaic life. Taking pity on her
<>Dharmadatta gave her all the ‘pun2ya’ he had obtained
<>by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Chapters 106, 107, Uttara
<>Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a and Chapters 2, 4, 24, 25
<>Skanda Pura1n2a).
<NI>Dharmadatta and Kalaha1 were born as Das4aratha and
<>Kaikeyi1 in their next births as a result of the accumulat-
<>ed Pun2ya obtained by observing Ka1rttikavrata. (Sa1ra
<>khan2d2a, A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>DHARMADHVAJA. See under Tulasi1.
<HI>DHARMAGUPTA I. A prince who obtained blessings
<>from S4iva by observing the Prados2avrata. (For detailed
<>story see Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DHARMAGUPTA II. A Nandara1jakuma1ra belonging to
<>the Lunar dynasty. Chapters 1, 2 and 13 of Skanda
<>Pura1n2a gives the following story about him.
<NI>Once Dharmagupta went to the forests, hunting. Deeply
<>interested in the game he never knew when it became
<>dusk. It was late to go back to the palace and so decid-
<>ing to stay in the forest for the night he climbed upon a
<>tree and made a seat there to rest. After some time a bear [Page226-a+ 64]
<>followed by a lion came running and took refuge on the
<>top of the same tree. The lion stood growling below.
<>Seeing a man on the same tree the bear said “Oh, Prince,
<>we are both in the same sad plight now. Believe me
<>as a friend. We can spend the night on this tree safe.
<>Therefore, go to sleep till midnight and I will keep
<>watch over. After that I will go to sleep and you keep
<>watch”. Gladly accepting the proposal the prince went
<>to sleep and the bear kept vigil. Then the lion suggested
<>to the bear to push down the prince. The bear replied
<>that he would never cheat a friend and that it was a
<>great sin also to do so. After midnight the bear slept
<>and the prince kept watchover. The lion then suggest-
<>ed to the prince to push down the bear. Thinking that
<>he would be saved if the bear is given to the lion the
<>unfaithful prince pushed the bear down. But the bear
<>escaped catching hold of the branches lower down.
<>Embittered at this the bear cursed Dharmagupta and
<>made him mad.
<NI>Then addressing Dharmagupta first and the lion next
<>the bear said thus: “I am Dhya1naka1s2t2ha a sage of the
<>Bhr2gu family. I can take any form I like. I cursed you,
<>Dharmagupta, because you cheated a friend. This lion
<>is Bhadra, one of the ministers of Kubera. Once he
<>entered into sexual act with a bear in front of the
<>a1s4rama of Gautama at midday and the sage cursed him
<>and made him into a lion. The sage as a relief from the
<>curse had further decreed that he would get his origi-
<>nal form when he entered into a conversation with me.”
<>When Dhya1naka1{??}ha finished speaking the lion changed
<>itself into the form of Bhadra.
<NI>Dharmagupta remained mad and his father, the King,
<>approached Jaimini for help. The sage said that the
<>prince would be cured of his madness if he bathed in the
<>Pus2karin2i1 ti1rtha. The king did as was suggested and
<>Dharmagupta was cured.
<HI>DHARMA1KARA. A righteous house-holder. Once a
<>prince entrusted his beautiful wife with Dharma1kara
<>and went away. Though she lived with him for six
<>months he did not have any kind of contact with her.
<>The prince returned. Wicked people tried to arouse
<>doubts about the chastity of his wife and the house-
<>holder. But it was futile. Still fearing calumny Dharma1-
<>kara entered fire. In that test by fire he came out victo-
<>rious. Not only did his body remain unscorched, but
<>also that the faces of the wicked people who blamed
<>him were filled with leprosy and became ugly. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i khan2d2a, Chapter 50).
<HI>DHARMAKETU. A king of Bha1rgava gotra. He was the
<>son of Suketu and father of Satyaketu. (Navama Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMANANDANA. A king of the family of Bha1rgava.
<>(Navama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>DHARMA1N3GADA. A Brahmin who became a deep
<>meditator on Vis2n2u, because of his habits in his previous
<>life. Dharma1n3gada was the son of Rukma1n3gada by
<>his wife Sandhya1vali1. Rukma1n3gada was the son of
<>R2tadhvaja who lived in the city of Vidis4a1. He was
<>a man of good personality, who lived with his
<>father and being a generous man he did not hesitate to
<>give his head to Mohini1 for the pleasure of his father.
<>God Vis2n2u was pleased with him because of his love of
<>his father and of his loyalty to Vais2n2avite deity and took
<>him bodily to heaven (Vaikun2t2ha). Dharma1n3gada [Page226-b+ 64]
<>lived there for many thousands of years enjoying heaven-
<>ly pleasures. Then he went astray from divine life
<>and had to take life again as Suvrata the son of a
<>Brahmin named Somas4arma1.
<NI>The wise Suvrata discarded the passions of Ka1ma (desire),
<>Krodha (anger) etc. and controlled his senses and engag-
<>ed himself in penance in Vaid2u1ryamaha1dri. For hun-
<>dred years he sat in meditation and Maha1vis2n2u was
<>pleased with him and took him and his father to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. At the instruction of Maha1vis2n2u, Suvrata
<>took life again in the house of Kas4yapa. When he died
<>he went to Vaikun2t2ha. In every successive birth he had
<>the remembrance of his previous birth. (Padma Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 21).
<HI>DHARMANETRA I. A king of the Hehaya family. He
<>was the son of Hehaya and father of Kr2ti. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 2).
<HI>DHARMANETRA II. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (S4loka 60,
<>Chapter 94, A1di Parva).
<HI>DHARMAPA1LA. A minister of Das4aratha. There were
<>eight ministers for Das4aratha: Sr2s2t2i, Jayanta, Vijaya,
<>Siddha1rtha, Ra1s2t2ravardhana, As4oka, Dharmapa1la and
<>Sumantra. (Chapter 6, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>DHARMAPRASTHA. A sacred place. It is believed to
<>be the abode of Dharmara1ja. There is a general assum-
<>ption that anybody who touches the water in a well
<>there will be absolved of all sins. (S4loka 99, Chapter
<>94, Vana Parva).
<HI>DHARMAPUTRA. The eldest of the Pa1n2d2avas, the
<>others being Bhi1masena, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Arjuna.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Pa1n2d2u, brother of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, had two wives,
<>Kunti1 and Ma1dri1. There was a curse for Pa1n2d2u that he
<>would die the moment he touched his wife. (See under
<>Pa1n2d2u). Kunti1, the first wife of Pa1n2d2u, had obtained
<>from Durva1sas five mantras. The mantras were very po-
<>tent. If she called upon any god reciting the mantra that
<>God would manifest himself to her and bless her with a
<>son. When Kunti1 found that Ga1ndha1ri1 was pregnant and
<>was about to deliver she became anxious and meditating
<>on Dharmadeva recited one of the mantras given by Dur-
<>va1sas and got a child from him. The boy was born at mid-
<>day on the eighth Jyes2t2ha day of the year on Pan5cami1
<>and at the auspicious hour, Abhijit. At the time
<>of his birth there was a celestial voice which said “This
<>boy will become a very righteous and bold King, best
<>among the virtuous. He will be known as Yudhis2t2hira”.
<>Obeying the dictate of the mysterious voice he was
<>named Yudhis2t2hira. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 123).
<NI>3) {%Boyhood.%} When he had five sons Pa1n2d2u went to the forest
<>of S4atas4r2n3ga together with his family to spend the spring
<>time there. The sages residing in that forest conducted
<>the christening ceremony of Dharmaputra. Kas4yapa,
<>priest of Va1sudeva, performed the Upanayana ceremony
<>(thread-wearing) of Dharmaputra (Chapter 123, Da1ks2i-
<>n2a1tyapa1t2ha) A1di Parva, M.B.). Ra1jars2i S4uka imparted
<>instructions to Dharmaputra on spear-warfare. Pa1n2d2u
<>died during their stay there. Ma1dri1 abandoned her life
<>by jumping into her husband's funeral pyre. Before
<>doing so she called Dharmaputra to her side and join-
<>ing her hands together said “Son, you are now the father
<>to your brothers.” When Pa1n2d2u and Ma1dri1 were dead
<>the sages of the forest took Kunti1 and the children to
<>Hastina1pura and entrusted them to the care of Bhi1s2ma [Page227-a+ 65]
<>detailing to him all that had happened in the forest.
<>(Chapter 125, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>4) {%Kauma1ra (youth).%} Dharmaputra and his brothers spent
<>their boyhood in Hastina1pura along with Duryodhana
<>and his brothers. Bhi1masena became a great foe of
<>Duryodhana and his brothers and Duryodhana always
<>nurtured a desire to kill Bhi1masena. Once Duryodhana
<>invited Dharmaputra and his brothers to have aquatic
<>games in the Gan3ga1. Accepting the invitation Dharma-
<>putra participated in the games along with his brothers.
<>One night Duryodhana caught hold of Bhi1ma alone and
<>tied him with ropes and threw him into the river. When in
<>the morning Dharmaputra found his brother missing he
<>ran to his mother to inform her of the loss. Kunti1 asked
<>him to start a search and while he was on it Bhi1masena
<>appeared before him and told him how he was thrown
<>into the river by Duryodhana and how he went to
<>Na1galoka and was brought to earth with great acquisi-
<>tions from there. Dharmaputra advised them not to
<>make the incident public. They received training in
<>warfare in Hastina1pura under Dron2a1ca1rya. Dharmaputra
<>got great proficiency in chariot-fighting. As Gurudaks2in2a1
<>(fee for the preceptor) Dharmaputra agreed to bring
<>Drupada bound before the preceptor. But Arjuna stop-
<>ped him and himself undertook the task (Chapters 127
<>to 136, A1di Parva, M.B.).
<NI>5) {%Becomes heir-apparent and goes to the forest.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>crowned Dharmaputra as the heir-apparent when the
<>latter had successfully completed his course of study in
<>warfare. By his good conduct, righteousness and adminis-
<>trative efficiency Dharmaputra excelled his father and be-
<>came very popular among his subjects. Jealous of this
<>Duryodhana decided to destroy the Pa1n2d2avas somehow.
<>With the permission of his father, Duryodhana cons-
<>tructed a palace at Va1ran2a1vata for the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>reside there. That palace was built of La1ks2a1 (See
<>under Arakkillam). The entire population resented
<>this act of Duryodhana and rebuked him. They tried
<>to follow Dharmaputra to Va1ran2a1vata and stay there.
<>But by tactful words he made them abandon that idea.
<>Still many brahmins followed Dharmaputra. After some
<>days Duryodhana set fire to the palace. But the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas escaped through a tunnel from the house which had
<>been constructed without the knowledge of Duryodhana
<>just at the time of construction of the building. Escap-
<>ing from there the Pa1n2d2avas reached the forests and
<>travelling farther came to the shore of the Gan3ga1.

<NI>7) {%How Dharmadava tested Yudhis2t2hira.%} The Pa1n2d2avas
<>travelling through the forests reached Dvaitavana. A
<>brahmin among their group was making fire by the
<>aran2i sticks when a deer rushed at him and took the
<>aran2i sticks away, carrying them on its horns. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas ran after the deer and they travelled far
<>away from their place, still not getting scent of it. They
<>were all tired and thirsty. Yudhis2t2hira directed
<>Nakula to climb on the top of a tree and investigate
<>whether there was any water anywhere nearby. Nakula
<>did so and reported that he could see a pond not far
<>from the place where they were sitting. Yudhis2-
<>t2hira asked Nakula to go and fetch water. Nakula did
<>not return for a long time and Sahadeva was asked to
<>go and enquire. Sahadeva also did not return and
<>Arjuna was sent in search of them. When Arjuna did
<>not return Bhi1masena went to enquire. Bhi1masena also
<>did not return and finally Yudhis2t2hira himself set out in
<>search of them. On reaching the pond Yudhis2t2hira
<>was dumbfounded to see his brothers lying dead on
<>the banks of the pond. Weeping bitterly Yudhis2t2hira
<>entered the pond and to his surprise he heard a voice
<>from the air addressed to him thus: “Ho, Yudhis2t2hira,
<>I am a stork living on the small fishes of this pond.
<>This pond is my hereditary property. It was I who
<>killed your brothers. I will ask you certain questions.
<>If you answer them correctly you can drink from this
<>pond. If not, you will also die.
<NI>Dharmaputra:--“I do not believe that you are simply
<>a bird. My brothers are renowned for their valour and
<>have defeated not only the devas, da1navas, gandharvas
<>and ra1ks2asas but also the four huge mountains like
<>Hima1laya Pa1riya1tra, Vindhya and Malaya. I am eager
<>to know your true self who have slain such brave
<>brothers of mine.”
<NI>Yaks2a:--“I am a Yaks2a and not merely a bird. I
<>objected to your brothers' taking water from the pond. [Page228-b+ 64]
<>But waving aside my objections they started taking
<>water from the pond and then I slew them. Now,
<>hear my questions: Who carries the Sun? Who are his
<>followers? Who makes the sun set? On whom does
<>the sun exist?”
<NI>Dharmaputra:--It is Brahman who carries the Sun.
<>Devas are his followers. Dharma makes him set. He
<>exists on Satya.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How does Maha1siddhi come to he S4rotriyas?
<>(those who study the Vedas).
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--It happens by deep penance.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the reason for a brahmin getting divi-
<>nity? What deed is equal to good conduct? What makes
<>a brahmin mortal and what makes him evil?
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira:--The Brahmin gets divinity by medita-
<>tion. Austerity is equal to good conduct. Death makes
<>a brahmin mortal and abusive words make him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the divinity of Ks2atriyas? What is
<>equal to good nature? What makes them mortal and
<>what makes them evil?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The divinity of a Ks2atriya is weapon.
<>Sacrifice is equal to good conduct. Fear makes him
<>mortal and non-sacrifice makes him evil.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the best thing for agriculture? What
<>is the most important thing for agriculture? What are
<>the installations of the atmosphere and child-birth?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The best thing for agriculture is rain.
<>The important thing for agriculture is seed. The ins-
<>tallation of atmosphere is rays and that of child-birth
<>is child.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is lifeless even though he breathes?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--He who never offers oblations to a
<>deva, a guest or a servant is like the dead even though
<>he breathes.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is bigger than the earth? What is higher
<>than the sky? What is swifter than the wind? What
<>are greater in number than grass?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Mother is bigger than the earth.
<>Father is taller than the sky. Mind is swifter than the
<>wind. Thoughts are greater in number than grass.
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is it that does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep? What is it that does not grow after birth? What
<>is heartless? What grows very quickly?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A fish does not shut its eyes when
<>asleep. An egg does not grow after its birth. A stone
<>is heartless. A river grows very quickly.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a friend to one who lives outside his
<>country? Who is a friend to a householder, to a patient
<>and to one dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--For one who leaves his country the
<>friend he gets on his way is the best friend. To a house-
<>holder his wife is his friend, to a patient his doctor and
<>to one dead, charity.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a guest of all? What is Nectar? What
<>is spread throughout the world?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Agni (fire) is the guest of all. Moon
<>(Candra) is the nectar. Air is that which is spread
<>throughout the world.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who circles around solo? Who is born again?
<>What is the remedy for cold? What gives the maximum
<>yield?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The Sun circles solo. Candra is born
<>again. Fire is the remedy for cold. Earth gives the
<>maximum yield. [Page229-a+ 64]
<NI>Yaks2a:--What is the soul of Man? Who is the com-
<>panion given by God? What is Upaji1vana?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--The soul of Man is his son. The com-
<>panion given by God is wife. Cloud is Upaji1vana.
<NI>Yaks2a:--How do you become rich? How do you be-
<>come happy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--If you abandon lust you will be rich.
<>If you abandon desire you will be happy.
<NI>Yaks2a:--By what is this world covered? By what does
<>the world become clear? By what does one lose his
<>friend? What is the obstacle for an entry into heaven?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--Dullness covers the world. World
<>becomes clear by intelligence. A friend is lost by desire.
<>Domestic ties stand in the way of getting into heaven.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who are those equal to the dead? Which
<>country is dead?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A poor penniless man is equal to the
<>dead. The country where there is mob-rule is dead.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Who is a pandit? Who is an atheist? Who is
<>wicked? What are lust and jealousy?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--A righteous man is a pandit. An
<>atheist is wicked. Lust is the cause of worldly life.
<>Jealousy is the cause of worry.
<NI>Yaks2a:--Though charity, wealth and lust are incom-
<>patible with each other when do they unite together?
<NI>Dharmaputra:--When charity and wife compromise
<>the above three blend together harmoniously.
<NI>The Yaks2a was highly pleased with the replies given by
<>Dharmaputra. He then offered to revive one of his bro-
<>thers and asked Dharmaputra to name whom he should
<>do so. Then Yudhis2t2hira named Nakula. Yaks2a then
<>enquired why he had named Nakula leaving aside Arjuna
<>and Bhi1ma. Dharmaputra replied that though Kunti1
<>and Ma1dri1 were two wives of Pa1n2d2u they were both
<>mothers to them and so he wanted to see one of the
<>sons of Ma1dri1 alive. He therefore pressed the name of
<>Nakula again. The Yaks2a who was none other than
<>Dharmadeva was immensely happy to hear that reply
<>and gave life to all his brothers. He confessed to
<>Yudhis2t2hira that it was he who in the form of a deer
<>came and ran away with the aran2i sticks. He returned
<>the aran2i sticks also. Dharmadeva then advised them
<>to go and spend their life incognito at the court of King
<>Vira1t2a blessing them with the assurance that they
<>would never be found out during their life in disguise.
<>Dharmadeva disappeared after this and the Pa1n2d2avas
<>returned to their a1s4rama. (Chapters 312 and 313 of
<>Vana Parva, M.B.).

<>(Chapter 107 to 115, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<NI>(17) In the meantime Dron2a1ca1rya made a vow that he

<NI>(28) Yudhis2t2hira slew Candrasena and Drumasena who

<NI>(31) Duryodhana at this time went to a lake in Dvai-
<>pa1yana and lay there immersed under water. Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira went there with an army and challenged him for a
<>fight. (S4loka 18, Chapter 61, S4alya Parva).
<NI>(32) When Yudhis2t2hira won the war he sent S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>to Hastina1pura to console Ga1ndha1ri1. (S4loka 40, Chap-
<>ter 62, S4alya Parva).
<NI>10) {%Yudhis2t2hira is crowned King.%} When Yudhis2t2hira won
<>the war he sent Nakula to bring Pa1n5ca1li1. He went
<>round the Kuruks2etra battle ground and saw his own
<>kith and kin lying dead and the sight made him faint.
<>After that he went to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Ga1ndha1ri1 cursed
<>him for killing her sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 gave a piercing
<>look at the nails on the foot of Dharmaputra when he
<>stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 bowing down, Instantly the
<>nails turned black. Yudhis2t2hira gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the
<>names of all the prominent persons who were killed in
<>the war Dhr2tara1s2t2ra ordered Yudhis2t2hira to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. It was at this stage that Yudhis2t2hira
<>came to know from Kunti1 that Karn2a was his brother.
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept bitterly when he knew the secret from
<>his mother and cursed womankind as a whole stating
<>that woman would thereafter be incapable of keeping a
<>secret to herself. The news of the death of Karn2a gave
<>a sudden mental turn-back to Yudhis2t2hira and he
<>decided to renounce all and go to the forest. He
<>called aside his followers and announced his decision to
<>them. At that time Vya1sa came there and preached to
<>him about the perishable nature of life. Yudhis2t2hira
<>then asked him what he should do for the atonement
<>of the sins committed. Though he strongly desired to
<>go to the forest Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a did not allow him
<>to do so and sent them all to Hastina1pura. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas entered the city the people gave them a
<>rousing reception and Yudhis2t2hira was crowned King.
<>(Chapters 10 to 17 of Sauptika Parva, Chapters 12 to
<>27 Stri1 Parva, Chapters 1 to 40 S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>11) {%Administration.%} When Yudhis2t2hira became King,
<>with the permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, he distributed the
<>various administrative responsibilities among his bro-
<>thers. He took for himself the task of taking care of
<>their kith and kin and friends. He gave many gifts to
<>the brahmins and other dependants. He once went to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a to express his gratitude for him. He visited
<>Bhi1s2ma lying on his bed of arrows accompanied by
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and his brothers. Bhi1s2ma revealed to him
<>the inner import of Ra1jadharma, A1paddharma and
<>Moks2adharma. Receiving the blessings of Bhi1s2ma
<>Yudhis2t2hira and his brothers returned to Hastina1pura.
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to the Hima1layas to get riches from
<>Marutta before performing an As4vamedha Sacrifice.
<>While on his way to the Hima1layas he fasted for a night
<>and worshipped S4iva. People like Vya1sa and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>partook in the sacrifice. After the sacrifice was over
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra desired to go to forest and sought the
<>approval of Yudhis2t2hira to do so. On hearing that
<>Yudhis2t2hira wept. But on the advice of Vya1sa he gave his
<>approval for Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to go to forest. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>appealed to him through Vidura for funds to perform the
<>obsequies of the dead. Bhi1ma objected to this but [Page230-b+ 65]
<>Yudhis2t2hira reprimanded him and silenced him and
<>gave Dhr2tara1s2t2ra enough funds for his purposes. Kunti1
<>and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to the forest.
<>Yudhis2t2hira accompanied by Pa1n5ca1li1 and Sahadeva
<>went and saw them in the forests after a few days.
<>(Chapters 41 to 55, S4a1nti Parva, Chapters 92 from
<>Anus4a1sana Parva and As4vamedha Parva and Chapter
<>26 from A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>12) {%Vidura merges into Dharmaputra.%} When Dhr2tara1s2t2ra,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 went to forest Vidura also accepted
<>sannya1sa and left for the forest. There sitting under a
<>tree he started doing penance. After a few days Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira came to the forest to see his mother and others.
<>After spending some time with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and Kunti1 he went to the place where Vidura was
<>doing penance. Vidura started running the moment he
<>set eyes on Yudhis2t2hira and the latter ran after him.
<>After some time Vidura turned back and stood staring
<>at Yudhis2t2hira. At that time the soul of Vidura escap-
<>ing from his body merged with that of Yudhis2t2hira.
<>The body of Vidura stood stiff and leaned against a tree.
<>Taking him to be dead Yudhis2t2hira started to do the
<>funeral rites and then there resounded a voice from
<>heaven saying that Vidura was not dead. The unknown
<>voice was from Dharmadeva. When the voice subsided
<>Vidura became his old self again. Yudhis2t2hira went
<>back. (Chapter 26, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>13) {%The end of Dharmaputra.%} Soon after his return from
<>the forest Na1rada came to Hastina1pura and told him of
<>the death of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1 in a
<>wild fire in the forest. Lamenting deeply Yudhis2t2hira
<>performed the obsequies at Hastina1pura. It was at
<>this time that the Ya1dava dynasty perished and Dva1raka1
<>was sunk into the ocean. The Pa1n2d2avas then crowned
<>Pari1ks2it as their successor and entrusted Yuyutsu with
<>the administration of the State till Pari1ks2it came of age.
<>Vajra was appointed as chief of Indraprastha. The
<>obsequies of Va1sudeva, Balara1ma and Kr2s2n2a were per-
<>formed at Hastina1pura. Kr2pa1ca1rya was appointed as
<>preceptor to Pari1ks2it. After having made all such
<>arrangements the Pa1n2d2avas commenced their Maha1pras-
<>tha1na. The five Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 started from
<>Hastina1pura. A dog also followed them. Yudhis2t2hira
<>walked ahead. On the way, one by one, Pa1n5ca1li1 Saha-
<>deva, Nakula, Arjuna and Bhi1masena fell dead. Alone
<>with a dog to keep company, Yudhis2t2hira reached a
<>plateau on the top of the Hima1layas and there Indra
<>was waiting for him with a chariot. But Yudhis2t2hira
<>said that he would not come to heaven without his

<>already reached heaven. Yudhis2t2hira insisted that the
<>dog also should be taken to heaven which Indra
<>blankly refused. But Yudhis2t2hira refused to ascend the
<>chariot without the dog which, he said, had given him
<>company from the start to the finish. The dog then
<>changed itself into Dharmadeva and he complimented
<>him on his sense of justice. When Yudhis2t2hira entered
<>heaven he saw Duryodhana sitting in all luxury and glory.
<>Yudhis2t2hira did not like it but Na1rada pacified him.
<>Yudhis2t2hira saw all his relatives sitting there. A devadu1ta
<>took him round hell also. When he heard the pitiable
<>groans from there Yudhis2t2hira thought his right place
<>was with them. But Indra and Dharmadeva again con-
<>soled him. He was given a bath in A1ka1s4agan3ga1. He then
<>lost his mortal form and his soul entered Divyaloka. [Page231-a+ 64]
<>Standing in the form of Dharmadeva he saw all his

<HI>DHARMARA1JA. A king of Gaud2ades4a. He became
<>King at a time when Jainism was getting more and
<>more hold on the people and the Hindu Vedic rites
<>were getting less and less popular among the people.
<>The King thought it was his duty to revive the interest
<>in the Vedic rites and so became a priest himself
<>and did much propaganda on the superiority of the
<>same, writing several books on the subject for the benefit
<>of the people. (Bhavis2yapura1n2a, Pratisarga Parva).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA. A Brahmin. He had many children.
<>The major portion of his life was spent in hard work
<>to support his large family. After that he went in
<>search of means to attain heaven. In his quest, he
<>happened to reach the realm of Na1gas (serpents). He
<>entered the house of a Na1ga named Padmana1bha.
<>When he reached the house Padmana1bha had been away
<>carrying the chariot of the Sun. Dharma1ran2ya sat out-
<>side the house and spent a few days in vow and medita-
<>tion. Then Padmana1bha returned. The Bra1hman2a asked
<>Padmana1bha about the ways of attaining heaven. The
<>Na1ga replied that there was none superior to the Sun.
<>The Brahmin accepted penance and lived in the hermit-
<>age of Cyavana for a few days. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, 4
<>Chapters from 361).
<HI>DHARMA1RAN2YA(M). A forest which is a holy place.
<>It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva Chapter 82

<>He had a hundred wives but no children. At last, at an
<>old age, he got a son of Sucandra1, wife of his elder
<>brother. But the hunderd wives of Dharmasakha were
<>pining for having a son and so the king consulted his
<>ministers and on their advice conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i
<>yajn5a (a sacred sacrificial ceremony for obtaining chil-
<>dren) at Hanu1matkun2d2a near the southern sea-coast.
<>As a result of that each of his hundred wives got a
<>child. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapter 15).
<HI>DHARMAS4ARMA1 I. A brahmin who was born a parrot
<>named Kan5jala in his rebirth. Dharmas4arma1 was one of [Page231-b+ 65]
<>the three sons of an eminent Brahmin called Vidya1dhara.
<>His other two sons were Vasus4arma1 and Na1mas4arma1.
<>While both his brothers became great scholars Dhar-
<>mas4arma1 never studied anything and became a muff.
<>His father was greatly worried on account of this.
<>Dharmas4arma1 never heeded the advice of his father
<>and went about in bad company ruining himself. Years
<>went by and Dharmas4arma1 became old.
<NI>One day Dharmas4arma1 was sitting repentant in a
<>temple sadly pondering over his past when a siddha
<>came to the temple. Watching him Dharmas4arma1 saw
<>him go and sit in a lonely place for meditation with his
<>eyes shut. Dharmas4arma1 went and stood near him
<>very respectfully. When the Siddha opened his eyes
<>after some time he saw Dharmas4arma1 standing before
<>him and then the Siddha made enquiries about Dhar-
<>mas4arma1. The latter then requested the Siddha to give
<>him instructions to acquire the supreme knowledge.
<>The Siddha then gave him Jn5a1nopades4a (advice on
<>knowledge) and Dharmas4arma1 soon became a Siddha
<>himself. He then started on a pilgrimage and on the
<>way he got a parrot. He took care of the bird just like
<>his son and loved it very affectionately. One day when
<>Dharmas4arma1 was away from the place to collect
<>fruits for his food a cat caught and ate the parrot.
<>Greatly grief-stricken Dharmas4arma1 wept bitterly and
<>ran about like a mad man. After some days he died
<>and because at the time of death he was thinking about
<>the parrot he was born a parrot in his next birth. The
<>jn5a1nopades4a of the siddha was still lingering in him
<>while he died and so even in his life as a parro the never
<>lost the jn5a1na he had acquired in his previous life.

<>he saw Ka1pakalpa, the servant of merchant Ratna1kara,
<>being killed by an ox. Though Ka1pakalpa was a sinner,
<>his end aroused pity in the heart of the Brahmin. So he
<>sprinkled the Ganges-water on the body of Ka1pakalpa,
<>who instantly regained life and energy. The Brahmin
<>who saw the power of Ganges-water began to worship
<>the Ganges from that day onwards. It is mentioned in
<>Padma Pura1n2a, Kriya1 Khan2d2a, Chapter 7, that finally
<>the Brahmin got a boon from the Ganges that only
<>uttering the name of the Ganges should he meet with
<>death.

<HI>DHARMAVYA1DHA. Though he was born in the caste
<>of foresters he became a saint by following the path of
<>duty and righteousness. In his previous birth he was a
<>Brahmin. He was a friend of a king who was an adept
<>in archery. Once both went on hunting expedition to the
<>forest. The brahmin sent an arrow at a wild animal but
<>the arrow went and struck a sage who was doing
<>penance under a tree. When the sage was rolling on the
<>arrow he said: “Oh, evil-natured Bra1hman2a, may you
<>be born as a hunter selling flesh in your next life.” The
<>Brahmin went and apologised to the sage and craved
<>for pardon. Taking pity on him the sage consoled him
<>by saying that though he would be born as such, he
<>would be a great scholar and attain moks2a by doing his
<>duty without even once wavering from it.
<NI>The Brahmin was born a hunter in the country of
<>Mithila1 He took to looking after his parents as a vow
<>and soon became a top-ranking righteous man. He did
<>his duty to which he was born. He sold meat and
<>earned a living. He never killed or butchered an animal.
<>One day a Brahmin named Kaus4ika was doing penance
<>sitting under a tree when a crane perched on the top
<>of its branches defiled the Brahmin's head with its
<>droppings. The Brahmin in rage looked up and his
<>powerful stare burnt the crane and it fell down dead.
<>Leaving that place some time later he went to a house
<>to beg. The house-wife informed him that he would be
<>given alms only after attending to her husband. The
<>Brahmin was not pleased with her reply. Seeing that she
<>added “Please do not look at me like that. I am no
<>crane. To me my husband is supreme.”
<NI>The Brahmin was taken aback when he heard the lady
<>mention the incident of the crane. The lady explained
<>to him that all her powers were due to her devotion to
<>her husband and advised the Brahmin to go and meet
<>Dharmavya1dha of Mithila1 to remove the egoism in him.
<>Obeying her instructions Kaus4ika went and accepted
<>Dharmavya1dha as his guru. The learned hunter then
<>spoke to Kaus4ika about Varn2adharmas, S4is2t2a1ca1ras,
<>him3sa1 and ahim3sa1, Mi1ma1m3sa1 relating to dharma and
<>karma, the importance and glory of Brahmavidya1, the
<>significance of the control of the senses, Trigun2as, Pra1n2a-
<>va1yu, service to father and mother and many such
<>other things. The egoism of Kaus4ika was removed and
<>he returned home. Devoted to his parents he attained
<>heaven. (Chapters 27 to 33, Vana Parva).

<>pleased with him and helped him in various ways.
<NI>The gan2as of S4iva were amazed at S4iva's partiality for
<>Dhi1radhi1. Paramas4iva told them the story of the former
<>birth of Dhi1radhi1. “This Brahmin was a swan in his
<>former life. Once he was flying over a lake when he
<>became tired and fell down. His colour became black.
<>Then Kamalini1, another swan who dwelt in the same
<>lake told him to recite the tenth Chapter of Gi1ta1, and
<>to meditate on S4iva. Because the swan did that holy
<>act, he was born a Brahmin in his next birth. Though
<>he was a Brahmin in his previous birth, he kicked his
<>teacher and for that fault he had to take birth as a
<>swan. Later, because of the love of S4iva, Dhi1radhi1
<>attained heaven. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,

<HI>DHR2S2T2ABUDDHI. A Vais4ya who attained heaven by
<>performing the fast of Vais4a1kha Vrata. He lived in the
<>country of Bhadra1vati1, on the bank of the River

<>five sons: Sumanas, Dyutima1n, Medha1vi1, Sukr2ta and
<>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi. The last of them turned out to be a
<>wicked man. Going after many women, keeping
<>company with wicked people, gambling, wandering
<>about in search of harlots, not venerating Gods, Manes
<>or Bra1hman2as, wasting the money of his father, eating
<>untouchable food, drinking liquor and such other acts,
<>he indulged in. Once he was seen walking in the
<>street with his hand on the shoulder of a harlot. So his
<>father turned him out of the house. He was discarded
<>by his relatives too. He sold the ornaments he had on
<>his body. When that was finished the harlots also
<>evaded him. He became a destitute having no money
<>or clothes. When he became tired with hunger and
<>thirst he began stealing in that city. The King's men
<>caught him. They chained him and scourged him.
<>Finally, he went to the forest and with a bow and
<>arrows he lived by hunting.
<NI>Dhr2s2t2abuddhi happened to reach the hermitage of
<>Kaun2d2inya. It was the month of Vais4a1kha. While
<>Kaun2d2inya was coming from the Ganges, having taken
<>bath, a drop of water fell on Dhr2s2t2abuddhi from the
<>wet cloth of the hermit, and consequently his sins were
<>washed off. He fell before the hermit and requested
<>him to instruct him in the way of attaining heaven. [Page234-a+ 65]
<>The hermit advised him to observe the fast of Vais4a1kha-
<>s4uklaika1das4i1 known as Mohini1. Accordingly he observed
<>the fast and became sinless. Invested with a divine form
<>he entered the realm of Vis2n2u. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara

<HI>DHR2S2T2ADYUMNA. The son of King Drupada. He was
<>brother of Pa1n5ca1li1.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Drupada and Dron2a were fellow students. After
<>finishing his education Drupada became King. When
<>Dron2a came to his palace Drupada did not honour
<>him. Dron2a got angry, went to Hastina1pura and began
<>to teach the Pa1n2d2ava and the Kaurava princes in
<>archery and other weapons. When the weapon-training
<>was over, Arjuna, at the instruction of Dron2a, defeated
<>and captured Drupada. Dron2a seized half of his king-
<>dom from him.
<NI>As Drupada was not powerful to wreak vengeance on
<>Dron2a, he performed a sacrifice to obtain a son who
<>could take revenge on Dron2a and regain his lost
<>prestige. A son and a daughter were born from the
<>sacrificial fire. The son was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna.
<>The daughter grew up and became the famous Pa1n5ca1li1.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas married her.
<NI>At the time of birth, Dhr2s2t2adyumna had a crown on
<>his head, and armour on his body, bow, arrows and
<>sword in his hands. He ran out of the fire into a
<>chariot and sat in it as if he were about to begin a
<>travel of conquest. Seeing this the Pa1n5ca1las were filled
<>with joy. There was a celestial voice: “This boy will
<>destroy the fear of the Pa1n5ca1las. He is born to slay
<>Dron2a.” At this time the queen approached the sacri-
<>ficing priest with a request that the children born of the
<>sacrificial fire should consider her as their mother.
<>Accordingly the children accepted the wife of Drupada
<>as their mother. Bra1hman2as named the boy Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna and the girl Kr2s2n2a1.

<F>2. Because he was born with Dhr2s2t2atva (boldness) amars2atva (impatience) and dyumna (vigour) the son of Drupada was
<>called Dhr2s2t2adyumna. Draupadi1 was called Kr2s2n2a as she was of Kr2s2n2a varn2a (dark complexion. Thus Drupada got two children from
<>‘Makha’ (sacrifice).</F> (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>166). (For more particulars see under ‘Pa1n5ca1li1’
<>Para 2).
<NI>2) {%Till the battle of Bha1rata.%} The history of Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna till the battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas, is given below.
<NI>The news that Dhr2s2t2adyumna was born to kill Dron2a
<>spread everywhere. The Broad-minded Dron2a did not
<>seem to mind this news. Dron2a took Dhr2s2t2adyumna to
<>his house, with the permission of Drupada and gave
<>him training in the wielding of weapons. He believed
<>that God's will could not be thwarted. After he had
<>learned archery Dhr2s2t2adyumna returned to his kingdom.
<>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna at the svayam3vara
<>(marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li. Several kings arrived from
<>various countries on that occasion. When the auspici-
<>ous moment came, Dhr2s2t2adyumna brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to
<>the nuptial dais. He proclaimed the rules and condi-
<>tions that the competitors of Svayam3vara had to
<>observe. After that he conversed with each king who
<>was present. In the Svayam3vara Pa1n5ca1li1 accepted
<>Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas and Pa1n5ca1li1 were given the
<>Kumbhaka1ra mandira (the Palace of Kumbhaka1ra) which
<>stood in the city of Drupada, to stay for that night.
<>Though the Pa1n2d2avas were in the guise of Bra1hman2as,
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna had his own doubts about their identity. [Page234-b+ 61]
<>So he hid himself somehwere in the Palace and kept an
<>eye on them. This shows his peculiar trait of obser-
<>vation. After this he returned to his Palace and
<>pacified his father who had been much worried about
<>his daughter's selection.
<NI>Next, we see Dhr2s2t2adyumna, during the time of the
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas. He consoled Pa1n5ca1li1, who
<>was miserable. After that he took the sons of Pa1n5ca1li1,
<>to his house. While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the
<>forest ‘Ka1myaka’, Dhr2s2t2adyumna visited them. The
<>forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas came to an end. A battle
<>between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas became inevi-
<>table. Then the Pa1n2davas selected Dhr2s2t2adyumna, as
<>the commander-in-general of their army. He ordered
<>for a general parade of the army and gave them
<>instructions. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 166 to 195;
<>the whole of Sabha1 Parva; Vana Parva, Chapters, 12, 22
<>and 51; Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 72; Udyoga Parva,

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} (See the genealogy of Arjuna).
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} S4antanu, a king of the Lunar dynasty, had
<>two wives Gan3ga1 and Satyavati1. Ga1n3ga1, gave birth to
<>eight sons. But seven of them were thrown into the
<>river Gan3ga1. Giving the eighth son Bhi1s2ma to S4antanu
<>Gan3ga1 disappeared. S4antanu then married Satyavati1,
<>a fisher-woman. Satyavati1 gave birth to two sons, Cit-
<>ra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya. When S4antanu grew old,
<>Citra1n3gada was anointed as King, as Bhi1s2ma had taken
<>Brahmavrata (vow of celibacy). Once when Citra1n3-
<>gada went to the forest for hunting, a Gandharva of the
<>name Citra1n3gada killed him. So Vicitravi1rya became
<>the King of Hastina1pura. Bhi1s2ma took the three daugh-
<>ters of the King of Ka1s4i, Amba1, Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 [Page236-a+ 65]
<>by force into his chariot and brought the last two, to
<>Hastina1pura to be given as wives to Vicitravi1rya. On
<>the way he sent Amba1 back. Vicitravi1rya married Am-
<>bika1 and Amba1lika1. But shortly after that he also died,
<>before any children were born to him. Fearing that the
<>Lunar dynasty would come to an end, Satyavati1 brought
<>her son Vedavya1sa, who was born to her from hermit
<>Para1s4ara, before her marriage, to Hastina1pura. In the
<>night Satyavati1 sent Ambika1 adorned with ornaments
<>and costly garments, to the bedroom of Vya1sa. But she
<>could not bear to lie with Vya1sa who was clad in barks
<>of the tree and wearing matted hair. Still thinking that
<>it was not right on her part to stand against the wish of
<>her mother, she approached Vya1sa and lay with him
<>with closed eyes. Ambika1 became pregnant. The child
<>she gave birth to, was blind. That child was Dhr2tara1s2t2r2a.
<>Next night Amba1lika1 approached Vya1sa. When she
<>saw Vya1sa she turned pale at his uncouth figure and
<>her face became bloodless. So the child born to her was
<>pale and was called Pa1n2d2u. Next night the maid of the
<>queen approached Vya1sa with a joyful heart and so she
<>got Vidura as son, who was extremely wise and intelli-
<>gent. Thus Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura became sons
<>of the same father.
<F>1. It is stated in M.B. A1s4ramava1sika Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 7 that Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born as the incarnation of a Gandharva
<>having the name Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (See under Dhr2tara1s2t2ra III).</F> (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters, 63
<>and 105).
<NI>3) {%Up to marriage.%} After the birth of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra Vya1sa
<>returned to forest and since then Bhi1s2ma stood in place
<>of father to the children. Bhi1s2ma performed ‘Upanay-
<>ana’ (investiture with Brahma-string) and other rites
<>of the children. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and Vidura had
<>their education in Hastina1pura. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 108).
<Poem>“Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u and the wise Vidura
<>The three were brought up as sons by Bhi1s2ma,
<>They became well educated, cultured and devotional,
<>Respectful towards vows and fasts, and
<>of good physique earnest in work
<>And they became valiant youths.
<>Learned the Vedas and Veda of archery,
<>Clubbing, shield and swords play,
<>Elephant-keeping, laws of chastisement,
<>Veda s4a1stras, allied works and epics and the Pura1n2as,
<>Pa1n2d2u came out expert archer,
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra the strongest of all.
<>None in the three worlds was equal to Vidura,
<>In wisdom and knowledge and righteousness.”
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 109).</Poem>
<NI>Because of his blindness Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was not anointed
<>as King. It is stated in M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 108
<>Stanza 25, that in the place of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Pa1n2d2u was
<>anointed the King.
<NI>4) {%Marriage and birth of children.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came of
<>marriageable age. Bhi1s2ma had heard about Ga1ndha1ri1,
<>daughter of Subala, the King of Ga1ndha1ra, as a beauti-
<>ful damsel of good qualities. Moreover she had acquired
<>a boon from S4iva that hundred sons would be born to
<>her. Bhi1s2ma sent a messenger to Subala with a request
<>to give Ga1ndha1ri1 as wife to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Subala was
<>not much pleased at the aspect of getting a blind man
<>as son-in-law. Still he thought of the prestige his family
<>would get by a marriage alliance with the kings of the
<>Pu1ru Dynasty, and finally agreed. Ga1ndha1ri1 submitted
<>to the will of her father, and to live with a husband who [Page236-b+ 63]
<>was blind. She tied her eyes with a cloth. S4akuni the
<>son of Subala brought Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1pura, and
<>gave her to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. With the sanction of Bhi1s2ma
<>their marriage took place.
<NI>Once Ga1ndha1ri1 feasted Vya1sa who came tired with hun-
<>ger and thirst. The hermit was pleased with her and
<>blessed her to have hundred sons. Ga1ndha1ri1 became
<>pregnant. But even after two years no delivery took place.
<>She crushed her womb by force and a lump of flesh
<>came out. At that time Vya1sa came there. He cut the
<>lump into hundred pieces and kept them in ghee-pots.
<>Gandha1ri1 had a desire to get a daughter also. Vya1sa
<>who had known it had cut the lump in such a way that
<>there was a small piece in excess. The pots broke by
<>themselves in due course and hundred sons and a
<>daughter were born. The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1.
<>A son named Yuyutsu also was born to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of a
<>Vais4ya woman. Duryodhana was the eldest of the
<>hundred sons. The children grew up. Dus4s4ala1 was
<>given in marriage to Jayadratha, the King of Sindhu.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 109 to 116).
<NI>5) {%Till Bha1rata-battle.%} At this juncture Pa1n2d2u incurred
<>a curse from a hermit that he would die if his wife tou-
<>ched him. With that Pa1n2d2u retired to forest with his
<>wives. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved at the separation of
<>his brother. Pa1n2d2u died in the forest and Ma1dri1 jumped
<>into fire and died with her husband. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra asked
<>Vidura to perform their cremation rites. After that
<>Yudhis2t2hira became King. The Pa1n2d2avas became more
<>and more prosperous. This made the heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>cloudy. He gave sanction to Duryodhana to transfer the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to the lac house in Va1ran2a1vata. The lac house
<>caught fire and it was rumoured that the Pa1n2d2avas died
<>in the lac house fire, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra shed crocodile
<>tears, and ordered for the mourning and oblation to
<>be performed. After the marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1, it came to
<>be known that the Pa1n2d2avas were alive and that they
<>were living with Drupada. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra recalled them and
<>gave them half of the country. The Pa1n2d2avas made
<>Indraprastha their capital and began to rule the king-
<>dom. Yudhis2t2hira performed the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(royal consecration). Dhr2tara1s2t2ra also took part in the
<>sacrifice.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge Yudhis2t2hira to a
<>game of dice. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed but advised Duryo-
<>dhana not to live in enmity with the Pa1n2d2avas. The
<>game of dice was played, and Yudhis2t2hira lost every-
<>thing the Pa1n2d2avas had. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called Pa1n5ca1li1
<>and told her that she might ask any boon. She request-
<>ed that her husband Dharmaputra might b{??} exempt-
<>ed from servitude and the Pa1n2d2avas made free. Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra compelled her to ask for more boons. She replied
<>that according to law Vais4yas were eligible for one boon,
<>Ks2atriya women two boons, Kings three boons and
<>Bra1hman2as hundred boons, and since she had already
<>taken two boons, she wanted no more. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra who
<>was pleased at this reply gave the Pa1n2d2avas freedom
<>and returned all their lost wealth.
<NI>Duryodhana wanted to challenge the Pa1n2d2avas for a
<>game of dice again. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra agreed. This time also
<>Yudhis2t2hira lost the game. The Pa1n2d2avas who had lost
<>everything, were ordered to go to forest for twelve years
<>and to live incognito for one year. The Pa1n2d2avas went [Page237-a+ 65]
<>to the forest with Pa1n5ca1li1. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved.
<NI>After thirteen years the Pa1n2d2avas returned. Duryo-
<>dhana said that not an inch of land would be given to
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra felt sorry at this S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>came to talk about conciliation. Duryodhana wanted to
<>take him a prisoner. But Dhr2tara1s2t2ra opposed it. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a showed Dhr2tara1s2t2ra his Vis4varu1pa (cosmic form)
<>to see which, Kr2s2n2a gave him sight for the time being
<>for which Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was very thankful. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas came to Kuruks2etra for Bha1rata-battle.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra called San5jaya to him and asked him about
<>the preparations the parties had made for war. San5jaya
<>gave a true description of the battle arrays of both
<>parties. (M.B. A1di Parva. Sabha1 Parva, Vana Parva,
<>and Udyoga Parva).
<NI>(6) {%Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and the battle of Bha1rata.%} The terrible
<>battle began. The heart of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was grieved with
<>sorrow. When Arjuna vowed that he would kill Jaya-
<>dratha, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra cried aloud. When he knew that
<>S4a1tyaki had destroyed the army of the Kauravas he
<>became dumb with grief. He praised Bhi1ma's valour
<>and blamed his sons. When San5jaya told him
<>about the fall of Karn2a, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra fell down
<>unconscious. He rose up again and attended to the
<>noises from the battlefield. He fell down again when
<>he knew that S4alya and Duryodhana were killed. He
<>rose again and cried for a long time. He gathered the
<>women-folk, his people and went to the battlefield.
<>He broke the metal statue of Bhi1ma and embraced the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He asked Yudhis2t2hira to do the mourning
<>and offerings for the dead. It was done accordingly.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas respected Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. But Bhi1ma
<>scolded them. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 were greatly
<>depressed and asked Yudhis2t2hira to permit them to live
<>in forest. Yudhis2t2hira tried to prevent it. He kissed on
<>the head of Yudhis2t2hira. Seeing that they did not eat
<>food he asked them to eat. Yudhis2t2hira saw that they
<>would eat only if he permitted them to live in forest.
<>At last Yudhis2t2hira agreed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted
<>money from Dharmaputra and performed mourning
<>and offerings for the dead on a large scale (M.B. Dron2a
<>Parva, Karn2a Parva, Stri1 Parva, S4a1nti Parva and

<HI>DHRUVA. I.
<NI>1) {%Birth and childhood.%} Manu Sva1yambhuva the son of
<>Brahma1, had two sons named Priyavrata and Utta1na-
<>pa1da. They were mighty heroes and of righteous
<>character. Utta1napa1da had two wives, Suruci and
<>Suni1ti. Suruci gave birth to Uttama and Suni1ti to
<>Dhruva. Utta1napa1da showed more favour towards
<>Uttama and Suruci. But he looked upon Dhruva and
<>his mother with disfavour.
<NI>Once Uttama sat on the lap of his father when the
<>latter was sitting on the throne. Seeing this, Dhruva
<>wanted to sit along with his brother. But fearing the
<>displeasure of Suruci, who was also there, the King did
<>not take Dhruva on to his lap. Seeing the endeavour of
<>Dhruva, Suruci said to him, “Child, if you wish to sit
<>on the lap of your father, you ought to have been born
<>in my womb. You cherish high ambition which you do
<>not deserve.” These words of Suruci were not palatable
<>to Dhruva who ran to his mother and sat on her lap.
<>When Suni1ti knew what had happened she shed tears.
<>After a few moments Dhruva stood up and made a
<>vow. “I will get a position unattainable even for my [Page238-b+ 65]
<>father, by my own endeavour.” He then started for the
<>forest. He attained self-renunciation even in childhood
<>becoming a disciple of hermits and performing severe
<>penance.
<NI>Dhruva began penance in the forest of Madhuvana on
<>the river Jamuna1. Suni1ti came and tried to take him to
<>the palace. But he did not return. He intensified his pena-
<>nce more and more. At last Maha1vis2n2u appeared before
<>him. Dhruva requested for a lofty, and eternal place
<>which would become a prop of the world. Accordingly,
<>Vis2n2u pointed out to Dhruva, a noble place, higher
<>than the planets, stars Saptars2is (Ursa Major) and the
<>devas who travelled in aeroplanes. Maha1vis2n2u said
<>that Dhruva would live in a lofty place as a star till
<>the end of the Kalpa and his mother Suni1ti would also
<>remain as a star near S4iva as long as Dhruva lived
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapters 11 and 12).
<NI>2) {%The previous birth of Dhruva.%} Maha1vis2n2u appeared
<>before Dhruva and revealed his previous birth.
<NI>Dhruva was a Brahmin in his previous birth. He used
<>to meditate on Vis2n2u with concentration of mind. In
<>course of time he befriended a prince who was a youth,
<>of beautiful and bright complexion, enjoying all the
<>pleasures of the world. Attracted by the position and
<>status of the prince, the Brahmin wanted to become a
<>prince. Maha1vis2n2u granted his wish. Accordingly
<>Dhruva took his next birth as the son of Utta1napa1da.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a 1, Chapter 12).
<NI>3) {%The reign and end of Dhruva.%} After receiving the boon
<>from Maha1vis2n2u, Dhruva returned. All who were there
<>embraced Dhruva. Years passed by. Utta1napa1da left
<>his kingdom to Dhruva and became a forest house-
<>holder. Dhruva became King. The King Dhruva
<>married Bra1hmi1, the daughter of S4is4uma1ra a Praja1pati.
<>The queen gave birth to two sons Kalpa and Vatsara.
<>Dhruva married Ila1 the daughter of Va1yu (wind). She
<>gave birth to a son named Utkala.
<NI>Uttama remained unmarried. While he was hunting in
<>the forest a Yaks2a (a demi-god) killed him. Suruci was
<>caught in wild fire and died. Hearing about the death
<>of Uttama, Dhruva took his weapons and reached the
<>realm of the Yaks2as. He stood at their gate and
<>challenged them for battle. One lac and thirty thousand
<>Yaks2a warriors fought with Dhruva. Dhruva destroyed
<>the entire army. The Yaks2as began illusive and
<>magical arts. Dhruva overcame that also. At last
<>Kubera himself appeared before Dhruva and blessed
<>him. They got him into a plane and placed him in a
<>place higher than all the planets. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%The descendants of Dhruva.%} Two sons named S4is2t2i and
<>Bhavya were born to Dhruva by his wife S4ambhu.
<>Succha1ya1 the wife of S4is2t2i gave birth to five sinless sons
<>named Ripu, Ripun5jaya, Vipra, Vr2kala and Vr2katejas.
<>Br2hati1 the wife of Ripu gave birth to Ca1ks2us2a of extreme
<>bright complexion. Manu was born to Ca1ks2us2a by his
<>wife Pus2karan2i1 the daughter of Vi1ran2apraja1pati and in-
<>cluded in the children of Varun2a. Ten sons were born
<>to the bright Manu by his wife Nad2vala1, daughter
<>of Praja1pati Vaira1ja. These ten bright sons were Kuru,
<>Pu1ru, S4atadyumna Tapasvi1, Satyava1n, S4uci, Agnis2-
<>t2oma1, Atira1tra, Sudyumna, and Abhimanyu. A1gneyi1,
<>the wife of Kuru gave birth to six children.
<>They were An3ga, Sumanas, Khya1ti, Kratu, An3giras
<>and S4ibi. A son named Vena was born to An3ga [Page239-a+ 63]
<>by his wife Suni1tha1. Hermits churned the right hand
<>of Vena to obtain children. As a result of churning
<>Vaineya was born from the right hand of Vena. That
<>King is the famous Pr2thu. This Pr2thu milked the earth
<>for the prosperity of his subjects. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3s4a
<>1, Chapter 13).
<NI>5) {%The place of Dhruva.%} The origin of the river Gan3ga1
<>was through the hole at the top of the shell of the
<>mundane egg. It flowed down and fell on the highest
<>part of heaven. That place is called Vis2n2upa1da. Sitting
<>in this Vis2n2upa1da, Dhruva does penance to Vis2n2u. So
<>this place got the name Dhruvaman2d2ala. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 8).
<HI>DHRUVA II. He was the son of Nahus2a and the brother
<>of Yaya1ti. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 75, Stanza 30)

<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 75).
<HI>DHRUVARATNA. An attendant of Subrahman2ya. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 4).
<HI>DHRUVASANDHI. A king of Kosala. During the reign
<>of this King there was prosperity in Ayodhya1 and the
<>people were virtuous. This king had two wives
<>Manorama1 and Li1la1vati1. A son named Sudars4ana was
<>born to Manorama1. After a month the second wife
<>also gave birth to a son named S4atrujit. The King was
<>much pleased and both sons were brought up alike.
<>As S4atrujit was cleverer than Sudars4ana people loved
<>S4atrujit more.
<NI>Once Dhruvasandhi went to the forest for hunt-
<>ing and was killed by a lion in the forest. Accord-
<>ing to the custom Sudars4ana became King. Li1la1-
<>vati1, the mother of S4atrujit was the daughter of the
<>King of Ujjayini1. Her desire was to make S4atrujit the
<>King. Manorama1. the mother of Sudars4ana was the
<>daughter of the King of Kalin3ga. Hearing about the
<>death of Dhruvasandhi, the kings of Ujjayini1 and
<>Kalin3ga arrived at Ayodhya1. The King of Ujjayini1
<>got angry because Sudars4ana was made king and
<>began war. The King of Kalin3ga took the side of
<>Sudars4ana. A terrible battle was fought in Ayodhya1
<>as to who should be the heir to the throne. In the
<>battle Yudha1jit, the King of Ujjayini1, killed Vi1rasena,
<>the king of Kalin3ga. Sudars4ana and his mother
<>Manorama1 were in a sorry plight. According to the
<>advice of minister Vidulla, Manorama1 and Sudars4ana
<>fled from the capital. Vidulla and the maid of
<>Manorama1 accompanied them. In two days they
<>reached Gan3ga1tat2a. They were caught by fishermen
<>thieves and they lost everything they had. At last with
<>the help of a boat they crossed the Ganges and reached
<>Triku1t2a. They went to the hermitage of Bharadva1ja [Page239-b+ 64]
<>who was doing penance there. He gave them protec-
<>tion.
<NI>After making S4atrujjit King, Yudha1jit began to search
<>for Manorama1 and Sudars4ana. He got news that they
<>lived in Citraku1t2a. Yudha1jit went there with an army.
<>But he could not get them out of the hermitage of
<>Bharadva1ja. Manorama1 and Sudars4ana lived safely in
<>the hermitage.
<NI>Once Vidulla came to the hermitage of Bharadva1ja to
<>enquire about Manorama1. Seeing the old man the
<>hermit boys called out “Kli1ba Kli1ba.” Prince Sudars4ana
<>heard only “Kli1”. The syllable ‘Kli1’ is the spell called
<>‘Ka1mara1ja bi1jamantra’. Without knowing its meaning
<>Sudars4ana called out ‘Kli1’ several times. With that the
<>prince got a special power.
<NI>Six more years passed. The prince became eleven years
<>old. By this time Bharadva1ja had taught the prince
<>Vedas, S4a1s4tras, etc. The prince was a devotee of Devi1.
<>Devi1 appeared before him and gave him a bow and a
<>quiver which would never become empty, and an
<>impenetrable armour. Sudars4ana married S4as4ikala1 the
<>daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1. Nis2a1da, the King of
<>S4r2n3giverapura, was a friend of Dhruvasandhi. He gave
<>Sudars4ana a chariot which Sudars4ana rode through the
<>forest. With the help of the King of Ka1s4i1 and others
<>Sudars4ana recaptured Ayodhya1. He made Vidulla his
<>minister and ruled over the country for a long time.

<NI>Brahma1 was born in the lotus from the navel of Vis2n2u,
<>who was lying in meditation on the surface of water.
<>From the ear-wax of Vis2n2u two asuras--Madhu and
<>Kait2abha sprang up. They terrified Brahma1 by sha-
<>king the stalk of the lotus. Brahma1 became terribly
<>afraid of the asuras and ran about on the surface of
<>water. Hearing the cry of Brahma1 Vis2n2u awoke, but
<>he could not defeat the asuras. Vis2n2u decided to
<>employ ‘Sa1ma’ (conciliation) the first expedient. The
<>arrogant demons ordered Vis2n2u to ask of them any
<>boon. Vis2n2u replied. “If it is so, you must be killed by
<>me.” They could not but give the boon. They agreed
<>to the request of Vis2n2u and said: “But we must be
<>killed in an atmosphere, which is not cloudy.” Vis2n2u
<>killed them when the atmosphere was clear.
<NI>A son named Dhundhu had been born to Madhu and
<>Kait2abha. Because Vis2n2u had killed his fathers
<>Dhundhu decided to take revenge on Vis2n2u and the
<>Gods. With this idea in view Dhundhu began to do
<>penance in the sandy desert of Ujja1laka in Marudhanva.

<>this boon, he lived under sand in the desert of Ujja1laka.
<>His idea was to destroy the gods.
<NI>A hermit named Uttan3ka had erected his hermitage in
<>another part of Marudhanva and began penance. By his

<HI>DHYA1NA. (Meditation). Even from ancient times the
<>people of Bha1rata believed that heaven could be attain-
<>ed by meditation. There are scientific methods of
<>meditating upon God. They are described below:
<NI>The root “dhyai”, means “to think”. Dhya1na (medi-
<>tation) means thinking of God with concentration.
<>God is invisible and figureless. We can meditate only
<>upon some material that contains the attributes of God.
<>So dhya1na (meditation) is to fix the mind on the
<>object of meditation, and to imagine that particular
<>object in a particular place and to concentrate the
<>mind upon it. One who casts off his body, while engag-
<>ed in meditation attains ‘Sa1yujya’ (oneness with God). [Page241-a+ 64]
<NI>He who can meditate upon God, with concentration
<>of mind even for a moment or two can attain heaven.
<>The fruits he attains are far greater than the fruits
<>attained by performing great sacrifices and offerings.
<>For meditation, there are four factors: Dhya1ta1 (the
<>meditator), Dhya1na (the act of meditation) Dhyeya
<>(the object meditated upon) and Dhya1naprayojana
<>(the attainment by meditation). He who indulges in
<>meditation is the meditator. The act done by him is
<>meditation. That which is meditated upon is the object
<>of meditation. What the meditator obtains as a result
<>of his meditation is the attainment. A meditator should
<>be wise and virtuous, should have attention and patie-
<>nce, devoted to Vis2n2u and always energetic.
<NI>We can meditate upon God, walking, standing, sleeping
<>and awake. God should be consecrated in the centre of
<>the lotus chair of the heart and be worshipped with de-
<>votional meditation. It is to give practice in fixing the
<>mind firmly on a particular object, that the sages say
<>that some visible material object should be given to
<>meditate upon, in the early stage of meditation. When
<>concentration of mind is obtained by meditating upon
<>a visible object, it will be possible for us to meditate
<>upon an object which is not amenable to our senses.
<>When engaged in meditation we should be thinking
<>“Aham3 Brahma1 jyotira1tma1 va1sudevo vimukta Om3”. (I
<>am Brahma1, the light, the Spirit, Va1sudeva, and Vimukta
<>(having no connection with anything), OM). (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 374).
<HI>D2IBHAKA. A prince who, puffed up by the power of
<>boons and blessings from the gods, tried to harm sage
<>Durva1sas. Balabhadrara1ma killed him. The following
<>account occurs in the Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a.
<NI>Brahmadatta, King of Sa1lva, had two wives. No chil-
<>dren were born to them for several years. Brahmadatta's
<>minister, Mitrasaha, also had no children. Mitrasaha
<>was a brahmin and a scholar. On his advice, Brahma-
<>datta, with his wives, went to Kaila1sa and performed
<>tapas to please S4iva to get children. As a result of ten
<>years’ rigorous tapas S4iva was pleased and blessed
<>him that two sons would be born to him. Later his
<>wives gave birth to two sons. The son of the eldest
<>queen was named Ham3sa and that of the second queen
<>was named D2ibhaka. At this time a son was also born
<>to Mitrasaha, the minister by the blessing of Vis2n2u. That
<>child was named Jana1rdana.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka were spoilt, but Jana1rdana was
<>a bhakta of Vis2n2u. Ham3sa and D2ibhaka performed
<>tapas in their childhood to please S4iva and got invinci-
<>ble power and arrows. After that they became loka-
<>kan2t2akas (torturers) and went round the world. Once
<>they went to Kas4yapa's a1s4rama and destroyed the place
<>of worship. After that they went to the a1s4rama of
<>Durva1sas. There they tortured the sages and made the
<>sages naked who were wearing only loin cloth. Then
<>they returned.
<NI>Enraged by these, sage Durva1sas went to Dva1raka1
<>taking the destroyed loin-cloth and other articles. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a and his courtiers stood up and saluted him when
<>they saw Durva1sas coming like sam3ha1rarudra. On
<>hearing the news, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a assured him that he would
<>kill Ham3sa and D2ibhaka and sent him back pacified.
<NI>Ham3sa and D2ibhaka began a ra1jasu1ya. They sent
<>Jana1rdana to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a with the message that he should [Page241-b+ 63]
<>either fight with them or give them tribute (in the
<>form of money). Jana1rdana went to Dva1raka1, just as
<>Akru1ra, a devotee of Vis2n2u, went to Amba1d2i with the
<>message of Kam3sa. Immediately Kr2s2n2a and Balabhadra
<>with the chief Ministers like Sa1tyaki went to Sa1lva. In
<>the war that followed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a killed Ham3sa and Bala.
<>Bhadrara1ma killed D2ibhaka. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva,

<HI>DI1KS2A1. Di1ks2a1 is the vrata that expels sin and increases
<>Jn5a1na (wisdom). Those who are to be blessed fall into
<>three categories. The person who belongs to the first
<>category is called Vijn5a1nakala; the second is Pralaya-
<>kala; and the third is Sakala. Vijn5a1nakala is free from
<>sin alone. Pralayakala is free from sins and Karmans.
<>Sakala has everything from Kala1 to the earth. The
<>Di1ks2a1s to be practised by the three classes of persons
<>are of different kinds. Di1ks2a1 is classified into two:
<>“Nira1dha1ra and Sa1dha1ra.
<NI>Nira1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is performed for the sake of Vijn5a1na-
<>kala and Pralayakala. Sa1dha1ra Di1ks2a1 is prescribed for
<>the third class of people, the Sakalas.
<HI>DILI1PA I. (Khat2va1n3ga). A mighty king of the Iks2va1ku
<>dynasty.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See Das4aratha's Genealogy.
<NI>2) {%Reign and Birth of Son.%} Dili1pa is counted as one of the
<>noblest kings. His reign was extremely popular. But
<>even after a long period of married life, he had no
<>issue. His queen was Sudaks2in2a1, the princess of Maga-
<>dha. In order to get Vasis2t2ha's advice, Dili1pa and
<>Sudaks2in2a1 went to the sage's a1s4rama. After hearing
<>about their grievance, Vasis2t2ha meditated for a little
<>while and described why the royal couple were not
<>blessed with children:--“Long ago, Dili1pa had paid
<>a visit to Indra. While returning after the visit, he
<>passed by Ka1madhenu who was lying under the shade of
<>Kalpavr2ks2a. He paid no heed to her, as he did not
<>see her. The divine cow (Ka1madhenu) took this as
<>a personal slight to her and cursed the King that he
<>would not have children until he served and propitiat-
<>ed her daughter, Nandini1. Neither the King nor his
<>charioteer was aware of the curse. Ka1madhenu has
<>now gone to Pa1ta1la (underworld) to attend a sacrifice
<>of Varun2a. Therefore Dili1pa and his queen should
<>attend on and propitiate her daughter, Nandini1.”
<NI>From the next morning the King and queen began to
<>offer their services to Nandini1. The King followed her
<>as her shadow. After twentyone days, one morning
<>Nandini1 went to graze in a dense forest. As usual, the
<>King also followed her. As they reached the middle
<>of the woods, the King was enchanted for a moment
<>by the charm of the Sylvan scenery. Just then, on
<>turning round he saw a lion springing towards Nandini1
<>to prey upon her. Suddenly he took up his bow and
<>aimed an arrow at the lion, but to his great amaze-
<>ment, his hands were paralysed. The lion spoke to him
<>as follows:--“O King, you need not exert yourself in
<>vain. I am the servant of Lord S4iva. This holy deodar [Page242-a+ 64]
<>tree which you see in front of us, was planted and
<>tended by Pa1rvati1. My task is to protect this tree.
<>Pa1rvati1 and lord S4iva have authorized me to kill and
<>eat the animals which come this way. Therefore this
<>cow is my food.”
<NI>The king was in a fix. He begged the lion to spare
<>Nandini1 and to eat his (king's) body instead. The
<>lion agreed. The King put down his arms and stood
<>bowing down in front of the lion. Hearing the words,
<>“Beloved child, arise” he looked up, and the lion had
<>vanished. Just then Nandini1 told him that it was she
<>herself who had done this to test him. The King and
<>Nandini1 then returned to the A1s4rama. As a result of
<>Nandini1's blessing, the King's wife bore a son who
<>later became the celebrated emperor Raghu. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 198).
<NI>(3) {%Killing of the Asura, Vi1rasena.%} Once a powerful Asura
<>named Vi1rasena attacked Vais4ravan2a. When lord
<>S4iva came to know of it he tried to defeat Vi1rasena,
<>but in vain. At S4iva's request, Maha1vis2n2u entered the
<>scene. He was also unable to subdue the Asura.
<>Vis2n2u advised Vais4ravan2a to seek the help of Dili1pa.
<>Dili1pa went to Alaka1puri1 and encountered Vi1rasena.
<>Under the shower of arrows fram Dili1pa, blood began
<>to flow from the body of Vi1rasena. But each drop of
<>his blood came to life as a new Vi1rasena and all those
<>Vi1rasenas continued a ceaseless battle with Dili1pa.
<>At last Dili1pa prayed to Raktes4vari1 who suddenly
<>appeared and drank all the blood. In this way the king
<>managed to kill Vi1rasena. (Kampa Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(4) {%Dili1pa and the Holy Waters.%} Once king Dili1pa led
<>a saintly life on the bank of Gan3ga1, the sacred place
<>worshipped by Devas, R2s2is and Gandharvas. With
<>religious practices and offering pu1ja1 to Devas, R2s2is
<>and Pitr2s, he spent time in prayer and meditation.
<>One day he happened to meet Vasis2t2ha, and paid
<>homage to him. The sage Vasis2t2ha described to him
<>all the places of sacred waters and explained the great-
<>ness of each. (See under Khat2va1n3ga). (Padma Pura1n2a,

<HI>DILI1PA1S4RAMA. A sacred place. It was at this place
<>that Amba1, the daughter of the King of Ka1s4i1 performed
<>austere tapas (Penance). (See under Amba1).
<HI>D2IM3D2IKA. A rat who played a part in Bid2a1lopa1khya1na.
<>The story runs as follows:
<NI>Once a cat performed tapas, holding his hands up, on
<>the banks of the Ganges, when the found no way to get
<>food. Seeing the devotion of that cat all living beings
<>birds and animals began to worship him. Once the cat
<>called all rats and told them: “One cannot do spiritual
<>and physical deeds at the same time. So I will look after
<>your spiritual affairs. You should attend to my
<>physical needs. That is, bring me food, bathe me in
<>the Ganges, all these are your duties.”
<NI>The rats agreed to do so. They took him to the
<>Ganges, bathed him and gave him food. But, the cat,
<>whenever he got a chance caught a rat and ate it up
<>The cat's health improved day-by-day and the number
<>of rat's began to decrease. Among them, there was a
<>clever rat named D2imd2ika. He called all the other rats [Page242-b+ 65]
<>and organized a secret conference. The subject of
<>discussion was the cruel deeds done by the cat to the
<>rats.
<NI>The next day D2im3d2ika went secretly to examine the
<>ways of living of the cat. The cat ate D2im3d2ika. After
<>40 days the rats came to know that D2im3d2ika was
<>missing. They assembled secretly. They elected a rat
<>named Kokila as their leader. Under his leadership
<>the rats declared independence and left the place. The
<>cat also went his own way finding no means to get food.

<HI>DIN3NA1GA. A Sanskrit dramatist who lived between the
<>second and fifth centuries A.D. “Dhi1rana1ga” was his
<>other name. The Sanskrit drama “KUNDAMA1LA1”
<>which is based on Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a and has six acts,
<>was composed by Din3na1ga. Din3na1ga, the Buddhist pre-
<>acher and this Din3na1ga are two different persons.
<>Vina1yaka1 and S4iva are praised in the introductory stan-
<>zas of Kundama1la1 (A.B. Keith: Classical Sanskrit
<>literature).
<HI>DI1NANA1THA. A King who lived in Dva1para Age. He
<>was a mighty and famous Vais2n2ava. But his childless
<>life distressed him very much. Once he consulted
<>Ga1lava about his plight. Ga1lava assured him that if he
<>performed a human sacrifice, a son would be born to
<>him. A handsome, scholarly and highly-born man was
<>to be sacrificed into the fire, A cripple, a dark-skinned
<>man or a crude fellow was unsuitable for the purpose.
<>The King's servants scoured the villages and towns
<>looking for such a perfect man, but in vain. At last
<>they reached a country called Das4apura, inhabited by
<>noble Bra1hman2as. The women of that place were
<>reputed for their charming eyes. No man could resist
<>their fascination. In that lovely city there lived a
<>Bra1hman2a named Kr2s2n2adeva with his virtuous wife and
<>three sons. The King's servants requested Kr2s2n2adeva
<>to give one of his sons to be sacrificed. They offered
<>four lakhs of gold coins as price. The Bra1hman2a and
<>his wife cried bitterly and Kr2s2n2adeva offered himself
<>instead of his sons. The royal servants seized one of his
<>sons after throwing gold coins in the house and
<>prepared to take him away. At this stage the second
<>son of Kr2s2n2adeva came forward and volunteered
<>himself. They agreed and he accompanied them to the
<>palace. On their way they met the sage Vis4va1mitra.
<>He asked them to release the boy but they refused to
<>set him free. The sage followed them to the palace and
<>undertook to perform a sacrifice which would bless the
<>King with progeny without a human sacrifice. The
<>King accepted the offer and thus the boy was saved.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 12).
<HI>DI1PAKARN2I. A character in Gun2a1d2hya's Br2hatkatha1.
<>Di1pakarn2i was a King. He had a wife named
<>S4aktimati1. One day while she was sleeping in the gar-
<>den she was bitten by a snake and she died. Distressed
<>by her departure, Di1pakarn2i accepted Brahmacarya.
<>He was deeply grieved because he had no son to
<>succeed to his throne. One day S4iva appeared to him
<>in a dream and told him thus:--“When you pass
<>through the forest, you will come across a youth riding
<>a lion. Take him to your palace; he will be your son.”
<NI>Di1pakarn2i woke up happily. He had faith in his dream.
<>One day he went to a distant forest for hunting.
<>There he saw a very handsome boy riding on a lion.
<>He was reminded of his dream when the boy dismounted [Page243-a+ 62]
<>and the lion walked away slowly to a nearby stream to
<>drink water. At once Di1pakarn2i shot an arrow at the
<>lion. Suddenly the lion gave up its animal shape and
<>transformed itself into a man and spoke to the King as
<>follows:--
<NI>I am a Yaks2a named Sa1ta and a friend of Vais4ravan2a.
<>Once when I went to bathe in the river Gan3ga1, I
<>happened to see a R2s2i virgin and I fell in love with her.
<>I married her according to the Ga1ndharva rules. The
<>R2s2is who came to know of it turned us into a lion
<>couple by their curse. When we fell at their feet and
<>begged pardon, they gave her a blessing that a son
<>would be born to her and that I would fall under your
<>arrow. After that we were wandering about as a
<>lion-couple and in due course she became pregnant.
<>In the fullness of time she gave birth to this boy and
<>then was liberated from the curse. I have been bringing
<>him up by giving the milk of lionesses. Now, by being
<>hit by your arrow, I am also released from the curse.
<>From this time kindly receive this mighty youth as
<>your own.”
<NI>After saying this, the Yaks2a vanished. Di1pakarn2i
<>returned to the palace, taking the boy with him. Since
<>he was carried by Sa1ta, the boy was named “Sa1tava1-
<>hana”. When he grew up into a youth, Di1pakarn2i
<>handed over the rule of the kingdom to him and
<>entered into Va1naprastha. In course of time Sa1tava1hana
<>became an emperor. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2ha

<>once won him over to his side by persuasive speech.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 30, verse 2).
<HI>DI1RGHA1YUS. Brother of S4ruta1yus, the King of Kalin3ga.
<>Arjuna killed him in the war. (M.B. Dron2a Parva,
<>Chapter 94, Verse 29).
<HI>DI1RGHIKA1 A daughter of Vis4vakarman. She was
<>abnormally tall, and since there was the S4a1stric injun-
<>ction that he who married such women would die
<>within six months none came forward to wed her.
<NI>Di1rghika1 began a penance for a good husband. As it
<>continued for years together symptoms of old age began
<>to appear in her. At this juncture an old and ailing
<>householder came there. On certain conditions he
<>married Di1rghika1. After sometime, in obedience to the
<>husband's wisn Di1rghika1 set out on a tour carrying him
<>on her shoulders. Though Ma1n2d2avya cursed her hus-
<>band on their way, due to the chastity of Di1rghika1 the
<>curse proved to be ineffective. The similarity in the
<>stories of S4a1n2d2ili1 and this Di1rghika1 leads us to think
<>that they might have been one and the same person.
<HI>DIS4A1CAKS2U. One of the prominent off-springs of
<>Garud2a. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 10).
<HI>DITI.
<NI>1) {%General.%} A daughter of Daks2a Praja1pati. She was
<>married to Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci. She had many sisters, chief among whom were
<>Aditi, Ka1la1, Dana1yus, Danu, Sim3hika1, Krodha1, Pr2tha1,
<>Vis4va1, Vinata1, Kapila1, Muni and Kadru1. Kas4yapa's
<>sons by Aditi became Devas (A1diteyas) and his sons
<>by Diti became Asuras (Daityas). (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 65).
<NI>2) {%Indra cut Diti's embryo to pieces.%} Devas and Asuras
<>agreed to churn the ocean of milk as a joint endeavour.
<>But when Amr2ta rose up to the surface, they began to
<>quarrel over it. In the battle between Devas and
<>Asuras for the possession of Amr2ta, Diti's sons were
<>killed.
<NI>In her inconsolable grief at the death of her sons, Diti
<>prayed to her husband Kas4yapa that she should be
<>blessed with a brave and heroic son who would be
<>capable of killing Indra. The sage granted her the
<>boon and told her that by worshipping the lord with a
<>pure mind and body for a hundred years, she would
<>bear a son who would be mighty enough to kill Indra.
<>In due course Diti became pregnant and following her
<>husband's advice, she fervently worshipped the Lord
<>and remained pure in mind and body. When Indra
<>came to know that the child in Diti's womb was to be
<>his slayer, he approached her under the disguise of an
<>attendant, offering to serve her. He waited for an [Page244-b+ 65]
<>opportunity to get access to her and before the expiry
<>of a hundred years he got a chance. One day, Diti
<>went to bed without washing her feet and fell asleep.
<>Indra took his Vajra and gaining access to her womb
<>cut the embryo within it into seven pieces. The child
<>in the womb began to cry loudly. Indra asked it
<>“MA1 RUDA” (Do not cry). Then he proceeded to
<>cut each of the seven pieces again into seven and
<>finally there were fortynine pieces in all. They subse-
<>quently became Devas known as “Maruts.” They got
<>the name Maruts because Indra told them “Ma1 Ruda.”
<>All the fortynine Maruts later on became the helpers
<>of Indra. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter 21).
<NI>3) {%Diti's sons.%} Asuras were Diti's sons. Chief among
<>them were Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. They had
<>a sister named Sim3hika1. Hiran2yakas4ipu had four
<>sons--Anuhla1da, Hla1da, Prahla1da and Sam3hla1da who
<>were famous for their glory and might. S4u1rapadma,
<>Sim3havaktra, Ta1raka1sura, Gomukha and Aja1mukha
<>were also Diti's sons. Of them, S4u1rapadma had four
<>sons by his wife Mayasuta1, who were Bha1nukopa,
<>Agnimukha, Vajraba1hu and Hiran2ya. An asura named
<>Maha1s4u1ra was born to Sim3havaktra by his wife,
<>Vibhu1ti. The Asuras, S4ambara, S4akuni, Dvimu1rdha1,
<>S4an3ku, As4va, were the sons of Hiran2ya1ks2a. Sim3hika1
<>married Vipracitti; Ra1hu and Ketu were born to them.
<>Sam3hla1da, the son of Hiran2yakas4ipu had three sons,
<>A1yus2ma1n, S4ibi and Ba1s2kala. Virocana was the son of
<>Prahla1da; Maha1bali was the son of Virocana; Ba1n2a
<>was born to Maha1bali and to Ba1n2a were born four
<>crores of Niva1takavacas. All these were the prominent
<>children of Diti. Besides them, Diti had crores of other
<>Asuras born to her. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1, Chapter
<>3; Harivam3s4a, Chapter 3).
<NI>4) {%Birth of Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a.%} Hiran2yakas4ipu
<>and Hiran2ya1ks2a were the rebirth of Jaya and Vijaya,
<>the two gate-keepers of Maha1vis2n2u. (See under Jaya).
<>There is a story as to how they were born as the sons
<>of Diti.
<NI>Diti was one of the wives of Kas4yapa. She had no
<>children while the other wives of Kas4yapa had children.
<>Jealousy and grief rankled in her mind. One day she
<>approached Kas4yapa and pressed him to beget a son
<>for her. It was the time of dusk when Kas4yapa was
<>deeply absorbed in his day's devotional worship. She
<>disturbed his “Dhya1na” (devotional concentration) by
<>her importunity, but he was reluctant to yield to her
<>wishes at such an inauspicious time. It is at dusk that
<>S4iva goes about with his attendant hordes of spirits,
<>wearing the crown of his matted hair covered with the
<>dust carried by the whirlwinds from cremation grounds
<>and keeping his three eyes wide open. Kas4yapa asked
<>Diti to wait for a few minutes, until that terrible time
<>was over, but she did not heed his advice. In the fury
<>of her passion she sprang towards him and stripped
<>him of his clothes and in the end Kas4yapa yielded to
<>her carnal desires. But after the act he in a repentant
<>mood told her that she had defiled her mind by having
<>sexual union in that unholy hour and by doing so had
<>sinned against the gods. As a result, twin sons will be
<>born in her womb. They would persecute and torture
<>the three worlds. Maha1vis2n2u would incarnate to
<>destroy them. But since she also felt a little regret in
<>her act, a grandson of her (Prahla1da) will become a
<>devotee of Vis2n2u. [Page245-a+ 65]
<>Twin sons, Hiran2yakas4ipu and Hiran2ya1ks2a were born
<>to Diti. For the rest of the story, see under Hiran2ya-
<>kas4pu and Hiran2ya1ks2a. (Bha1gavata, Prathama Skan-
<>dha).
<NI>5) Diti flourishes in the assembly of Brahma1. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 11, verse 39.)
<HI>DIVAH2PUTRA. One of the twelve su1ryas who were
<>born in the form of the Sun. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 1, Verse 42).
<HI>DIVA1KARA I. A synonym of Su1rya (Sun).
<HI>DIVA1KARA II. A son of Garud2a. (M.B. Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 101).
<HI>DIVA1KARA III. See under Nis4a1kara II.
<HI>DIVA1KARA IV. A king. During the reign of this king
<>the Matsya Pura1n2a was composed.
<HI>DIVIRATHA I. A King born in Bharata's dynasty.
<>He was the grandson of Bharata and the son of
<>Bhumanya. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 24).
<HI>DIVIRATHA II. A king. He was the son of Dadhiva1hana.
<>In the course of Paras4ura1ma's extermination of
<>Ks2atriyas, the sage Gautama rescued a son of Diviratha
<>and gave shelter to him. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>49, Verse 80
<HI>DIVODA1SA. (ATITHIGVA). A king of Ka1s4i1.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} From Vis2n2u descended in the following
<>order:--Brahma1-Atri-Candra-Budha-Puru1ravas-
<>A1yus-Anenas-Pratiks2atra-Sr2n5jaya-Jaya-Vijaya-
<>Kr2ti-Haryas4va-Sahadeva-Nadina-Jayatsena-Sam3kr2ti-

<>tapas-Dhanvantari-Ketuma1n-Bhi1maratha-
<>Divoda1sa.
<NI>Divoda1sa's great grandfather's father, Ka1s4a had many
<>sons. They were called the Ka1s4is. It was from Ka1s4a's
<>reign that Va1ra1n2asi1 came to be called Ka1s4i1. (Hari
<>Vam3s4a, Chapter 29).
<NI>2) {%Divoda1sa's Reign.%} When Divoda1sa began his rule in
<>Va1ra1n2asi1, there was a Ra1ks2asa named Ks2emaka.
<>Divoda1sa killed him and extended his kingdom. At
<>that stage, Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehayas invaded
<>Divoda1sa. Divoda1sa killed the hundred sons of Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya. At that time the sage Kum3bhaka (Nikumbha)
<>came to Ka1s4i1. His practice was to live fora thousand
<>years at any place where he reached at the time of
<>dusk. Since he had reached Va1ra1n2asi1 at dusk, he set up
<>an a1s4rama and lived there for a thousand years. At
<>that time there was a famine in Va1ra1n2asi1. The whole
<>land was in the grip of a severe drought. Kumbhaka's
<>a1s4rama and its surroundings alone remained green and
<>cool. Herdsmen used to take cattle to graze in the
<>neighbourhood of the a1s4rama. Once when they retur-
<>ned in the evening, they took with their cows, the
<>sacrificial cow of Kumbhaka. It was dark and the sage
<>searched for the cow everywhere but could not trace
<>its whereabouts At last he came to know by intuition
<>that his cow was taken away by the herdsmen. In his
<>rage he cursed that Va1ra1n2asi1 should be ruined and left
<>the place with his disciples. (See under Kumbhaka).
<NI>The story of the ruin of Va1ra1n2asi1 in Harivam3sa is diff-
<>erent. It was the time when S4iva had married Pa1rvati1,
<>the daughter of Himava1n. After marriage S4iva shifted
<>his residence to his wife's house. S4iva whose task was
<>to look after the affairs of the world, was never availa-
<>ble for the purpose at Kaila1sa, his own seat.
<>The gods were in a helpless condition. They ap-
<>proached Pa1rvati1's mother, Mena1 and requested her [Page245-b+ 65]
<>to persuade S4iva to return to his own place by any
<>means. Mena1 called her daughter and ridiculed her
<>husband as a vagabond who had no place to lay his
<>head on. Pa1rvati1 could not bear this insult. Her mother's
<>stinging remarks got circulation in Devaloka. So she
<>urged S4iva to settle down somewhere on earth with her.
<>S4iva agreed and promised to take up residence at
<>Ka1s4i1.
<NI>The ruler of Ka1s4i1 in those days was Divoda1sa. It was
<>a prosperous period in the country. As a rule, man
<>turns to God only when faced with misfortunes. So
<>S4iva decided to bring about a famine among the people
<>of the country by ruining it. For that he sent sage
<>Kumbhaka to Va1ra1n2asi1. Kumbhaka arrived in Ka1s4i1
<>and appeared to the barber Karn2aka to whom he
<>communicated S4iva's intentions. The barber cheerfully
<>fell in with the proposal and built a temple on the
<>next day for the residence of Kumbhaka. Living in
<>the temple, Kumbhaka began to participate in the
<>spiritual matters of the people. His blessings were much
<>sought after and people came to have deep faith in
<>him.
<NI>Divoda1sa had no children. He had made many pious
<>offerings to gods and performed many holy rites for
<>removing his wife's sterility, but it was all in vain.
<>At last, at the King's suggestion, she began to offer
<>pu1ja1 to Kumbhaka praying for issue. But even after
<>a long period of devoted worship, she received no
<>blessing or boon from the sage. Moved by the pathetic
<>condition of his queen, Suyas4as, Divoda1sa reproached
<>Kumbhaka very severely. He reprimanded him for
<>denying his blessings to the queen while he was shower-
<>ing them on all and sundry in the country. Provoked
<>at the King's rebuke, Kumbhaka pronounced a curse
<>that the country should be ruined. As a result of it the
<>country began to decline. (Harivam3s4a, Chapter 29).
<NI>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 came and settled down in Va1ra1n2asi1.
<>After some years, Pa1rvati1 began to press her husband
<>to leave the place and to go somewhere else. S4iva was
<>not inclined to do so. He said the place was “Avimu-
<>kta” and therefore insisted that he would not leave
<>it. From that time the place came to be called
<>“Avimukta.”
<NI>3) Other details.
<NI>(1) Towards the end of his life Divoda1sa became a
<>Ra1jars2i (Royal Saint). There are numerous references
<>to this Ra1jars2i in the R2gveda. Since Divoda1sa was of
<>a very hospitable nature he was known by another
<>name, “Atithigva”. In R2gveda, 1st Man2d2ala, 16th
<>Anuva1ka, 127th Su1kta, we read that once he hid him-
<>self under water to escape from an Asura called
<>S4am3bara.
<NI>(2) Divoda1sa had a son named “Parucchepa”, who
<>was a R2s2i. R2gveda 1st Man2d2ala 19th Anuva1ka, 127th
<>Su1kta relates to Parucchepa.
<NI>(3) Bhi1maratha, the father of Divoda1sa, had two other
<>names, Bhi1masena, and Sudeva. Divoda1sa purchased
<>Ma1dhavi1, the daughter of Yaya1ti after paying two
<>hundred S4ya1makarn2a1s4vas (beautiful horses with dark-
<>coloured ears) to Ga1lava, so that he might have chil-
<>dren. After the birth of his children, he returned
<>Ma1dhavi1 to her father. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter
<>117).
<NI>(4) He sits in Yama's assembly and offers Pu1ja1 to
<>Yama. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 12). [Page246-a+ 65]
<NI>(5) Divoda1sa once plundered the accessories of his
<>enemies. Agnihotra vanished after it. (M.B. S4a1nti
<>Parva, Chapter 96, Verse 21).
<NI>(6) It was at the behest of Indra that Divoda1sa built
<>the city of Va1ran2asi1 (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>30, Verse 16).
<NI>(7) Once Divoda1sa fought with the King of Hehaya
<>for one thousand days. After having lost his army he went
<>to the sage Bharadva1ja and performed Putraka1mes2t2i
<>sacrifice. As a result of it a son Pratardana was born
<>to him. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>(8) Other names for Divoda1sa used in the Maha1bha1-
<>rata are--Bhaimaseni, Ka1s4i1s4a, Saudeva, Sudevatanaya
<>etc.
<NI>DIVYA1DEVI1. Daughter of Divoda1sa, King of Plaks2a-
<>dvi1pa. There is a story about this princess in Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Bhu1mikhan2d2a, Chapters 85, 88.
<NI>Divoda1sa decided to give his daughter Divya1 in
<>marriage to Citrasena, King of Ru1pades4a. But just
<>before the day fixed for the marriage Citrasena died
<>prematurely. So, as advised by the Bra1hman2as who had
<>come there she was married to Ru1pasena. He also died
<>soon after. She was subsequently married to 21 persons
<>in turn, and all of them died one by one.
<NI>Everyone took pity on her for her ill-fate. At last, at the
<>suggestion of the ministers, preparations were made for
<>her svayam3vara. Here also ill-luck pursued her. All
<>the princes who arrived to take part in the svayam3vara
<>killed each other in mutual fight. Depressed and embit-
<>tered by all this, Divya1 decided torenounce all worldly
<>pleasures and proceeded to the forest.
<NI>Once S4uka named Ujjvala came to Plaks2advi1pa.
<>Moved to pity at the grief-stricken Divya1 he taught her
<>“As4u1nyas4ayana” vrata. When she practised this vrata
<>with devotion for about four years, Maha1vis2n2u appeared
<>before her and took her with him to Vis2n2uloka.
<HI>DIVYAKAT2AM. A city situated in Western India in
<>ancient times. According to Maha1bha1rata this city was
<>conquered by Nakula.--Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 32.
<HI>DIVYAKARMAKR2T. A Vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 91, Verse 35).
<HI>DIVYASA1NU. A Vis4vadeva. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 91, Verse 30).
<HI>DIVYAVARS2A(M). 365 days make one year for hu-
<>man beings. One year for human beings is one day for
<>the gods. 365 such days of the gods make one year for
<>the gods. This means that 365 years for human beings
<>are equal to one year for the gods. The year for the
<>gods is known as “Divyavarsa” or “Divyavatsara”.
<>Kr2tayuga is made up of 4,800 Divyavatsaras. Treta1yu-
<>uga has 3,600 Divyavatsaras. 2,400 Divyavatsaras make
<>up one Dva1parayuga. Kaliyuga has 1,200 Divyavatsaras.
<>12,000 Divyavars2as of this kind make up one “catur-
<>yuga”. 71 Caturyugas are the period of one Manu.
<>After the end of the period of one Manu, the gods
<>complete their term of existence. The total period of
<>14 Manus is called a Kalpa. At the end of every
<>Kalpa there is a deluge. One Kalpa is one day time
<>for Brahma1. After the deluge, until the time of one
<>Kalpa, is Brahma1's night. There is no universe at that
<>time. At the end of that Kalpa, the next Kalpa
<>begins and Brahma1 starts his work of creation.
<>In this way when 360 days and nights of Brahma1
<>are completed, it is one Brahma1 Vars2a. One Brahma1
<>life-span is 120 such years. After that there is nothing [Page246-b+ 64]
<>for a Brahma1's life-span. Then Brahma1 is re-born and
<>resumes creation. (Bha1gavata, Das4ama Skandha).
<HI>DRAUPADI1. Pa1n5ca1li1, the wife of the Pa1n2d2avas. (See
<>under Pa1n5ca1li1).
<HI>DRAUPADI1HARAN2A PARVA. A sub section of Vana
<>Parva in the Maha1bha1rata. This covers Chapters 262
<>to 271 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAUPADI1SATYABHA1MA1SAM3VA1DA PARVA. A
<>sub section of Vana Parva, in the Maha1bha1rata. This
<>comprises Chapters 233 to 235 of Vana Parva.
<HI>DRAVID2A I. A King of the family of Priyavrata who
<>was the son of Manu. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 5).
<HI>DRAVID2A II. A gandharva who was the father of
<>Kam3sa. (See under Kam3sa) Am3s4umati1 was the daugh-
<>ter of this gandharva. (See under Am3s4umati1).
<HI>DRAVID2A(M). (DRA1VID2A). In ancient days the
<>whole of South India was known by the name Tami-
<>laka, as Tamil was the language used throughout South
<>India. Strictly speaking, all the languages used in
<>South India were given the name Tamil. The word
<>‘Tamil’ underwent changes in the language of North
<>India and took the form ‘Dra1vida’. Etymologists are
<>of opinion that the changes that took place in the word
<>Tamil were are follows:- Tamil--Damil--Damid2-
<>-Dramid2--Dravid2--Dra1vid2. Reference to the
<>Dra1vid2a country occurs in most of the Pura1n2as.
<>Maha1bha1rata states that Sahadeva, one of the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas, sent a note for collecting taxes from the people of
<>Dra1vida. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 71.
<NI>“There are other countries also in the southern Bha1rata
<>such as Dravida, Kerala, Pra1cya, Mu1s2i1ka, Vanava1si1ka
<>Karn2a1t2aka, Mahis2aka, Vikalpa and Mu1s2aka.” This
<>statement (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 9) throws
<>light on the various countries which existed in South
<>India at the time of Maha1bha1rata. In Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 10, it is mentioned that Kam3sa, the uncle of
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, was the son of Dramila, a gandharva. (See
<>under Kam3sa).
<HI>DRA1VIDAS. It is stated in Maha1bha1rata (Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 33, Stanza 22) that the dra1vidas were
<>originally Ks2atriyas and that they became S4u1dras by
<>the curse of Bra1hman2as.
<HI>DRA1VID2A BHA1S2A1. (Dravidian Language). Linguists
<>have classified the languages of the world under certain
<>groups. Important among them are the Indo-European
<>group, the semitic group, the Hamitic group, the Ural
<>Altaic group, the South East Asiatic group, the Dravi-
<>dian group, Austric group, the Bantu group and the
<>Chinese group.
<NI>Almost all the languages in South India belong to the
<>Dravidian group. The languages of this group are
<>Tamil, Telugu, Kannad2a, Malaya1lam, Tulu, Kut2aku,
<>Tot2a, Kot2a, Bad2aka, Kuruk and Bra1hu1i1. Of these
<>Bra1hu1i1 alone is used in the mountain regions of Balu-
<>cisthan. Linguists like Smi1mud and others have stated
<>that there is a close relation between the Australian and
<>Dravidian languages. The A1ryan language has influence-
<>ed the Dravidian languages to a great extent. But Tamil
<>has not been so much influenced as Telugu, Kannad2a
<>and Malaya1lam. It is because Tamil had a great wealth
<>of literature of its own from ancient times.
<>The Dravidian group is again divided into four sections:
<>Eastern, Western, Northern and Southern. Bra1hu1i1
<>is the only language in the Northern section. Its Ety- [Page247-a+ 64]
<>mology, grammar etc. are like that of the Dravidian
<>group. But it had been influenced to a large extent by
<>the Iranian language. Still it keeps its Dravidian cha-
<>racter.
<NI>Telugu, Gon2d2i, Kuruk, Kola1mi, Ma1lt2a etc. come under
<>the Eastern group. Of these only Telugu has grown as
<>a literary language. Telugu is in use from Madras to
<>Mahendragiri. But it has various sub-divisions and local
<>differences. The Telugu used in the Districts of Kr2s2n2a1
<>and Goda1vari1 is considered to be the purest form.
<>Golari, Sa1leva1ri, Ka1ma1ri, Va1sari, Da1sari etc. are its local
<>sub-divisions. Over modern Telugu, Sanskrit has its
<>full sway.
<NI>Kannad2a, Kut2aku, Tot2a, Kod2a, etc. come under the
<>western group. Kannad2a is used in Mysore and the
<>vicinity of the Districts of Coimbatore, Salem, Bellary,
<>Anantapore etc. Bad2aka used in the Nilgiris, Kurumpa,
<>used in the vicinity of Nilgiris, Kut2aku used in
<>Coorg, are the sub divisions of Kannad2a. In edicts from
<>the 5th century Kannad2a could be seen in its ancient
<>form. The modern Kannad2a has been used from 16th
<>century onwards. Tulu is in use in places between the
<>rivers Candragiri in the south of. Southern Canara and
<>Kalya1n2apuri1. Only a few ancient songs could be includ-
<>ed in Tulu literature. The Malaya1lam script is used
<>to write Tulu. But now certain books in Tulu have
<>been published using Kannad2a script.
<NI>Tamil and Malaya1lam are the languages of the Sou-
<>thern section. The oldest literature in the Dravidian
<>group is in Tamil. The most ancient form of Tamil
<>is seen in the edicts and stone tables of the 30th century
<>B.C. The most important among them are the San3ga
<>works. The grammatical work ‘Tolka1ppiyam, is the
<>literary grammar of Centamil. Malaya1lam became an
<>independent language only by the 8th century A.D. The
<>close relation that exists between Tamil and Malaya1lam
<>is not visible in any other language of the Dravidian
<>group. By examining the inter-relations of the various
<>languages in the Dravidian group, and noting
<>how close or distant the relation is, we can ascertain
<>which languages separated themselves first from the
<>original Dravida language.
<HI>DRAVIN2ASA. A Pracetas. (One of the ten sons of the
<>Pra1ci1na Barhis). (Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<HI>DRAVIRATHA. A King of the family of An3ga. He was
<>the son of Dadhiva1hana and the father of Dharmaratha
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 277).
<HI>DRAVYAS4UDDHI. Purifying impure things, The
<>mode of purification of impure things, in ancient
<>India, was known as dravyas4uddhi. The procedure of
<>purification was as follows:
<NI>If earthern-wares became impure by coming into con-
<>tact with urine or excreta, they should be burnt in fire.
<>Golden or copper vessels may be remoulded or filled
<>with or dipped in tamarind water. Things made of
<>iron or bronze may be washed in ash-water. Things
<>made of glass or pearl need only be washed in pure
<>water. Things born in water such as lotus etc. could
<>be purified by dipping them in water. If cloth is made
<>impure rub it with soil and dip it in water. If it is a
<>large quantity of cloth, a mixture of soil and water may
<>be sprinkled on it. Wooden things will become pure
<>by planing. Cot, chair, fan, cart etc. need only be
<>washed. Pots used for cooking meat may be touched [Page247-b+ 64]
<>with cow's milk. Things made of ivory may be washed
<>in mustard-water. Jaggery, salt etc. need only be dried.
<>(Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 156).
<HI>DR2D2HA I. (DR2D2HAVARMAN). One of the hundred

<HI>DRON2A I. The teacher in archery of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>the Kauravas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Dron2a was the son of Bharadva1ja who had his
<>hermitage erected on the bank of the Ganges. Once
<>Bharadva1ja went to bathe in the river. When he got
<>into the river he saw the celestial maid Ghr2ta1ci1. The cele-
<>stial maid ran away as soon as she saw the hermit. But
<>her cloth was caught in grass and slipped off her body.
<>When the hermit saw the complete form of her body
<>which was bright and beautiful, he had seminal discharge.
<>The discharged semen was kept in a Dron2a (trough).
<>A child was born from that and he was named
<>Dron2a, who was brought up in the hermitage. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 13).
<NI>2) {%Education and Marriage.%} Dron2a learned the art of
<>using weapons from his father and the hermit Agnives4a.
<>Drupada the prince of Pa1n5ca1la was the fellow student
<>of Dron2a. They became great friends. On completion
<>of education Drupada returned to Pa1n5ca1la. Dron2a
<>married Kr2pi1 the daughter of S4aradva1n. A son was born
<>to them. At his birth the child neighed like the horse
<>Uccaih2s4ravas; so his parents named him As4vattha1ma1.
<>Hearing that Paras ura1ma was giving Bra1hman2as free
<>gift of wealth and property, Dron2a reached there.
<>Dron2a's desire was to get Dhanurveda (the art of
<>archery). Dron2a with his disciples went to Mahendra-
<>giri and saw Paras4ura1ma, who was about to enter forest
<>giving away everything he had. Paras4ura1ma said, “I
<>have given away to the Bra1hman2as gold and everything
<>I had. The land I had conquered is given to Kas4yapa.
<>Now there remains only my body and some weapons.
<>You can have one of them.”
<NI>Dron2a preferred the weapons. Thus Dron2a got the
<>entire armoury of Paras4ura1ma. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 13).
<NI>3) {%He became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas.%}
<>After receiving dhanurveda from Paras4ura1ma Dron2a
<>went to Pa1n5ca1la. Drupada who had been a fellow
<>student of Dron2a was the King of Uttarapan5ca1la. then.
<>Though Dron2a had become proficient in archery, he
<>was very poor.
<NI>He had no money even to buy milk for his child. Once
<>the playmates of As4vattha1ma1 made him drink a mix-
<>ture of water and flour saying that it was milk. So
<>Dron2a approached Drupada for financial help. But
<>Drupada shunned his fellow student, scolded him and
<>sent him away without giving any help. Dron2a vowed
<>that he would, somehow or other, take revenge upon
<>Drupada and departed from Pa1n5ca1la.
<NI>The aim of Dron2a was to get some capable disciples. He
<>reached Hastina1pura and stayed in disguise with Gautama
<>for a while. Once the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas who
<>were boys were engaged in the game of Ka1ra (a kind
<>of cricket play) outside the palace premises. The ball
<>fell in a well by chance. The princess stood round the
<>well and began to ponder how to get the ‘ball’ out of
<>the well. They tried all means but in vain. At that
<>time a Bra1hman2a of dark complexion, short and aged,
<>came by that way. It was Dron2a. The boys gathered
<>round the old man. Dron2a threw his ring also into the
<F>1. To take revenge on Drupada was the thought that was uppermost in the mind of Dron2a.</F> [Page248-b+ 64]
<>well and said: “Your kingly qualities are very poor.
<>Your education in using weapons is not complete. If
<>you give me a meal I will get both the ring and the
<>ball together” The boys agreed to the conditions.
<>Dron2a took a grass and evoked arrow into it by mantra
<>(spell) and shot it at the ‘Ka1ra’. The next grass was
<>shot at the first grass. It struck the first grass. Thus he
<>shot grasses one after another till the grass reached the
<>brink of the well and by pulling the grass he took the ball
<>out. In the same way he took the ring also out of the
<>well. When they got the ‘Ka1ra’ the boys stood round
<>Dron2a and asked him what he would like as the reward
<>for his deed. Dron2a said that they need only tell Bhi1s2ma
<>how a short man of dark complexion took the ball out of
<>the well. Accordingly the boys went to Bhi1s2ma and
<>told him everything. Immediately Bhi1s2ma understood
<>that it was Dron2a. Bhi1s2ma thought that Dron2a was the
<>best person to teach the princes. So Dron2a was brought to
<>the palace and was engaged as the teacher in archery.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 130 and 131).
<NI>4) {%Education in Archery of the Kauravas and reward.%}
<NI>(a) {%First vow.%} Dron2a asked the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kau-
<>ravas to sit together and then told them. “There is one
<>thing that you should do for me when your education
<>is over”. Hearing this they all kept silent. But Arjuna
<>came forward and took the vow that he would achieve
<>that task according to the wish of the teacher.
<NI>{%(b) The disciple who is second to none.%} The training in
<>weapons commenced. Hearing of the fame of Dron2a,
<>disciples came from places far and near. Arjuna was
<>the first of all the students. Sending all the students to
<>fetch water Dron2a taught his son As4vattha1ma1 certain
<>special lessons. Arjuna secretly knew this. So he
<>brought water as quickly as possible before the others.
<>As Dron2a loved his brilliant student Arjuna, he taught
<>both his son and Arjuna alike the secrets. Seeing the
<>brilliance of Arjuna Dron2a ordered the cook not to seat
<>Arjuna in a dark place for meals. Yet it happened once
<>that the light was extinguished by wind while the prin-
<>ces were having their meals. All sat still, without eating,
<>while Arjuna alone ate his food. From this Arjuna
<>discovered that without seeing the object one could hit
<>the target by constant practice. Dron2a was greatly
<>pleased at this and embracing him promised to try to
<>make him such an expert that there would be none
<>equal to him in archery.
<NI>{%(c) Ekalavya.%} Once Arjuna and the other disciples went
<>to the forest for a hunt and there they met Ekalavya
<>who was superior to Arjuna in archery. This Ekalavya
<>had once approached Dron2a to learn archery from him.
<>But it was against the rule for a Brahmin to teach a
<>forester the art of fighting. So Ekalavya returned to the
<>forest and making an earthen image of Dron2a worshipp-
<>ed it and began self-learning in archery. Now he had
<>become superior to Arjuna in archery. The teacher
<>had said that none would be equal to Arjuna in archery.
<>Arjuna told Dron2a about Ekalavya. The teacher went
<>to the forest and got the thumb of Ekalavya as the
<>reward due to the teacher. Since then Ekalavya became
<>a great archer though only of a lower level than Arjuna
<>(See under Ekalavya).
<NI>{%d) Expert disciple.%} The education in archery and the
<>use of weapons was nearing completion. In archery
<>Arjuna was second to none. Duryodhana and Bhi1ma [Page249-a+ 65]
<>became expert club-men. As4vattha1ma1 was the first in
<>the secrets of archery. Nakula and Sahadeva became
<>expert swordsmen. Arjuna was expert in all branches of
<>weapon-training. Bhi1ma had bodily strength and Arjuna
<>had the strength of learning. Yudhis2t2hira was the fore-
<>most in chariot-fighting.
<NI>e) {%Artificial bird.%} Once Dron2a placed an artificial bird
<>on the branch of a tree without the knowledge of the
<>princes, to test their practice in archery. Then he
<>placed his disciples with their bows, around the tree,
<>and told them to shoot the bird down at his command.
<>Dron2a first called Dharmaputra and told him to look
<>at the bird. Then he asked him what he saw. Dharma-
<>putra said that he saw the bird, the tree, the teacher
<>and the students. He tested one by one. All gave the
<>same reply, that Dharmaputra gave. At last he asked
<>Arjuna. Arjuna stood for a while, taking aim and said
<>that he saw a bird only. The teacher commanded to
<>shoot and Arjuna sent an arrow. At the first shot the bird
<>fell down headless. With this test Dron2a understood that
<>Arjuna could defeat Drupada and embraced his
<>disciple.
<NI>{%(f) Dron2a caught by a crocodile.%} Once Dron2a and his
<>disciples went to bathe in the Ganges. While they were
<>dipping and splashing in the water a crocodile caught
<>Dron2a by the leg. Dron2a was unable to extricate
<>himself from the grip of the crocodile. So he asked his
<>disciples to shoot the crocodile and kill it. All stood
<>agape. Arjuna at once took bow and arrows and sent
<>five arrows one after another at the crocodile, which
<>died instantly and came afloat. The teacher, who
<>was much pleased, got out of the water and embraced
<>Arjuna and taught him ‘Brahma S4ira1stra’, a divine
<>weapon. After imparting this knowledge Dron2a told
<>Arjuna not to operate this weapon on man. But if an
<>enemy superior to man attacked him, then only, he
<>should send this missile at him to kill him.
<NI>Giving due respect to the advice of the teacher, Arjuna
<>received the Brahmas4ira1stra. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 133).
<NI>g) {%Demonstration by the pupils.%} When the training of the prin-
<>ces terminated, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accorded sanction to hold a
<>demonstration of weapon-play, by the princes. An
<>arena was got ready. Dron2a entered the arena. As a
<>preliminary rite Dron2a worshipped the gods. Then he
<>invited Bra1hman2as to bless his pupils. After that the
<>pupils gave the teacher, gold, precious stones, cloths,
<>and other costly things. The princes paid homage to
<>to their teacher. The teacher gave his blessings to
<>them. With this the demonstration commenced.
<>Clubbing between Duryodhana and Bhi1ma was a
<>terrible one. But the mock fighting changed to a seri-
<>ous fight. Dron2a sent As4vattha1ma1 who separated them.
<>The audience applauded their performance. The per-
<>formance of Arjuna was of the most superior type and
<>the audience and the teacher were struck with wonder
<>at his extraordinary capability. Karn2a also showed
<>his performance. (For details see under Arjuna, Para 1
<>and Karn2a, Para 4). (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapters 133
<>and 134).
<NI>5) {%Revenge upon Drupada.%} When demonstration came to
<>an end it was the time for giving the teacher the gift
<>due to him. The teacher had, at the beginning, told
<>his pupils that on completion of the training they should
<>give him a gift. Accordingly he demanded that Drupada, [Page249-b+ 65]
<>the King of Pa1n5ca1la, should be brought before him with
<>his hands tied. As soon as Duryodhana and Karn2a heard
<>this they rapidly marched to Pa1n5ca1la and engaged
<>Drupada in a fight but were defeated by Drupada. After
<>that Arjuna entered the battle-field, defeated and tied
<>Drupada and brought him before Dron2a who was kind
<>enough not to kill Drupada. The Kingdom of Pa1n5ca1la
<>was divided into two. Drupada was given Uttara-Pa1n5-
<>ca1la and Dron2a took Daks2in2a Pa1n5ca1la. Then Drupada
<>was released. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 137).
<NI>6) {%Arjuna is accorded sanction to fight with his teacher.%} One
<>year after the revenge on Drupada Yudhis2t2hira was
<>anointed as heir-apparent, by Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Once, in
<>the council of the king, Dron2a called Arjuna to him and
<>said: “Oh, Arjuna! you must take an oath to do a parti-
<>cular thing in the presence of your relatives. If it happens
<>that I oppose you in battle you should fight against me
<>without thinking that I am your teacher. This oath is
<>your gift to your teacher.” Arjuna agreed and took the
<>oath in the presence of the people. Because there was such
<>an oath Arjuna's conscience did not prick him when he
<>had to fight against his teacher Dron2a in the battle of
<>Bha1rata between the Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas. (M.B.
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 139).
<NI>7) {%Part played by Dron2a up to the battle of Bha1rata.%}
<>(1) Duryodhana and his party came to know only at
<>the time of the svayam3vara (marriage) of Pa1n5ca1li1 that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas were not killed in the lac house burning.
<>When Arjuna won the test and got Pa1n5ca1li1, the Kaura-
<>vas became furious and began to plot against the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. At that time Dron2a came to the council-hall
<>of the Kauravas and said that the Kauravas should go
<>to Pa1n5ca1la and greet the Pa1n2d2avas, bring them back
<>and give them half of the kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 203).
<NI>(2) Dron2a was present at the sacrifice of Ra1jasu1ya
<>(imperial consecration) performed by Yudhis2t2hira.
<>(M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 34, Stanza 8).
<NI>(3) When the game of dice was going on between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira Dron2a came with Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>to the place to witness the game. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 60, Stanza 2).
<NI>(4) Dron2a declared that the game of dice between
<>S4akuni and Yudhis2t2hira was not fair (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Stanza 2).
<NI>(5) Dron2a was well-versed in archery. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 4).
<NI>(6) While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the country of
<>Vira1t2a, Arjuna in the guise of Br2hannala, fought with the
<>Kauravas. Dron2a was the first to recognize Br2hannala
<>as Arjuna at the sound of his conch. (M.B. Vira1t2a
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Stanza 24).
<NI>(7) In that fight Dron2a fought with Arjuna whose
<>arrows wounded Dron2a and he ran away from the
<>battlefield. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 58).
<NI>(8) When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a came to the council-hall of the
<>Kauravas to plead for a treaty on behalf of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>who had returned after forest life and pseudonymity,
<>Dron2a took the side of the Pa1n2d2avas and argued with
<>Duryodhana. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 126).
<NI>(9) Dron2a advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to see that a battle
<>between the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas was avoided.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, two Chapters from 138).
<NI>(10) When it was almost decided that the battle was
<>inevitable Dron2a boasted to Duryodhana that he would [Page250-a+ 62]
<>annihilate the army of the Pa1n2d2avas within a month.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 193, Stanza 18).
<NI>8) {%Why Dron2a whose leaning was towards the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>t2ook the side of the Kauravas in the battle of Bha1rata.%} At
<>heart Dron2a was on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas. But he
<>fought against them, taking the side of the Kauravas.
<>Even at that time he ardently wished the Pa1n2d2avas to
<>win the battle. What is the reason for it? An answer to
<>this question is found in Maha1bha1rata, Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 43.
<NI>The battle was about to begin. Dharmaputra went to
<>Dron2a and bowed before him and requested to bless
<>him so that he might win the battle against the Kaura-
<>vas. Dron2a said, “It is good on your part to have
<>come and seen me before the battle is begun. If you
<>had not seen me I would have cursed you to lose the
<>battle. But today I am honoured since you have come.
<>You fight the battle. Victory is yours. But I have to
<>stand with the Kauravas, and there is a reason for it.
<>Man is a slave of money and money is not the slave
<>of Man. The Kauravas have tied me with money. S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a will be on the side of the righteous. Where S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a is, there will be victory. But so long as I fight
<>it is difficult for you to win. So try to kill me at the
<>beginning of the battle. You need not feel sorry for
<>killing your teacher. Because when I shower arrows
<>and fight vehemently I won't look to see which enemy
<>has struck me down. Enemies could kill me only when
<>I am lying on darbha grass leaving fighting in dis-
<>appointment. I will put down my weapons in battle
<>only when I hear words which I dislike to hear.”
<NI>After having revealed these secrets of his own he sent
<>Yudhis2t2hira back. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 43).
<NI>9) {%Dron2a in the battle of Bha1rata.%} (1) On the first day
<>of the battle Dron2a fought in a combat with Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna, who was defeated. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva,

<>(Drupada).
<NI>2) {%Education and kingship.%} Yajn5asena went to the hermi-
<>tage of Bharadva1ja for education. Dron2a, who became
<>a great teacher in archery later, was also a student and
<>disciple of Bharadva1ja at that time. Thus during the
<>time of education both Drupada and Dron2a became
<>fast friends. After receiving education Drupada re-
<>turned to his country. At that time Pa1n5ca1la was ruled
<>by Pr2s2ata. When Yajn5asena returned on completion of
<>his education, Pr2s2ata died and Yajn5asena was anointed
<>as King of Uttara-Pa1n5ca1la. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 129).
<NI>3) {%Yajn5asena reproaches Dron2a.%} It has already been said
<>that during the period of education Dron2a and Yajn5a-
<>sena were fast friends. Once Drupada said to Dron2a:
<>“My dear friend. My father has told me that I would
<>be made the King of Uttara Pa1n5ca1la on completing my
<>education. Thus if I become a King, the treasury of the
<>King will be at your disposal.”
<NI>After the education both returned to their places. Not
<>much later Dron2a got married. A son born to him was
<>named As4vattha1ma1. Dron2a was so poor that he could
<>not even buy milk for his child. Once the friends of
<>As4vattha1ma1 mixed flour in water and made him drink
<>it saying that it was milk. As4vattha1ma1 drank it without
<>knowing that it was not milk. Thinking that he had
<>become energetic by drinking milk he began to run
<>with the other boys. At last they told him the truth
<>and teased him.
<NI>With his wife and child Dron2a went to Drupada who
<>did not care to recognize him as a friend. Dron2a tried
<>to remind him of their former friendship. But Drupada
<>shunned him and said, “If I had friendship with you,
<>it was to achieve certain ends. There is no friendship
<>between the rich and the poor, the learned and the
<>illiterate, the brave and the coward. So if there was
<>any friendship at all it was not real. You, who are slow
<>of brain! Kings of high status cannot have friendship
<>with such people especially the poor. A Brahmin
<>learned in Vedas won't befriend a Brahmin who is not
<>learned in Vedas, a man seated in a chariot cannot
<>befriend a man who is not seated in a chariot and a
<>King cannot befriend one who is not a King. So a
<>friendship of bygone days is no friendship at all”.
<NI>Drupada's reproaches aroused a storm of anger in
<>Dron2a. He vowed that he would avenge the insult.
<>With his wife and child he got out of the palace. He [Page252-a+ 65]
<>wandered about in search of disciples who were capable
<>of confronting with Drupada. At last he came to
<>Hastina1pura and became the teacher of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 130).
<NI>4) {%The revenge of Dron2a.%} Dron2a told Bhi1s2ma about his
<>dealings with Drupada. Bhi1s2ma consoled Dron2a. Before
<>the commencement of the training in archery, Dron2a
<>told his disciples: “When your training in archery is
<>completed you will have to do a favour to your tea-
<>cher”. All stood agape. But Arjuna came forward and
<>said: “I will do”. Dron2a embraced Arjuna. The train-
<>ing commenced. The Andhakas, Vr2s2n2is and others
<>joined his school of archery.
<NI>The training in archery came to an end. Dron2a called
<>his disciples and told them that Drupada should be
<>tied with a rope and placed before him. When they
<>heard the words of the teacher, Duryodhana, Karn2a, Yu-
<>yutsu, Dus4s4a1sana, Vikarn2a, Jara1sandha and Sulocana led
<>the Kauravas to Pa1n5ca1la. Arjuna knew that the
<>Kauravas would not be able to defeat Drupada. He
<>told the teacher that when the Kauravas returned
<>without achieving the task, he himself would go and
<>bring Drupada. After a terrible battle the Kauravas
<>were defeated by the Pa1n5ca1las. After that Arjuna con-
<>fronted Drupada. Nakula and Sahadeva stood as
<>guards of the wheels. Bhi1masena with his club stood
<>in front of the army. Arjuna drove the chariot right
<>in the midst of the Pa1n5ca1la army. Bhi1ma took his club
<>and a terrible battle ensued. Arjuna shattered the
<>Pa1n5ca1la army, bound Drupada and took him to Dron2a.
<>The teacher looked at Drupada and reproached him
<>with scornful word: “I have destroyed your country.
<>Now you are at my mercy. Is not the former friendship
<>a friendship?” Drupada requested that they should be
<>friends in future. Accordingly Drupada was set free.
<>The country of Pa1n5ca1la was divided into two, and
<>giving Uttara Pa1n5ca1la to Drupada, Dron2a took Daks2in2a
<>Pa1n5ca1la. Thus because of the revenge of Dron2a, Dru-
<>pada lost half of his kingdom. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 137).
<NI>5) {%Birth of Children.%} Though Dron2a and Drupada
<>were on friendly terms Drupada did not forget the
<>defeat he had incurred at the hands of Dron2a. So,
<>Drupada desired to have a son who would become
<>powerful enough to take revenge on Dron2a. He began
<>to think of ways and means. He consulted several
<>learned Brahmins. At that time two hermit brothers
<>ya1ja and Upaya1ja lived on the bank of the Ganges.
<>The King approached them and requested their help to
<>obtain a son, who would kill Dron2a, and promised to
<>give them cows and other precious things in return.
<>At first they refused to help him. The King served
<>Upaya1ja for a year, and pleased him. He sent the King
<>to the hermitage of Ya1ja. They accepted the request
<>of the King. Both the hermits performed a sacrifice
<>for Drupada. A boy and a girl arose from the sacrifi-
<>cial fire. The boy was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna and the
<>girl was named Kr2s2n2a1 (Pa1n5ca1li1). There was a celes-
<>tial voice that the boy would kill Dron2a when he grew
<>up. (M.B. A1di parva, Chapter 167).
<NI>6) {%The marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 grew up. Drupada
<>desired to give her in marriage to Arjuna. But at that
<>time the lac-house caught fire and the Pa1n2d2avas disap-
<>peared. Drupada set certain tests in the Svayam3vara
<>of Pa1n5ca1li1 with a view to ascertain if Arjuna was alive. [Page252-b+ 65]
<>The Pa1n2d2avas came to the svayam3vara and Drupada
<>found out Arjuna. But Drupada did not like the idea
<>of his daughter becoming the wife of more than one
<>husband. Then Vya1sa appeared there and informed
<>Drupada of the previous births of the Pa1n2d2avas and
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. Drupada was much pleased and he gave the
<>Pa1n2d2avas a good deal of wealth and sent Pa1n5ca1li1 with
<>them. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 196).
<NI>7) {%Other details%} (1) Drupada was present at the marri-

<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Da1navas were the offsprings of Kas4yapa,
<>grandson of Brahma1 and son of Mari1ci by his wife
<>Danu, daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. Maya, chief among
<>the Da1navas earned great reputation as a unique archi
<>tect. Once Maya attended a dance programme in
<>devaloka where he fell in love with Hema1 dancing with
<>the deva-women. When the dance was over Maya told
<>Hema1 about his love for her. Hema1 too had fallen in
<>love with Maya. And they left the place in secret and
<>reached the southern slope of the Hima1layas where they
<>built a beautiful city called Hemapura and they lived
<>there. Ere long they-had two sons, Dundubhi and
<>Ma1ya1vi1, both of them equally distinguished in prowess.
<>Uttarara1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Dundubhi's relati nship with Ra1van2a.%} Maya did tapas
<>for a daughter in the western plains of Mount Kaila1sa.
<>One of those days Pa1rvati1 went out of Kaila1sa to feed
<>brahmins in celebration of the birthday of Subrah-
<>man2ya. In the absence of Pa1rvati1 a deva woman called
<>Madhura1 who had observed the Somava1ravrata came
<>to Kaila1sa to salute Maha1deva (S4iva) who enjoyed her
<>for some time. On her return to S4iva Pa1rvati1 noticed
<>ashes worn by him transferred to the breasts of
<>Madhura1. Drawing the natural inference from this
<>Pa1rvati1 got angry and cursed Madhura1 to be transform- [Page253-b+ 65]
<>ed into a frog. Then S4iva blessed her that she would
<>regain her former self after twelve years and have a
<>heroic husband. Madhura1 who was thus turned into a
<>frog fell into a well close to where Maya was engaged
<>in tapas. And, after twelve years, the frog regained its
<>former form and became Madhura1 again. Maya, who
<>saw her adopted her as daughter and brought her up as
<>such calling her Mandodari1. Mandodari1 became Ra1v-
<>an2a’ wife and thus Dundubhi became the brother-in-law
<>of Ra1van2a.
<NI>3) {%Dundubhi grew up.%} The following is told about Dun-
<>dubhi in Canto 11, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a of Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a.
<NI>As beautiful and majestic as the peak of Mount Kaila1sa,
<>the heroic Dundubhi possessed the form of the buffalo.
<>And, he had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<>Proud and haughty over his own prowess and losing his
<>head over the boon he had received from God, Dundu-
<>bhi went to fight with the ocean, the lord of rivers. (It
<>was S4iva who gave him boons. See M.B. Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 11).
<NI>4) {%Fight with Ba1li and death.%} Haughty almost to mad-
<>ness over the unrivalled strength and prowess he got as
<>the result of the boon, Dundubhi went about challeng-
<>ing whomsoever he met for a fight. But none dared to
<>accept the challenge. Then he went to the sea-shore
<>and challenged Varun2a, who, appearing on the crest
<>of the waves said: “I am not strong and powerful
<>enough to fight with you. Only Himava1n can do that.
<>So, please go north.”
<NI>Accordingly Dundubhi went north to Himava1n and
<>challenged him in great rage. Himava1n clad in his neat
<>and white apparel appeared and spoke in humble tones:
<>“Oh mighty Da1nava: I am not accustomed to fighting
<>war. My job is only to arrange necessary conveni-
<>ence to saints and sages. But, there is in southern India
<>a very powerful monkey called Ba1li, who is the King of
<>Kis2kindha1, and Ba1li alone can combat with you.
<NI>And, Dundubhi accordingly went southward to Kis2kin-
<>dha1 and challenged Ba1li. Terrible as the dark clouds in
<>the sky the da1nava who possessed the body and
<>horns of the buffalo--began roaring like hell at the tower
<>gates of Kis2kindha1, uprooting trees with his horn and
<>tearing the earth with his hoofs. Disturbed by the noise
<>Ba1li along with his wife Ta1ra1 came out of the palace,
<>and said to Dundubhi: “Look here, please, I am only
<>a King of the monkeys. Why should you, who are so
<>very strong smash my tower?” but, these soft words of
<>Ba1li only kindled Dundubhi's anger all the more and his
<>challenges became the fiercer. Then did Ba1li, wearing
<>the golden chain given by Indra, rush forth to engage
<>Dundubhi in mortal duel in which the former began
<>gaining more and more strength while the latter got wea-
<>ker and weaker. Dundubhi took to flight in the skies to
<>save his life. But, the moon dawned then and in the
<>moonlight Ba1li and his brother Sugri1va followed Dun-
<>dubhi, who entered a terrible cave covered by something
<>like a forest of grass. After stationing Sugri1va at the
<>opening of the cave Ba1li followed Dundubhi into the
<>cave. Sugri1va waited there one year for the return of
<>Ba1li from the cave when one day he witnessed foaming
<>blood flow out of the mouth of the cave, and mistakenly
<>believing that Ba1li was dead he closed the mouth of the
<>cave with a huge stone and returned home. But, Ba1li,
<>who had by then killed Dundubhi kicked off the stone [Page254-a+ 65]
<>and came out of the cave and followed Sugri1va in a
<>rage. From that day onwards S4ugri1va lived at the R2s2ya-
<>mu1ka mountain where Ba1li had no admission. (Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 9, 11, 46).
<NI>5) {%Curse on Ba1li due to the blood of Dundubhi.%} During
<>Ba1li's duel with Dundubhi blood from the body of the
<>latter spurted out to the skies, and it also fell in the
<>hermitage of Matan3ga at R2s2yamu1ka where the sage
<>Matan3ga was performing tapas. Angered at this the sage
<>cursed him whoever he might be, who was responsible
<>for blood falling in his a1s4rama, with death by his head
<>getting broken if he mounted R2s2yamu1ka. Sugri1va took
<>shelter there because of this curse on Ba1li. (Va1lmi1ki

<HI>DUNDUBHINIHRA1DA. A powerful Ra1ks2asa, who was
<>the son of Diti and the uncle of Prahla1da. When, in
<>the fierce fight between the devas and the asuras the
<>latter got absolutely defeated this Ra1ks2asa ascribed
<>the reson for the failure to the brahmins and began
<>killing them. He captured the Ka1s4i1 temple and many
<>other temples like it. In the circumstances S4iva gave
<>refuge to the brahmins of Ka1s4i1, and the Ra1ks2asa was
<>destroyed by S4ivas4akti. (S4ivarudrasam3hita1, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a, Chapter 58).
<HI>DUNDUBHISVANA(M). A particular Place in Kus4a
<>island. (M.B. Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 13).
<HI>DURA1DHA (DURA1DHA1RA, DURDHARA). One of
<>the hundred sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed by
<>Bhi1ma. (M.B. Dron2a Parva, Chapter 135, Verse 36).
<HI>DURA1DHA1RA. See under Dura1dha.
<HI>DURA1SADA. A son of Bhasma1sura. He learned Pan5ca1k-
<>s2ari1 vidya1 from S4iva and used to repeat it. Pleased at
<>this S4iva gave him all the boons he wanted with the
<>result that he lost his head and began troubling every-
<>body. When thus unrest and injustices increased in the
<>world D2hum3d2hi, the son of S4akti killed him. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 38, 42).
<HI>DURDAMA. Son of a Gandharva called Vis4va1vasu.
<>The following story about him is told in the Skanda
<>Pura1n2a. Chapters 1, 3 and 4).
<NI>While mahars2is like Vasis2t2ha and Atri were once
<>engaged in the worship of Lord S4iva at Mount Kaila1sa,
<>Durdama, with his thousands of wives came there. In
<>the Ha1la1syati1rtha near-by they got engaged in water
<>sports with their bodies stark naked. On seeing their
<>naked sports Vasis2t2ha cursed Durdama to be turned
<>into a Ra1ks2asa. When his wives begged of Vasis2t2ha for
<>redemption from the curse he told them that seven-
<>teen years thence Durdama would regain his old form.
<>Durdama thus turned Ra1ks2asa tried once to devour
<>sage Ga1lava when the Sudars4ana Cakra of Vis2n2u killed
<>him. He regained his old form and returned to
<>Gandharvaloka.
<HI>DURDHARS2AN2A. (Durmada). One of the hundred
<>sons of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. He was killed by Bhi1ma. (Dron2a

<HI>DURGA1 I. The goddess of the universe, Durga1
<>possesses different forms and aspects. Pa1rvati1, spouse of
<>S4iva is a form of Durga1. According to the prayer of
<>devotees this Devi1 assumes diverse forms. She is
<>worshipped in 64 forms as A1ryadurga1, Vedagarbha1,
<>Ambika1, Bhadraka1li1, Bhadra1, Ks2ema1ks2emakari1, Naika-
<>ba1hu, Devi1 etc. In south India she is worshipped more
<>in her fierce and terrible forms. Devi1 in her gentle [Page254-b+ 65]
<>aspects and moods assumes the forms of Kanya1,
<>Ka1ma1ks2i1 and Mu1ka1mba1. In Kerala the Devi1 is called
<>Bhagavati1 also, in Andhra Jokula1mbika1 and in Tamil-
<>nadu Kan2n2aki1. Worship of the Devi1 is supposed to be
<>more than 4000 years old in India. In religious litera-
<>ture from Vedic times up to date Devi1 occupies an
<>important place. In modern India S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa, guru of Sva1mi1 Viveka1nanda, was a great
<>devotee of Durga1.
<NI>In the Maha1bha1rata there are various references to the
<>Devi1. When the Pa1n2d2avas entered the capital of Vira1t2a
<>for their life incognito they worshiped Durga1, who
<>appeared to them and granted them certain boons.
<>(Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 6). At the commencement of
<>the great war Arjuna, at the instance of Kr2s2n2a prayed
<>to Durga1, who appeared in the sky and granted him
<>boons, for victory in War. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 23).
<>See Pan5cadevi1s and Prakr2ti).
<HI>DURGA1 II. A river famous in ancient India. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas drank water from this river. (Bhi1s2ma Parva.
<>Chapter 9, Verse 33).
<HI>DURGA(M). Fort. There are six kinds of forts, viz.
<>Marudurgam, Jaladurgam, Pr2thvi1durgam Vanadurgam,
<>Parvatadurgam, and Manus2y adurgam. Among the
<>above six Manus2ya durga is the most important (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 56, 35).
<HI>DURGAJAM. A city in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma Parva,
<>Chapter 9, Verse 52).
<HI>DURGAMA. An asura chief born in the dynasty of
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a and son of Taru, Durgama was an enemy
<>of the Devas from his very birth. He argued to him-
<>self thus: “the very strength and power of the
<>Devas depend on the Vedas; if there is no Veda there is
<>no yajn5a, if there is no yajn5a the Devas do not get
<>their share of the havis, if they do not get the havis
<>they will lose all their strength and prowess, and, there-
<>fore, the best means to teach the Devas a lesson is to
<>destroy the Vedas.” Durgama decided that the surest
<>means to achieve that was to perform penance. Accor-
<>dingly he went to the Hima1layas and began doing
<>penance abstaining from food and drink. After a thou-
<>sand years Brahma1 appeared to him and asked him
<>what boon he wanted. Durgama said “I must get the
<>Vedas; I should get all the mantras known to brahmins
<>and Devas in the three worlds, and all the presiding
<>deities of those mantras should come and stand before
<>me and be subject to my control; I must also get the
<>strength to defeat all the Devas.” Brahma1 granted
<>Durgama all the boons. And, thenceforth the brahmins
<>could not recollect the Vedas or the mantras. No
<>bathing, no homas, no daily rites, no rites for the dead,
<>no yajn5as, no japa (repeating divine names) and no
<>tapas. Symptoms of old age caught the Devas in its
<>grips. Durgama drove them out of Devaloka and they
<>hid in mountain caves. Within a hundred years the
<>world reached the rock bottom of destruction. Water
<>disappeared from the world. Alarmed beyond measure
<>at these developments the brahmins went to the Hima1l-
<>ayas and prayed to Jagadambika1 (mother of the uni-
<>verse). Ambika1 appeared to them, and their lamenta-
<>tions brought tears to the eyes of Ambika1, and thus
<>water scarcity came to an end. Ambika1 gave them S4a1ka
<>(a vegetable) fruits and roots to eat. Because she pro-
<>tected her devotees by supplying S4a1ka to them she
<>came to be known as S4a1kambhari1, thenceforward. Also [Page255-a+ 65]
<>because she shed tears from her eyes, thenceforth she
<>came to be addressed as S4ata1ks2i1 also.
<NI>Being told about the above developments Durgama,
<>with his army attacked Devi1. The fight became fierce
<>and furious. From Devi1's body emerged numerous
<>S4aktis fully armed. Dha1rin2i1, Ba1la1, Tripura1, Bhairavi1
<>and Ka1li1 with 10,000 hands were some of the promi-
<>nent and powerful S4aktis which thus emerged. The
<>army of Durgama was annihilated. Then the fight
<>commenced directly between Devi1 and Durgama.
<>Fifteen arrows of Devi1 hit the asura at the very same
<>time and he was killed. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Saptama
<>Skandha).

<HI>DURJAYA I. An absolutely cruel King. Owing to the
<>number of adharmas (evil actions he had committed)
<>Ka1la ordained him to be born and reborn twentyone
<>times as various animals and as a Brahmara1ks2asa he
<>roamed about forests. One of those days he caught
<>hold of a S4i1vayogi1 called Maha1deva whose body was
<>smeared with Vibhu1ti (the sacred ash), but as soon as
<>the Vibhu1ti from the body of the S4ivayogi1 got smeared
<>on his body also, Durjaya got back his former form
<>and he was lifted upto Svarga. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Bhasma
<>Ma1ha1tmya).

<>and died. The place where he met with death came to
<>be known as Naimis4a1ran2ya in after years. (Vara1ha
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 17).
<HI>DURJAYA. Short form of Durjayman2imatinagara referred
<>to in laudatory terms in the Maha1bha1rata. Some
<>scholars hold that Durjaya is the Ellora caves of modern
<>India, seven miles off Daulatabad. (Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 96, Verse 1).
<HI>DURMADA I. See Durdhars2an2a.
<HI>DURMADA II. A son of Ham3sa, the Gandharva King.
<>Himself and Unmada1, the apsara1 woman impersonated
<>themselves and cheated Puru1ravas and Urvas4i1 (See
<>Unmada1). Enraged at the deception Urvas4i1 cursed
<>that Durmada be born as a Ra1ks2asa and Unmada1 a
<>princess. Also, Unmada1 as princess would have to marry
<>not the person she really loved but some one else.
<>Both Durmada and Unmada1 then begged Urvas4i1 for [Page255-b+ 65]
<>redemption from the curse and the latter said thus:
<>“This Durmada will be born as son of Unmada1, and
<>on seeing her son and husband die, she will end her
<>life by burning herself, and her soul will attain Svarga”.
<NI>As a result of the above curse Unmada1 was born as
<>the daughter of the King of Videha and Durmada as
<>the son of the Ra1ks2asa called Di1rghajam3gha. As Ra1ks2asa,
<>Durmada was called Pin3gala1ks2a. The King of Videha
<>named Unmada1 as Harin2i1.
<NI>While Harin2i1 was once walking in the garden with her
<>companions Pin3gala1ks2a abducted her and flew off in
<>the sky, and put her in a great forest. A prince called
<>Vasumanas, who happened to come that way on his
<>fast-riding horse Ji1mu1ta heard the lamentations of
<>Harin2i1, and after killing Pin3gala1ks2a he took her with
<>him to her palace. The King of Videha and his sub-
<>jects, who were in great anxiety and distress at the
<>disappearance of Harin2i1 felt really happy to have her
<>back. And, all of them opined that Harin2i1 should be
<>married to Vasumanas. Accordingly the date for her
<>Svayam3vara was announced. But, on the day of the
<>svayam3vara Bhadras4ren2ya, King of Hehaya who, along
<>with other Kings was also present on the occasion,
<>forcibly took Harin2i1 and rode off with her. According
<>to the condition laid down by Urvas4i1 for redemption
<>from her curse Durmada was born as son of Harin2i1 and
<>he was named Durmada.
<NI>Bhadras4ren2ya, Harin2i1 and Durmada lived very happily
<>in the Hehaya palace. When Durmada came of age he
<>married Citra1n3gi1, his uncle's daughter on the advice
<>of sage Garga. Soon war broke out between Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya, and Divoda1sa, King of Ka1s2i in which Bhadra-
<>s4ren2ya was killed. Harin2i1 courted death by fire,
<>regained her former life and under the name Unmada1
<>returned to the world of the Apsaras.
<HI>DURMADA III. Son of Asura Maya. Conceited and
<>haughty over his strength Durmada once challenged
<>Ba1li to fight, and defeated by Ba1li he ran away from
<>battlefield and hid in a cave. (A1nanda Ra1ma1yan2a
<>Sa1raka1n2d2a).

<>Ks2i1ra1bdhi (ocean of milk), many excellent things emer-
<>ged out of it. When those things were divided among
<>them all, Devendra took possession of 14 gems in an
<>unauthorised manner. When Jalandhara, through his
<>messenger Durva1ran2a, demanded Devendra to return
<>the gems, not only did he not return them but he also
<>declared war against Jalandhara. When war broke out
<>Jalandhara hesitated as to whether he should fight
<>with Vis2n2u or with S4iva. Durva1ran2a advised him first
<>to fight with S4iva. (Padma Pura1n2a, Uttarakhan2d2a,
<>Chapter 16).
<HI>DURVA1SAS
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A sage, who used to lose his temper
<>very easily. He is believed to have been born from an
<>am3s4a (part, aspect) of S4iva. [Page256-b+ 65]
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Three different stories are told in the
<>Pura1n2as relating to his birth.
<NI>(1) Once a quarrel, arose between Brahma1 and S4iva
<>which developed into fighting, At the sight of S4iva
<>seething with rage the Devas ran off frightened, and
<>Pa1rvati1 also got frightened. She told him ‘Durva1sam
<>bhavati me’. (It has become impossible for me to live
<>happily with you). Realising that it was his momentary
<>anger which made life miserable for Pa1rvati1 S4iva
<>decided to transfer that trait of his character to some-
<>one else.
<NI>The incident took place during the life period of
<>S4i1lavati1, who was very much reputed for her chastity.
<>While S4i1lavati1 was carrying her husband Ugras4ravas
<>(who though a leper yet desired to visit brothels) to
<>the house of a prostitute the muni An2uma1n2d2avya
<>cursed Ugras4ravas to die before sunrise the next day
<>with his head broken. (See under An2uma1n2d2avya).
<>S4i1lavati1 made the counter curse, let not the sun rise the
<>next day, to the muni's curse. Accordingly the sun did
<>not rise the next day, and confusion prevailed every-
<>where, whereupon the Trimu1rtis and the Devas, through
<>Anasu1ya1, the wife of Atrimahars2i, got the curse of
<>S4i1lavati1 withdrawn. Pleased at this the Trimu1rtis
<>asked Anasu1ya1 to choose any boon she desired, and she
<>prayed that Brahma1, Vis2n2u and Mahes4vara take their
<>partial incarnations through her. Accordingly Brahma1
<>as Candra and Maha1vis2n2u as Datta1treya were born as
<>sons of Anasu1ya1. And, S4iva deposited his anger, which
<>had caused unhappiness to Pa1rvati1, in Anasu1ya1. The
<>child born out of that aspect of S4iva to Anasu1ya1 was
<>Durva1sas. The name Durva1sas was very apt as the
<>child was born out of the anger of S4iva which had
<>made life miserable (durva1sa) for Pa1rvati1. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 44).
<NI>(2) Once defeated in his fight with Brahma1 S4iva took
<>refuge with the Narana1ra1yan2as who were doing penance
<>in the plains of the Hima1layas. S4iva told sage
<>Na1ra1yan2a everything about his plight and he asked the
<>former to pierce his left hand with the S4u1la. S4iva did
<>so and three streams of blood flowed out of the wound
<>made on the hand of the R2s2i, one stream towards the
<>sphere of the stars, another into the skull in S4iva's
<>hand and from the third stream Durva1sas was born.
<>Brahma1, who witnessed this miracle withdrew from
<>war and returned to his abode. (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 2).
<NI>(3) In the fierce fight with the Tripuras S4iva, in great
<>rage, ultimately shot an arrow against them, and that
<>arrow, after killing the Tripuras, assumed the form of
<>a child and returned to the lap of S4iva, and the child
<>was named Durva1sas. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 160, Verses 14, 15).
<NI>3) {%Kunti1 granted boon.%} Once while Kunti1 was living in
<>the palace of Kuntibhoja Durva1sas came there, and
<>pleased with Kunti1, he granted her five mantras. It
<>was with the aid of those mantras that Kunti became
<>mother of Karn2a and others. (For details see under
<>Kunti Para 2).
<NI>4) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a bathed in pa1yasa (pudding).%} Once Durva1sas
<>came to Dva1raka1 where Kr2s2n2a and Rukmini1 looked
<>after him to his heart's content. Though, at times he
<>took only meagre food, at other times he destroyed
<>everything he saw and created trouble. Kr2s2n2a and
<>Rukmin2i1 served him according to schedule. One day [Page257-a+ 65]
<>the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to cook some pudding and it was
<>got ready. Then the sage asked Kr2s2n2a to smear his
<>(Kr2s2n2a) body with pudding. Kr2s2n2a did so except on
<>his feet. After that Durva1sas got down the chariot and
<>making Kr2s2n2a and Rukmin2i1 serve as horses himself got
<>into it and drove away in great speed into the forest.
<>On the way he thrashed the ‘horses’ one ofter the
<>other. Neither Kr2s2n2a nor Rukmin2i1 felt sorry about this
<>action of the sage. On reaching the forest he halted
<>the chariot and blessed S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a that arrows would
<>not hit the parts of Kr2s2n2a's body which were smeared
<>with the pa1yasa. The spot at which the sage blessed
<>Kr2s2n2a became famous as Varada1nati1rtha in after years.
<>It may be noted that Kr2s2n2a died by an arrow hitting
<>his foot which was not smeared with the pa1yasa. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 160).
<NI>5) {%Conducted yajn5a for S4vetaki.%} There once was a King
<>called S4vetaki equal to Indra. He conducted a yajn5a
<>of a hundred years' duration. Innumerable brahmins
<>were engaged in the successful conduct of the yajn5a.
<>Some years after the yajn5a began the brahmins went
<>their own way leaving it unfinished as the clouds of
<>fume all the twentyfour hours in the yajn5as4a1la1 irked
<>and affected their eyes. When S4vetaki requested them
<>to further cooperate to complete the yajn5a they
<>insultingly asked him to invite S4u1dras for it. Then
<>the King went to the Hima1layas and did tapas for
<>S4iva, who at last deputed Durva1sas to complete the
<>yajn5a, and under the mahars2i's aegis it was completed
<>within twelve years. On account of the constant offe-
<>rings of havis in Agni (fire) during the period Agni
<>fell a prey to indigestion, which was cured only after
<>it ate up the Kha1n2d2ava forest. (See Kha1n2d2ava dahana).
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 235).
<NI>6) {%Mudgala granted salvation.%} Once Durva1sas went to
<>sage Mudgala who was doing tapas in Kuruks2etra
<>taking food only rarely and demanded some food with
<>the object of testing his dharmavr2tti (righteousness).
<>The sage gave Durva1sas all the food he had with him,
<>himself starving, and Durva1sas left the a1s4rama after
<>eating a part of the food and smearing his body with
<>the rest of it. This process was repeated by Durva1sas
<>for six days, but Mudgala never felt or showed any
<>offence. Greatly pleased at the firm righteousness of
<>the King. Durva1sas blessed him to bodily ascend to
<>heaven. Immediately a vima1na (aeroplane) descended
<>from Vis2n2uloka and carried Mudgala in it to heaven.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 260).
<NI>7) {%Other information.%} (1) Durva1sas ran away in fear of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. (See under Duryodhana, Para 12).
<NI>(2) He suffered at the hands of Ham3sa and D2ibhaka.
<>(See under D2ibhaka).
<NI>(3) He advised S4aivapan5ca1ks2ara to the woman called

<HI>DURYODHANA I. Villain in the Maha1bha1rata story;
<>the eldest and greatest of the Kauravas.
<NI>(1) {%Genealogy.%} See under Kauravas.
<NI>(2) {%Birth.%} Dhr2tara1s2t2ra born blind married Ga1ndha1ri1.
<>Hungry and thirsty, Vya1sa once came to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra's
<>palace where Ga1ndha1ri1 treated him sumptuously, and
<>he blessed her to have hundred sons by her husband.
<>Ere long Ga1ndha1ri1 conceived, but even after two years
<>she did not deliver. Grief-stricken at this she got
<>herself aborted in secret as the result of which she
<>‘delivered’ a mass of flesh, and hearing about it Vya1sa
<>visited her. As instructed by him hundred pots were filled
<>with ghee, and the mass of flesh was sprayed with cold
<>water as a result of which it got divided into hundred
<>pieces, each the size of a thumb. Also a smaller piece of
<>flesh remained. Those pieces of flesh were deposited in the
<>pots filled with ghee and the pots kept in a secret place.
<>Vya1sa departed for the Hima1layas for tapas.
<NI>In course of time the pots burst open one by one and
<>from each pot emerged a boy. From the 101st pot a girl
<>was born. Eldest among the boys was named
<>Duryodhana, and the girl called Dus4s4ala1. (For other
<>names see under Kauravas).
<NI>Duryodhana, at the time of his birth cried in the voice
<>of an ass on hearing which the asses kept in their shed
<>also cried. Also, such evil omens as the jackal howling,
<>birds like crows, vultures etc. crying and storms break-
<>ing out were witnessed on the occasion. Alarmed by
<>such evil omens Dhr2tara1s2t2ra sent for the brahmins and
<>his other friends and well-wishers like Bhi1s2ma and Vidura
<>and enquired of them whether, after the death of
<>Dharmaputra, Duryodhana would be able to become
<>King. As soon as Dhr2tara1s2t2ra had asked the question, evil
<>omens like the world becoming dim, jackals howling etc.
<>were witnessed again. Scholars like Vidura did their best
<>to divine what the future of Duryodhana would be, and
<>after mature consideration Vidura and the brahmin
<>pandits opined that because of Duryodhana's birth the
<>country and people would be ruined, and they, there-
<>fore advised that he should be cast away and forsaken.
<>But, paternal affection did not permit Dhr2tara1s2t2ra to
<>accept the advice.
<NI>During this period Ga1ndha1ri1 was laid up for a few days
<>with stomach trouble, and a vais4ya woman was engaged [Page258-a+ 65]
<>to look after Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, who begot of her a son called
<>Yuyutsu.
<F>1. Vya1sa blessed Ga1ndha1ri1 to have 100 sons. Then how was it that she got a daughter too? On being questioned thus by King
<>Janamejaya Vais4am3pa1yana replied “when Vya1sa was dividing the mass of flesh a desire to have a daughter entered the heart of Ga1ndha1ri1
<>and divining that desire Vya1sa cut the flesh in such a manner as to have one more piece, viz. 101</F> Thus with 100 sons and Dus4s4ala1 for daughter
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra became rich in the matter of children
<F>2. Duryodhana was born as a part of Kali. (M.B. A1s4rama va1sika Parva, Chapter 1).</F>
<>(M.B. Adi Parva, Chapter 114).
<NI>(2) {%Duryodhana harms Bhi1masena.%} Now, Pa1n2d2u was
<>dead and Ma1dri1 also died in the funeral pyre of her
<>husband. Forlorn and helpless Kunti1 and her five sons
<>came to Hastina1pura, and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra welcomed them
<>to the palace. Thus arose the occasion for the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas to live together in the Hastina1-
<>pura palace. And, naturally there used to be petty
<>differences and quarrels between the Pa1n2d2ava and
<>Kaurava princes. Bhi1ma being in every way a giant the
<>Kauravas had often to suffer at his hands. To collect all
<>the hundred Kaurava brothers together and throw them
<>away in one lump to push them to the ground, to suffo-
<>cate them by holding their heads under water etc--these
<>were some of the childish pranks played by Bhi1ma on
<>the Kauravas. The constant repetition of such pranks
<>and mischiefs on the part of Bhi1ma rendered him an
<>object of hatred for the Kauravas among whom the
<>common conviction grew that it was essential to put an
<>end to Bhi1ma's life for their safety, nay even their very
<>existence.
<NI>One day, the Kauravas, with the object of doing away
<>with Bhi1ma, escorted the Pa1n2d2avas to Prama1n2akot2i on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for water sports. There all of
<>them ate sumptuous meals and took various drinks. But,
<>Duryodhana had secretly mixed Ka1laku1t2a poison in the
<>food of Bhi1ma. After taking meals they began playing
<>water-sports. After the sports were over they returned
<>to their tents and slept. Owing to the effects of the
<>poison and the overexertion during the day Bhi1ma
<>slept stone dead. While all were asleep during the night
<>Duryodhana bound the hands and legs of Bhi1ma with
<>cords and threw him into the depths of the Ga1n3ga1.
<>Bhi1ma who was still unconscious sank down to the very
<>bottom of the river where the denizens of na1galoka saw
<>him and the na1gas bit him in anger. The poison of the
<>na1gas neutralised the effects of Ka1laku1t2a poison in
<>Bhi1ma, though their bite could not make even a scratch
<>on his skin. Freed thus from the effects of poison Bhi1ma
<>shook himself up from sleep and drove off the na1gas.
<>Alarmed at these developments the na1gas called Va1suki
<>up to the scene, and he, recognising Bhi1ma held him in
<>embrace and gave him much money and costly gems
<>etc. Bhi1ma refused the gifts, but asked Va1suki for na1ga-
<>rasa, which would impart the strength of thousand na1gas
<>to those who used it. Va1suki gave Bhi1ma eight potfuls
<>of na1garasa, which the latter drank to the last dregs
<>and thus gained immeasurable strength.
<NI>When next morning after the water-sports the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and the Kauravas awoke from sleep Bhi1ma was found
<>missing. Duryodhana said that Bhi1ma had returned
<>earlier to Hastina1pura, but this did not satisfy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. Kunti1 lamented over the absence of Bhi1ma.
<NI>Bhi1ma, who drank the na1ga rasa lay on the veranda of
<>Va1suki for eight days in the manner of one who had
<>lost consciousness. By the time he woke up on the eighth
<>day the body had almost fully assimilated the rasa.
<>Va1suki told Bhi1ma that eight potfuls of na1garasa [Page258-b+ 61]
<>would impart the strength of 10,000 elephants. And
<>then at the instance of Va1suki Bhi1ma took his bath in
<>holy waters and wore new clothes and fragrant garland.
<>He ate the pudding offered by Va1suki, and taking leave
<>of him and followed by na1gas he came up from the
<>water to the bank of the Gan3ga1. Bhi1ma gave a detailed
<>description to his mother and brothers of all that had
<>happened to him. Dharmaputra advised him to keep
<>the secret. After the incident, once again was Ka1laku1t2a
<>poison mixed in the food of Bhi1ma. But, Yuyutsu born
<>of the vais4ya woman to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra gave the Pa1n2d2avas
<>confidential report about it. Because of the powerful
<>effect of na1ga rasa, the Ka1laku1t2a consumed by Bhi1ma
<>did no harm to him but it only got assimilated in his
<>body. On another occasion Duryodhana killed the
<>charioteer of Bhi1ma. (Bha1s2a1 Bha1rata, Chapter 127 and
<>129).
<NI>3) {%Karn2a crowned king of An3ga.%} The Kauravas and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas learnt the use of weapons of war at the feet
<>of Dron2a1ca1rya, and when the studies were over arrange-
<>ments were made for a rehearsal, and at the rehearsal
<>Bhi1ma and Duryodhana were the first to clash with
<>each other. When the encounter reached its climax
<>both of them pointed the club at each other. But, As4vat-
<>tha1ma1 intervened and pacified them. Next Karn2a enter-
<>ed the stage for a trial of strength with Arjuna, and
<>at once arose from the Pa1n2d2ava side questions about
<>Karn2a's nobility and aristocracy of birth etc. Karn2a
<>stood there stunned, not knowing what to say or how
<>to repel the attack. Then it was Duryodhana who rose
<>up to announce that he was, that very moment, crowning
<>Karn2a King of An3ga. This ended the scene. (Bha1rata
<>(Malaya1lam), A1di Parva, Chapters 134, 135 and 136).
<NI>4) {%Pa1n2d2avas trapped in palace built of lac.%} The above
<>incident confirmed and completed the cleavage of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas into two hostile camps.
<>Meantime another event happened. Dron2a1ca1rya demand-
<>ed of his pupils to bring before him King Drupada
<>by way of gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee), for the a1ca1rya had
<>to wreak vengeance upon Drupada (See under Dron2a).
<>Though Duryodhana tried his best he could not capture
<>Drupada. Not only that, Drupada defeated him also in
<>fight. At this junture it was Arjuna who presented
<>Drupada as captive to Dron2a by way of gurudaks2in2a1.
<>The incident proved to be another provocation for
<>Duryodhana to hate the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>Now, Duryodhana made up his mind to destroy the
<>Pa1n2d2avas somehow or other. With this end in view he
<>went to his father, posing himself to be a great well-
<>wisher of the Pa1n2d2avas, and obtained his permission to
<>transfer their (Pa1n2d2avas') residence to another palace.
<>Accordingly Duryodhana deputed his minister Purocana
<>to get built at Va1ran2a1vata a palace of lac. Vidura came
<>to know of the intended mischief and gave advance
<>notice of it to the Pa1n2d2avas through a messenger
<>Kanaka. The architect built the ‘lac palace’ but built a
<>tunnel also attached to it. A year after the Pa1n2d2avas shift-
<>ed the residence to the new ‘palace’ Duryodhana set.
<>fire to it, and the Pa1n2d2avas escaped unscathed through
<>this tunnel. (Bha1rata (Malaya1lam) A1di Parva, Chapters
<>141-151). [Page259-a+ 64]
<NI>5) {%Duryodhana invited the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hastina1pura.%}
<>Duryodhana and his brothers were living very happily
<>under the impression that the Pa1n2d2avas had been burnt
<>to ashes along with the ‘lac Palace’. Then it was that
<>the Pa1n2d2avas, disguised as brahmins and in the presence
<>of all the Kings, won Pa1n5ca1li1, the daughter of King
<>Drupada, in svayam3vara, for their wife. After the
<>marriage the Pa1n2d2avas stayed in Drupada's palace and
<>the Kauravas returned to Hastina1pura. Duryodhana
<>and others felt all the more jealous at the Pa1n2d2avas'
<>becoming more powerful as a result of their marriage.
<>Again it was decided that the Pa1n2d2avas should be des-
<>troyed anyhow and at any cost. But, how to effect the
<>destruction? Duryodhana wanted to attract the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas to destruction through women and to create diffe-
<>rences and divisions among them. But, Karn2a attacked
<>the plan as impracticable, and instead he wanted to
<>defeat Drupada and render the Pa1n2d2avas impotent. At
<>this stage Bhi1s2ma and Dron2a argued that it was most
<>preferable to give half the Kingdom to the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and receive them with grace. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra supported
<>the proposal as a result of which the Kauravas went to
<>Pa1n5ca1la and escorted the Pa1n2d2avas back to Hasti-
<>na1pura. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra partitioned the country between
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas and the latter shifted
<>their residence to their part of the country with Kha1n2-
<>d2avaprasth2a (Indraprastha) as its capital. When the
<>Pa1n2d2avas went to Indraprastha Maya built for them
<>an2 exceptionally beautiful palace where King Dharma-
<>putra performed {%ra1jasu1ya.%} Duryodhana and others ear-
<>nestly participated in it. After the ra1jasu1ya the Kaura-
<>vas wanted to have a look at the palace and in the
<>course of surveying it they placed themselves in
<>ridiculous situations due to visual illusions. Taking the
<>bright floors of glass for watery tanks they pulled up
<>their clothings and measured with caution every foot of
<>theirs. Then they mistook actual pools for floor and fell
<>into them and got wet. At the consequent discomfiture
<>of the Kauravas Bhi1ma clapped his hands and roared
<>with laughter. Draupadi1 hid her face with hands and
<>smiled. Altogether the Kauravas cut a very ridiculous
<>figure, and they returned to Hastina1pura. (M.B. A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 202, Sabha1 Parva, Chapters 35, 85).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's first defeat in the game of dice.%} The
<>sight of the great wealth including costly stones and
<>gems presented by various kings to Dharmaputra at the
<>Ra1jasu1ya and the humiliation experienced while survey-
<>ing the palace made Duryodhana all the more mad
<>with anger and hatred towards the Pa1n2d2avas. He now
<>came to the decision either to defeat the Pa1n2d2avas once
<>for all or to commit suicide by taking poison. He held
<>secret consultations on the topic with S4akuni whose
<>efforts at first to pacify him (Duryodhana) failed. Ulti-
<>mately S4akuni, an expert in the game of dice, advised
<>Duryodhana to invite Dharmaputra to a game, assuring
<>him that the rest he would take care of. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Vidura advised Duryodhana against the move, but he
<>did not yield. Finally Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, saying to himself
<>that nobody would change fate, agreed to Duryodhana's
<>proposal, and deputed Vidura to Dharmaputra to invite
<>him for the game.
<NI>Dharmaputra, in fact, did not like the game, but he
<>succumbed to the eloquence and persuasive powers of
<>S4akuni and at last agreed to play. Kings lined up the [Page259-b+ 64]
<>royal hall to witness the game. First gems were staked.
<>and Duryodhana won the game. Then 1000 golden niskas
<F>1. 108 suvarn2a weight, an ornament worn on the chest.</F>
<>and treasuries were offered to the winner. Duryodhana
<>won that game also. Next chariot with horses and next
<>to that 1000 maid-servants were staked and Duryodhana
<>won those games too. 1000 horses, 1000 golden chariots
<>with their horses, the horse decorated with gold presen-
<>ted by Citraratha to Arjuna, 6000 soldiers with their
<>arms and armaments--these formed the next successive
<>bets, and each game Dharmaputra lost. The next bet
<>was 400 copper vessels each filled with pure gold, and
<>Duryodhana won that game also. And, now Vidura
<>tried to dissuade Yudhis2t2hira from playing the game;
<>but neither he nor Duryodhana heeded the advice. And,
<>Duryodhana by foul play snatched from Dharmaputra
<>all his wealth, his kingdom and his brothers. Now, Pa1n5-
<>ca1li1 alone remained, and Dharmaputra bet her too
<>and played the last game and lost.
<NI>Duryodhana deputed his Su1ta, Pra1tika1mi, to Indra-
<>prastha, to fetch Draupadi1 but she sent him back. Next
<>Dus4s4a1sana was deputed and he brought Pa1n5ca1li1 to the
<>sabha1 dragging her by the hair. She was proclaimed to
<>be the maid-servant of the Kauravas. At last Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>intervened and sent back the Pa1n2d2avas along with
<>Draupadi1 to Indraprastha.
<NI>7) {%Second game and exile in the forest.%} Duryodhana and
<>others did not appreciate the intervention of their father.
<>He again conspired with S4akuni and it was decided to
<>challenge Dharmaputra to one more game. The condi-
<>tions to be stipulated were that the vanquished in the
<>game should stay in exile for twelve years in the forest
<>and live incognito during the thirteenth year, and if
<>found out and recognised during this period the whole
<>process of exile and life incognito would have to be
<>repeated. Duryodhana and S4ukuni approached Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra and said to him thus: “Dear father, the desire
<>for revenge at their defeat in the game of dice gnaws
<>at the Pa1n2d2avas' heart like poison. Also, they will never
<>forget our having dragged Draupadi1 by her hair. When
<>a suitable occasion arises they will take revenge on the
<>whole lot of us. Therefore, we want to challenge
<>Dharmaputra to a final game of dice, the condition
<>being that he who gets defeated should go in exile into
<>the forest for twelve years and then to live incognito
<>for one year. If we get defeated we will simply carry
<>out the condition on our part.
<NI>This request of Duryodhana appealed to his father, who
<>invited Dharmaputra once again for a game of dice.
<>Dharmaputra accepted the invitation, in fact, in spite
<>of himself. This time too Duryodhana won the stake
<>and the Pa1n2d2avas set out to the forest. Even at the
<>time of parting Dus4s4a1sana insulted Bhi1ma who retorted
<>thus: “You, mean fellows, you cheated my brother by
<>foul play. If I fail to tear your heart open in fight and
<>drink blood I do not want heaven. Moreover I will kill
<>Duryodhana, and Arjuna will kill Karn2a. S4akuni, the
<>expert in foul play in dice will be killed by Sahadeva.
<>We will meet in the 14th year from today at the
<>battlefield. Adieu.”
<NI>Thus did the Pa1n2d2avas depart for the forest. Kunti1
<>being too old Vidura took her to his house, and he
<>consoled her, lamenting over the separation from her
<>children. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva). [Page260-a+ 64]
<NI>8) {%Curse of Maitreya.%} The Pa1n2d2avas entered the
<>Ka1myaka forest where they were welcomed by the
<>sages. Among them Maitreya whom the misfortune
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas affected much started for Hastina1pura
<>for peace parleys. Vidura advised Dhr2tara1s2t2ra that
<>Maitreya's proposals should be respected lest he should
<>curse the King. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Duryodhana received
<>the sage with respect. And, the sage asked them to
<>recall the Pa1n2d2avas from the forest and live on friendly
<>terms with them. Duryodhana did not in any manner
<>respond to the advice of the sage, but stood there
<>absolutely mum tapping his thigh with his fingers and
<>making drawings with the fingers of his feet on the
<>ground. This the sage interpreted as an insult to him.
<>He stood up ablaze with anger and cursed Duryodhana
<>thus: “You will, sooner than later reap the conse-
<>quences of your false pride; your cruelty will invite
<>terrible war, and in the fight Bhi1ma will rend asunder
<>your thigh, which you struck with your fingers
<>just now.”
<NI>Greatly agitated over the curse Dhr2tara1s2t2ra prayed
<>the sage for redemption and the sage said: “if only
<>your son resorts to forebearance and peace the curse
<>will not take effect, otherwise it will come true.” And
<>after making this announcement the sage returned to
<>the forest. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 10).
<NI>9) {%The procession.%} While the Pa1n2d2avas were staying
<>in the Ka1myaka forest Duryodhana and others went
<>there on the pretext of looking after the cows. The
<>Gandharvas took them captive; but the Pa1n2d2avas
<>intervened and set them free. Feeling humiliated at the
<>mishap Duryodhana decided to end his life after crown-
<>ing Dus4s4a1sana as King. But Dus4s4a1sana did not agree
<>to the proposal. (For details see Ghos2aya1tra1).
<NI>10) {%Duryodhana's attempt at death and his trip to Pa1ta1la.%}
<>Humiliated at the procession thus and turning down
<>the advice of friends to return to the palace, Duryo-
<>dhana spread grass on the ground and lay down there
<>to die. As his death would spell disaster to the Da1navas
<>they decided to send him back to his palace for which
<>purpose they performed the Vaita1na sacrifice in Pa1ta1la.
<>While offering milk in the sacrificial fire a Ra1ks2asa
<>woman, Kr2tya1, arose therefrom, and at the instance
<>of the Da1navas she carried Duryodhana over to Pa1ta1la.
<>There they told him thus: “Oh Duryodhana, a part
<>of your body has been earned by us from S4iva by our
<>penance. That part of your body above the waist is
<>made of diamond. Therefore, arrows will not pierce
<>your body. Grieve not. Bhagadatta and other heroes
<>have been born to help you. Your great supporter
<>Karn2a is possessed of the soul of Naraka1sura.” These
<>words of the Da1navas instilled fresh hope in Duryo-
<>dhana, and he was taken back to his Kingdom by Kr2tya1.
<>This incident appeared as a dream to Duryodhana.
<>Bucking up confidence and courage again he returned
<>to Hastina1pura and continued to rule (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 252).
<NI>11) {%Duryodhana's Vis2n2u yajn5a.%} At this juncture Duryo-
<>dhana thought of performing a Ra1jasu1ya for which he
<>invited brahmins to the palace. After bestowing much
<>thought on the subject the brahmins pointed out that
<>there was no sanction for Duryodhana to conduct a
<>Ra1jasu1ya as his elders, Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Dharmaputra
<>were still alive. At the same time they pointed out that [Page260-b+ 64]
<>there was another Yajn5a called Vis2n2u Yajn5a as efficaci-
<>ous as Ra1jasu1ya which Duryodhana was competent to
<>perform. Accordingly Duryodhana performed the Vis2n2u
<>yajn5a and earned reputation among evil monarchs.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapters 256, 257).
<NI>12) {%Boon from Durva1sas.%} Once Durva1sas accompanied
<>by his disciples, came to Duryodhana's palace, and
<>Duryodhana decided somehow or other to befriend and
<>use the mahars2i as a weapon against the Pa1n2d2avas. He
<>housed the mahars2i and his disciples in the palace for
<>a few days and pleased them by careful service at which
<>the mahars2i asked Duryodhana to request for any boon
<>he desired. And, Duryodhana asked the mahars2i to
<>visit the Pa1n2d2avas one day in the forest with his disciples
<>when they had finished taking their meals. The
<>mahars2i agreed. And, this was the period of time when
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 had received the aks2ayapa1tra from Su1rya.
<>Everyday the pa1tra would produce enough food for the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the other people with them, but it would
<>become empty for the day after Pa1n5ca1li1 had eaten her
<>food. This was the nature of the aks2ayapa1tra.
<NI>Pa1n5ca1li1 had finished her meals one day when Durva1sas
<>and his disciples came to the Pa1n2d2avas. Not knowing
<>that Pa1n5ca1li1 had already finished her food Dharma-
<>putra welcomed the mahars2i and his disciples and
<>requested them to take bath in the Gan3ga1 and return for
<>their meals. Pa1n5ca1li1 was in a fix. The aks2ayapa1tra
<>would not produce any more food for the day, and if
<>not duly fed the mahars2i would get angry and curse
<>them. In this painful dilemma she prayed to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>for succour, and lo! he appeared and asked Pa1n5ca1li1 for
<>some food. She replied that the aks2ayapa1tra was quite
<>empty. But, Kr2s2n2a got from her the pa1tra and ate one
<>particle of Ki1ra (a leafy vegetable) which had stuck on
<>its side. That leafy substance fully satisfied his hunger
<>and thirst whereupon the hunger and thirst of Durva1sas
<>and his disciples were also quenched. Then Kr2s2n2a
<>asked Sahadeva to bring back the mahars2i and his
<>disciples from the bank of the Gan3ga1 and accordingly
<>he went there and invited them. Only a few minutes
<>had passed since the mahars2i and his disciples had felt
<>the satisfaction of a sumptuous meal. They were also
<>astonished to think how in such a short time food for so
<>many people could be cooked by Pa1n5ca1li1. They felt
<>rather anxious about the reaction which Dharmaputra
<>would evince in case they returned to him to say that
<>they required no food. Durva1sas realised only too well
<>that to quarrel with the Pa1n2d2avas, who enjoyed the
<>friendship and support of Kr2s2n2a was like playing with
<>fire. Therefore, the mahars2i with his disciples ran away
<>from the place secretly. Pa1n2d2avas waited long for the
<>mahars2i and his disciples to return fearing that the object
<>of Durva1sas might be to return at the untimely hour
<>and curse them. But, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a told them the details
<>about the mahars2i's departure and assured Dharma-
<>putra that he and his disciples would not return. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 263).
<NI>13) {%War against Vira1t2a.%} After twelve years' exile in the
<>forest the Pa1n2d2avas began their life incogni to at Vira1t2a
<>nagara. Ki1caka, brother-in-law of Ma1tsya, the Vira1t2a
<>King, was killed secretly by Bhi1masena, and news was
<>spread that Ki1caka was killed by a Gandharva.
<NI>None of the spies deputed by Duryodhana to spot out
<>the Pa1n2d2avas during their life incognito could gather [Page261-a+ 65]
<>any information about them. One of those days
<>Sus4arman, King of Trigarta, told Duryodhana that the
<>Vira1t2a King had lost his power and spirits due to the
<>death of Ki1caka and it was, therefore, the proper time
<>to attack the Vira1t2a country and subjugate it thor-
<>oughly. The idea appealed to Karn2a, who prompted
<>Duryodhana to war against Vira1t2a. The army was
<>fully mobilised. As an excuse for the war, at the ins-
<>tance of Duryodhana, Sus4arman, King of Trigarta
<>lifted innumerable cows of the Vira1t2a King. This
<>happened on the day on which the life incognito of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas was to have ended. And war started thus.
<>The Vira1t2a prince Uttara who spent his time in the
<>zenana in the palace appeared in the field of war.
<>Arjuna, under the assumed name of Br2hannala took up
<>the charioteership of Uttara. But, at the sight of the
<>vast Kaurava army Uttara fainted, and Arjuna hurried-
<>ly drove the chariot over to where his bow ga1n2d2i1va
<>was kept hidden, and with the bow in his hands Arjuna
<>jumped into the thick of the fight. A fierce war ensued
<>in which the Kaurava army was completely routed.
<>The life incognito of the Pa1n2d2avas was also over, and
<>Duryodhana became naturally anxious about the future
<>of things. (M.B. Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 65).
<NI>14) {%Preparation for war.%} Duryodhana refused to give
<>the Pa1n2davas, even after their return from twelve years'
<>exile in forest and one year's life incognito, even ‘as much
<>land as would hold a pin’, and war became inevitable.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas and Kauravas fought the great war which
<>lasted for eighteen days on the field of Kuruks2etra.
<NI>(1) {%Duryodhana went to invite S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Preparations for
<>the war were gathering speed and momentum. Both
<>the sides were on the look out for more friends and
<>allies. Being told that Arjuna had gone to Dva1raka1 to
<>seek Kr2s2n2a's support Duryodhana rushed to the place.
<>Seeing Duryodhana from a distance Kr2s2n2a lay on his
<>bed in a false sleep, and Duryodhana took his seat
<>on a stool at the head of the bed awaiting Kr2s2n2a to
<>awake from sleep. Soon after, Arjuna came there and
<>he stood at the feet of Kr2s2n2a with head bowed down.
<>When Kr2s2n2a awoke from sleep it was Arjuna whom he
<>saw first, and while exchanging greetings with Arjuna
<>he was told that it was Duryodhana, who had come
<>first. But when Duryodhana and Arjuna explained the
<>object of their visit he told them thus:--
<NI>“No doubt it was Duryodhana who came first. But, it
<>was Arjuna whom I met first. Since Duryodhana came
<>first and I saw Arjuna first I shall help both of you in
<>war. There is the adage that youngsters should be
<>given priority of consideration. So, Arjuna may indi-
<>cate his preference first. I shall give one of you an army
<>of 10 lakhs of warrlors as strong in body as myself,
<>and I shall stand by the other without arms and with-
<>out fighting. Arjuna may make his choice first. And,
<>he chose Kr2s2n2a for his side in the war while Duryodhana
<>was happy to get Kr2s2n2a's mighty army. (M.B. Udyoga-
<>Parva, Chapter 7).
<NI>(2) Duryodhana sought Balabhadra's help but Bala-
<>bhadra told him frankly that since he could not forsake
<>Kr2s2n2a he would remain neutral in the war. (M. B.
<>Udyoga Parva, Chapter 7, Verse 25).

<>have any effect. On the occasion Duryodhana, S4akuni,
<>Karn2a and Dus4s4a1sana conspired to take Kr2s2n2a captive.

<>son of King Khad2gaba1hu of Saura1s2t2ra is also mentioned
<>in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>Khad2gaba1hu had a famous elephant, which one night
<>broke its chains and escaped, and all the mahouts
<>could not chain it again. People in terror of the elephant
<>ran helter-skelter. Now, a brahmin was going that way
<>chanting verses of the 16th Chapter of the Gi1ta1, and even
<>though the mahouts warned him he did not change
<>his path. Instead he saluted the elephant by touching
<>its cheeks and proceeded on his way unhurt by the ani-
<>mal. The King felt great respect for the brahmin when
<>he was told that he owed his miraculous powers to
<>the 16th chapter of the Gi1ta1, and he took the brahmin
<>with him to his palace. The King gave him 100,000 golden
<>coins and received from him the Gi1ta1 mantra. He began
<>reciting daily certain verses in the 16th Chapter of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some time afterwards the King one day went to an
<>open ground near his palace accompanied by soldi-
<>ers and set the elephant free from its chain. Then,
<>unheeding the entreaties of the frightened people he
<>approached the elephant, saluted it by touching its
<>cheeks and came away unhurt. He could act in this
<>fashion because of his firm faith in the efficacy of the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1. And afterwards he placed his son, on the
<>throne and himself led a life of recluse repeating the
<>Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Some Pura1n2as have another version of this episode.
<>Dus4s4a1sana was a servant of Khad2gaba1hu's son and he
<>attempted to catch the elephant but was killed
<>by it. He attained salvation by hearing the 17th Chap-
<>ter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1.
<NI>Dus4s4a1sana, an idiot, betting a huge sum of money with
<>the junior mahouts of the elephant and unheeding the
<>warnings of several people once mounted the elephant.
<>Children agitated the animal and Dus4s4a1sana fell down
<>from its back. The angry animal stamped the fool to [Page264-b+ 64]
<>death, and its rage having not yet subsided it threw
<>around his bones. Dus4s4a1sana, who ended his life thus
<>was reborn as an elephant and was owned by King
<>Jayadeva of Ceylon for a long time. A great friend of
<>King Khad2gaba1hu, Jayadeva presented the elephant
<>to him. At the sight of its brothers and other relations
<>memory about its previous birth dawned on the eleph-
<>ant. And, it lived in great grief. After some days the
<>King presented the animal to a poet pleased at his
<>samasya1pu1ran2a (filling the three lines of a stanza in
<>tune with the fourth line given). The poet sold the
<>elephant to the King of Ma1lava as it got ill with
<>fever. In spite of the best treatment administered to it
<>the elephant seemed to be nearing its end. Without
<>either eating or drinking or sleeping the animal stood
<>motionless shedding tears day and night. One
<>day, the Ma1lava King visited the elephant when,
<>to the surprise of all assembled there, the elephant
<>spoke to the King thus: “Oh, King: if a brahmin
<>recites the 17th Chapter of the Bhagavadgi1ta1 I will
<>be completely cured of my illness.”
<NI>Accordingly a brahmin was brought. As soon as he
<>chanted the Gi1ta1 and sprinkled water on its head it
<>got rid of its animalhood, ascended the divine aero-
<>plane and shone forth like Indra. The Ma1lava King
<>also began daily reciting the Bhagavadgi1ta1 and within a
<>short time afterwards attained salvation. (Padma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 8).
<HI>DUS4S4I1LA1. A harlot who lived in Pratis2t2ha1na. One
<>Devada1sa was her husband. When Devada1sa had once
<>gone to the palace on some business Dus4s4i1la1 hid her
<>paramour, with the object of doing away with her
<>husband, on top of the ceiling of her room. He killed
<>Devada1sa while the latter was sleeping in the night.
<>Next day when people gathered at her house she gave
<>out the story that her husband was murdered by thieves.
<>But the people got the true story about the death of
<>Devada1sa from his four-year-old son and beat Dus4s4i1la1
<>to death. (Katha1saritsa1gara, S4aktiyas4olam3baka,

<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 17) gives Ilin as the name of Dus2yanta's father and Rathanti1 as that of his mother. It may be

<NI>{%His reign.%} Within a short period of time Dus2yanta
<>bacame the emperor of India. (A1di Parva, Chapter 68,
<>Verse 3). His empire extended up to the sea, and he
<>became an object of envy for other rulers. Under his rule
<>the four castes flourished in affluence. None was threa-

<>in due order, the clouds raining at the proper time etc.
<>“Like the ocean not getting agitated, and putting up

<NI>3) {%Marriage and birth of son.%} Once Dus2yanta set out
<>to a forest to hunt. Seated in his chariot, which moved
<>with the speed of Garud2a he came to a beautiful forest.
<>Weary with hunger and thirst the King, leaving the
<>attendants behind walked into the hermitage of the sage
<>Kan2va. Proceeding along the sand on the banks of
<>Ma1lini1 river and drinking with his eyes the beauties
<>of the hermitage he reached Kan2va's a1s4rama. ‘Who
<>is there in the a1s4rama?’ queried the King, whereupon
<>S4akuntala1, the foster daughter of Kan2va came out, and
<>in the absence of her father welcomed the guest.
<>Enchanted by the beauty of S4akuntala1, the King
<>questioned her about her lineage and she told him the
<>story about Vis4va1mitra's love for Menaka1, and Kan2va
<>bringing up their daughter. Dus2yanta felt deep love
<>for her, and in accordance with rules prescribed in
<>Dharma s4a1stras married her in the Ga1ndharva way. He
<>also accepted her stipulation that the son born to her
<>should become the next monarch. S4akuntala1 got preg-
<>nant, and after promising that she would duly be
<>conducted to the palace Dus2yanta returned.
<NI>No sooner had Dus2yanta left the a1s4rama than Kan2va,
<>who had been out returned to the a1s4rama. With his
<>divine eyes he understood what had happened in his
<>absence. Kan2va blessed S4akuntala1 that she would have
<>an excellent son, who would become an excellent
<>ruler of the world surrounded by the sea.
<NI>In due course of time S4akuntala1 delivered a son. Kan2va
<>did the rites pertaining to the birth of the child, and
<>named the child Sarvadamana. The child grew up to
<>become six years old, and Kan2va realising that the
<>further stay of S4akuntala1 and her son at the a1s4rama
<>would stand in the way of the child's welfare and pro-
<>gress sent the mother and the child to Hastina1pura,
<>the capital of Dus2yanta, attended by his disciples.
<>When they reached Dus2yanta's palace and sent word to
<>him about their arrival he, pleading ignorance about
<>his marriage with S4akuntala1, refused to receive her and
<>the child. Dus2yanta and S4akuntala1 hotly argued the
<>question. At last, when S4akuntala1, with swelling
<>emotions was about to leave the palace, a celestial voice
<>announced that Dus2yanta had, in fact, married
<>S4akuntala1, that Sarvadamana was his son and that he
<>(Sarvadamana) would become a great ruler under the
<>name Bharata. (A1di Parva, Chapters 69-74).

<>Pa1n5ca1las also. (A1di Parva, Chapter 94, Verse 33).
<HI>DU1TALAKS2AN2A(M). The word ‘du1ta’ has a special
<>meaning in Vis2avidya1. If a man is bitten by a snake,
<>the man who goes to the Vis2avaidya to speak to him
<>about it and bring him if necessary is called ‘du1ta’.
<>From the external signs and symbols of the du1ta and
<>from words spoken by him the vis2avaidya understands
<>whether the person bitten by the snake would die or
<>survive. These signs and words of the ‘du1ta’ are called [Page265-b+ 63]
<>laks2an2as. The following are some of the important
<>du1talaks2an2as.
<NI>(1) The caste of the person bitten by the snake and
<>the caste of the du1ta.
<NI>(2) The first word uttered by the du1ta. If it is the
<>name of the patient, it has a special significance.
<NI>(3) If the du1ta makes an incomplete sentence, it is a
<>significant laks2an2a.
<NI>(4) The things carried by the du1ta such as stick, rope,
<>knife.
<NI>(5) The colour of the clothes worn by the du1ta.
<NI>(6) The tone in which the du1ta speaks. These are the
<>laks2an2as from which the doctor knows whether the
<>patient can be cured. (Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Brahma Parva,

<NI>Once King Maha1bali, with a vast army of Asuras, went
<>to the realm of the gods and drove them out of heaven.
<>Aditi was much grieved at the misfortune that befell
<>her sons. Kas4yapa her husband asked her the cause of
<>her grief. She told him about the fall of gods, and
<>asked him for a remedy. Kas4yapa told her to observe
<>Dva1das4i1vrata. Aditi took Dva1das4i1vrata and Maha1bali
<>was pushed down to Pa1ta1la by Maha1vis2n2u who
<>incarnated as Va1mana. From that day onwards
<>Dva1das4i1vrata is considered to be holy fast. (Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 8).
<HI>DVAIDHI1BHA1VA. One of the six qualities, others being
<>Sandhi, Vigraha, Ya1na, A1sana, and Sam3s4raya. Sandhi
<>is to make peace with the enemy. Vigraha is war. The
<>journey to battle is Ya1na. A1sana is, not going for war.
<>Dvaidhi1bha1va is dividing his army into two, i.e. if the [Page266-a+ 63]
<>army rose against the King, he should bring one party
<>on his side and make the two parties fight with each
<>other. Sam3s4raya is to yield to the powerful. (Manu-

<>attack of Jara1sandha, the Ya1davas united themselves
<>under S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, and built a strong city in the western
<>islands. That beautiful city was called Dva1raka1. Kus4a-
<>sthali1, is another name of this city. The beautiful
<>mountain Raivataka stood as a fortress round the city
<>which was so strongly built that it was not possible
<>even for the gods to enter it. Even women could fight
<>sitting inside the forts. The fortress Raivataka was three
<>yojanas long. In each yojana three divisions of the
<>army were camped. In each yojana there were hundred
<>doors, with a strong army to guard each of them.

<NI>2) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a in Dva1raka1.%} Dva1raka1 was the abode of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a. It excelled even Amara1vati1 in beauty. There
<>was an efficient council of the leaders of the Ya1davas.
<>Da1s4a1rhi1 was the name of that council. Many Ya1dava
<>leaders S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Balabhadra and other luminaries
<>attended the council. The royal palace was as lumino-
<>us as the Sun and the Moon. Dva1raka1 was built by
<>Vis4vakarma1. There were ditches on the four sides of
<>Dva1raka1. There were four beautiful parks called
<>Nandana, Mis4raka Caitraratha and Vaibhra1ja. The
<>mountain Raivata acted as the eastern rampart of the
<>city. Three other mountains, Ven2umanda on the North,
<>Sukaks2a on the west and Lata1ves2t2a on the south acted
<>as natural forts. On the east of the city there was a
<>beautiful lake. The city had fifty main gates to which
<>sharp machine rockets, big iron wheels etc. were fitted
<>for protection. It had an area of 96 yojanas

<HI>EKA1DAS4I1. The eleventh day after a new moon or full
<>moon day. The vrata observed on this day is called
<>the Eka1das4i1 vrata. King Ambari1s2a observed very
<>strictly and continuously the Eka1das4i1 Vrata to obtain
<>the status of Indra. (See under Ambari1s2a). (Navama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata). This vrata would fetch food
<>for the hungry and salvation for those who are in
<>search of it. (Agni Pura1n2a). The method of observing
<>this vrata is detailed below:
<NI>Those who observe the Eka1das4i1 vrata should be on a
<>regulated diet excluding meat and avoid sexual acts
<>on the Das4ami1 day, the day preceding Eka1das4i1. On
<>both the Eka1das4i1 days in a month one should not take
<>any food at all. The period which combines Eka1das4i1
<>with Dva1das4i1 (the twelfth day) is called Hariva1sara
<>because of the presence of Vis2n2u at that time. That
<>is a good time for doing sacred yajn5as. That day where
<>there is only a small portion of Eka1das4i1 and the rest
<>Dva1dasi1 is the best day for yajn5as. Trayodas4i1 (the
<>thirteenth day) is good for breaking the fast. The day
<>which merges Dva1das4i1 into Trayodas4i1 is the best day
<>for breaking the fast. Do not observe the Vrata on a
<>day which combines Das4ami1 with Eka1das4i1. Hell is the
<>result if one does so.
<NI>Completely abstaining from food on the Eka1das4i1 day
<>you should take food on the Dva1das4i1 day. As you take
<>your food you should pray like this: “Bhun3ks2yeham3
<>Pun2d2ari1ka1ks2a s4aran2am3 me bhava1cyuta”. (Oh, Pun2d2a-
<>ri1ka1ks2a, I am going to break my fast. Oh, Bhagavan,
<>let you be my heaven). If an Eka1das4i1 comes on a
<>Pu1yam3--Pus2ya--day in the bright half of the month that
<>day should on any account be observed. That day would
<>give the observer unlimited good result and that
<>Eka1das4i1 is qualified as Pa1pana1s4ini1 (destroyer of all
<>evils). When Eka1das4i1 and Dva1das4i1 happen to combine
<>on a Tiruvon2am (S4ra1van2a) day the Eka1das4i1 is qualified
<>as Vijaya1. That day gives prosperity to devotees. It is
<>also called Vijaya1 if an Eka1das4i1 comes in the month
<>of Pha1lguna (March) on a Pu1yam3 (Pus2ya) day. The
<>wise extol this day as one promising crores of good effects.
<>On the Eka1das4i1 day you should do Vis2n2u Pu1ja1 which
<>is productive of universal happiness. He who does so
<>will acquire children and wealth in this world and
<>attain Vis2n2uloka on death. (Chapter 178, Agni
<>Pura1n2a)
<HI>EKA1DAS4ENDRIYA(S). S4rotra, Tvak, Caks2us, Jihva1,

<HI>EKALAVYA I. Son of Hiran2yadhanus, a King of the
<>foresters. He went to Dron2a1ca1rya to learn archery.
<>Dron2a1ca1rya refused to accept him as a disciple because
<>he was a S4u1dra. Undaunted he went to the forests,
<>made a replica of the preceptor in clay and standing
<>before it started practising archery. Soon he became a
<>matchless archer.
<NI>Some time later the Pa1n2d2avas went to the forests for
<>hunting. One of the hunting dogs wandering saw
<>Ekalavya and started barking. Ekalavya sent seven
<>arrows to its mouth and kept it open. When the dog
<>returned to Arjuna he was dumbfounded at the skill
<>of the archer and when he came to know the archer
<>was an unknown disciple of Dron2a his disappointment
<>knew no bounds. Dron2a had once declared that Arjuna
<>was the best and topmost of his disciples. Arjuna went
<>and complained to Dron2a1ca1rya. Dron2a1ca1rya called
<>Ekalavya to his side and asked him to give him as
<>‘Gurudaks2in2a1’ (fee to the preceptor) his right-hand
<>thumb. Without the least hesitation Ekalavya offered
<>his thumb to the guru and from that day onwards his
<>skill faded and he became inferior to Arjuna. (Chapter

<NI>1) {%General information.%} An ancient sage. He was the
<>son of the Mahars2i Gautama. He had two brothers,
<>Dvita and Trita.
<NI>2) {%How Ekata became a wolf by a curse.%} There is a story
<>of how Ekata and Dvita duped Trita in the Maha1-
<>bha1rata. When Gautama died Trita became the chief of
<>the three. Dvita and Ekata did not like this. Once all
<>the three were passing by a forest with a herd of cows for
<>a ya1ga. Trita was walking ahead and the other two were
<>following him with the cows. At a strategic point on the
<>way the brothers carried away the cows by a separate
<>route without the knowledge of Trita. When Trita
<>came to know of the loss he was greatly distressed. On
<>reaching the shores of the river Sarasvati1, he was frigh-
<>tened by a wolf and running to escape from the animal
<>fell into a dilapidated well. He performed a ya1ga from
<>where he lay. Assuming a creeper inside the well to be
<>Somalata1, Trita recited the R2ks and the devas responded
<>to his prayer. Devas like Br2haspati graciously appeared
<>before him and asked him to demand a boon from
<>them. Trita replied that his desire was to worship the
<>gods standing on the waves of the river Sarasvati1.
<>Accordingly the river was made to flow that way and
<>standing on the waves Trita worshipped the gods. After
<>that he went home and cursed his brothers and made
<>Ekata and Dvita into wolves.
<NI>3) {%Other details.%}

<HI>EKAVI1RA
<F>1. The genealogy of Ekavi1ra is stated differently in different Pura1n2as. Devi1 Bha1gavata states that Ekavi1ra is the son of Turvasu,
<>son of Yaya1ti and that he is the father of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna. It is not correct. The genealogy chronicled here is based on Agni and Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2as. According to that Yadu, son of Yaya1ti is the father of the grandfather of Ekavi1ra: Yadu--Sahasrajit--Satajit--Hehaya (Ekavi1ra).
<>Descending from Ekavi1ra--Dharma--Kun2i--Bhadrasena--Dhanaka--Krtavi1ra--Ka1rtavi1rva1rjuna. From the grandson of Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna,
<>Vr2s2n2i, starts the Vr2s2n2i dynasty.</F> (HEHAYA). A founder of the Hehaya
<>line of kings.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u: Atri--
<>Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Yaya1ti--Yadu--
<>Sahasrajit--S4atajit--Ekavi1ra (Hehaya).
<NI>2) {%Birth of Ekavi1ra.%} Once there was a King called
<>Revanta who was an intimate friend of Indra. One day
<>riding on Uccaih2s4ravas, Indra's horse, he went to
<>Vaikun2t2ha. Fascinated by the arresting beauty of
<>Revanta, Maha1laks2mi1 sat gaping for a while and did
<>not hear what Vis2n2u talked to her. Vis2n2u was offended
<>and lost his temper. Laks2mi1 was looking with interest
<>alternatively at Revanta and the horse when Vis2n2u
<>cursed her to be born as a mare on earth. Horrified,
<>shedding tears, Laks2mi1 begged for relief. Vis2n2u decreed
<>that she would return to Vaikun2t2ha after giving birth
<>to a son who would be equal in glory to Vis2n2u himself.
<>Maha1laks2mi1 came to Earth taking the shape of a mare
<>and lived in a forest situated at a point where the rivers
<>Ka1lindi1 and Tamasa1 meet and where once Su1ryapatni1
<>stayed and did penance. Meditating on S4iva she lived
<>there for a thousand divine years and then one day
<>S4iva and Pa1rvati1 appeared before her and asked her
<>what she wanted. She then said “Oh, Bhagavan, Maha1-
<>vis2n2u cursed me and made me into a mare. He has
<>decreed that I would go back after bringing forth a son
<>as glorious as Vis2n2u. From whom am I to bear a son
<>like this?” S4iva promised to find a solution and going to
<>Vaikun2t2ha sent Vis2n2u to earth in the form of a horse.
<>Vis2n2u came to Laks2mi1 and they lived together for some
<>time and soon a son was born to Laks2mi1. Leaving the
<>child in the forest both of them went back to Vai-
<>kun2t2ha. It is this child who later on became the famous
<>King, Ekavi1ra. It was because he was born of a horse
<>that he got the names, Hehaya and Haihaya. (Skandha
<>6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How Ekavi1ra came to the palace.%} It was at this time that
<>S4atajit, son of the grandson of Yaya1ti was doing
<>penance to obtain a son. He was also doing penance
<>in the forest situated at a point where the rivers Ka1lindi1
<>and Tamasa1 meet. One night a Vidya1dhara named
<>Campaka came with a Vidya1dhari1 named Mada1lasa1
<>and seeing the infant lying helpless in the forest took
<>it to Devaloka. Indra recognised it as the child born to
<>Vis2n2u and Laks2mi1 on earth while they were living as
<>horse and mare and so the Vidya1dhara put it back on
<>earth in the same place as before. Immediately Laks2mi1-
<>Na1ra1yan2as appeared before S4atajit doing penance there
<>and asking him to take care of a child lying helpless in
<>another side of the forest disappeared. Immensely
<>pleased at this S4atajit took the child to his palace and
<>brought him forth as his own son giving the child the
<>name Ekavi1ra. When the boy became a prince, S4atajit
<>crowned Ekavi1ra King and went to the forest with his
<>queen and after doing penance there for sometime
<>attained Vis2n2uloka. (Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>4) {%Ekavi1ra marries Eka1vali1.%} Once Prince Ekavi1ra
<>accompanied by the son of the minister went for a plea-
<>sure trip to the banks of the river Gan3ga1. It was spring
<>and the prince wandering about enjoying the sight of a [Page269-b+ 60]
<>flowery forest was soon arrested by the sight of a
<>sweet smelling lotus with a hundred petals blooming in
<>the river. By the side of the lotus was standing a
<>beautiful damsel weeping. The prince went to her and
<>asked her the reason for her weeping. After great per-
<>suasion she replied thus: “Oh, Prince, there is a country
<>not far from yours which is now being ruled over by a
<>very righteous King called Raibhya. His queen is called
<>Rukmarekha1. They had no children for a very long
<>time and so Raibhya conducted a Putraka1mes2t2i ya1ga.
<>When ghee was poured profusely into the sacrificial fire
<>the flames rose up to great heights and from inside the
<>flames came out a lovely maiden. The King named her
<>Eka1vali1 and bought her forth as his daughter. I am
<>Yas4ovati1 the daughter of the minister there. We were
<>of the same age and so I was asked to live with her as
<>her companion. She was very fond of lotuses and the
<>King constructed big ponds with lotuses in them for
<>her recreation. Yet she used to go to other ponds also
<>in search of lotuses.
<NI>One day we came to this side of the river Gan3ga1 to
<>play. Then a demon of name Ka1laketu came and kidnapp-
<>ed her. I followed her. She never surrendered to the
<>enticements and persuasions of Ka1laketu. Her father
<>wanted her to be married to Ekavi1ra, King of Hehaya.
<>Ka1laketu sent her to prison. Without knowing what to
<>do next I am standing here weeping.
<NI>Hearing this Ekavi1ra went to Pa1ta1la and defeating
<>Ka1laketu released Eka1vali1 and brought both Eka1vali1
<>and Yas4ovati1 to the palace of Raibhya. Pleased at this
<>Raibhya gave his daughter in marriage to Ekavi1ra.
<>Ka1rtavi1rya1rjuna was born in the family of Ekavi1ra.
<>(Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>ELA1PUTRA. A serpent born to Kas4yapa of his wife
<>Kadru1. This serpent was very intelligent. Once there
<>arose a dispute between Vinata1 and Kadru1 over the
<>colour of the tail of the horse of Indra, Uccaih2s4ravas.
<>Kadru1 argued that there were black hairs in the tail
<>while Vinata1 held there were none. Really there were
<>no black hairs and Kadru1 to win the argument wanted
<>her sons to go and hang on the hairs to create a black
<>colour. The serpents like Va1suki and others refused to
<>do so and Kadru1 then cursed them saying that they
<>would all be burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of
<>Janamejaya. To take measures to get free from this
<>curse a meeting of the serpents under the leadership of
<>S4es2a and Va1suki was held and in that assembly Ela1-
<>putra made a stirring speech. (Chapter 38, A1di Parva,
<>M.B.).
<HI>ELI AND PU1CCA. (Eli = rat, Pu1cca = Cat).
<NI>The story of the cat and the rat described by the poet
<>Kun5jan Nambia1r is from Katha1saritsa1gara. The story
<>in original is the following.
<NI>Once there lived on a big banyan tree near the city of
<>Vidis4a1 a mongoose, an owl, a cat and a rat. The mon-
<>goose and the rat lived in two separate hollows at the
<>foot of the tree, the cat in a cavity in the centre of the
<>tree and the owl on the branches at the top. Of these
<>the rat could be eaten by all the other three and the cat
<>could kill all the rest. The rat and the mongoose afraid [Page270-a+ 64]
<>of the cat did stir out only during night time and the
<>cat moved about day and night afraid of none wishing
<>to catch hold of the rat and eat it. Their common place
<>of activity was a rice-field nearby.
<NI>Once a forester laid a net to catch the cat and the cat
<>fell into the trap and lay there hanging inside the net.
<>The rat coming that way saw the plight of the cat and
<>jumped with joy. But soon the owl and the mongoose
<>came to the spot and seeing their enemy, the cat, impr2i-
<>soned rushed to catch hold of the rat. The rat then did
<>a very clever thing. It went and tore open the net
<>imprisoning the cat and when the cat jumped out of the
<>net the owl and the mongoose ran away and disappear-
<>ed. The rat went to its hole. This is a story to
<>demonstrate the fact that with a change in the situation
<>an enemy may turn out to be a friend. (Taran3ga 7,
<>Madanaman5cuka1lam3baka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>ELLU. An oil seed. (Sesame). Ellu originated from
<>the body of Kas4yapa. Because Ellu is born of the body
<>of Kas4yapa, King of R2s2is, it is considered as divine to
<>offer Ellu to anybody. (S4loka 10, Chapter 66, Anus4a1-

<HI>GA1LAVA. A celebrated sage.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} He was a son of Vis4va1mitra. He was a
<>brahmava1di1. (S4loka 52, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana Parva.
<NI>2) {%How he got his name.%} There is no record of his origi-
<>nal name in any of the Pura1n2as. He got his name
<>Ga1lava later. There is a story about this both in Devi1-
<>bha1gavata and Harivam3s4a. It is as follows:
<NI>There was once a King called Arun2a in the family of
<>Ma1ndha1ta1. Arun2a got a son and he was named Satya-
<>vrata. (It was this Satyavrata who later became the well
<>famed Tris4an3ku). When Satyavrata was a youngster
<>he once went inside the marriage hall of a brahmin and
<>kidnapped the bride. Furious at this evil deed of his
<>son the king sent him out from his palace and Satyavrata
<>roamed about aimlessly.
<NI>Nature protested against this deed of the King abandon-
<>ing his heir and there was no rain in the country for
<>twelve years. The people were all put to great trouble.
<>Among those who suffered were the wife and children
<>of Vis4va1mitra. Vis4va1mitra had at that time gone to
<>the shores of the river Kaus4iki1, for doing penance. The
<>family of Vis4va1mitra was in great distress living without
<>any means for food. The sight of the children crying
<>for food to appease their hunger pained their mother
<>much. So she decided to sell one child and feed the
<>others by what she got from the sale. It was better to
<>be without one child than all the children dying out of
<>hunger.
<NI>She made a rope out of darbha leaves and tying it round
<>the neck of one child took it to the market for sale.
<>Both the mother and child were weeping profusely on
<>their way. Satyavrata saw them and took pity on them.
<>When Satyavrata heard their sad story and knew that
<>the woman was the wife of Vis4va1mitra he told her
<>thus: “Oh, Venerable Lady, you need not sell this boy.
<>Untie the rope round his neck and throw it away. I
<>will look after your family till the return of your hus-
<>band. I will daily bring food for you all and hang it
<>on a tree near your a1s4rama.”
<NI>The mother was extremely happy to hear this and she
<>at once untied the rope round the neck of the boy and
<>the boy from thence became known as Ga1lava. (For
<>details see under Tris4an3ku).
<NI>3) {%Gurudaks2in2a1 of Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava continued his educa-
<>tion under his father. At that time Dharmadeva to [Page272-a+ 64]
<>test Vis4va1mitra came to him disguised as Vasis2t2ha.
<>Vis4va1mitra came out with rice to receive the guest but
<>by that time the guest had disappeared. But Vis4va1-
<>mitra remained there with the rice for hundred years
<>till Dharmadeva returned. All these years Ga1lava looked
<>after Vis4va1mitra's comforts. Vis4va1mitra was immensely
<>pleased with Ga1lava and allowed him to go away free
<>without any gurudaks2in2a1 when his education was over.
<>Ga1lava wanted to give some daks2in2a1 but Vis4va1mitra
<>refused to accept it. Ga1lava insisted on giving and then
<>Vis4va1mitra asked him to give whatever he liked but
<>Ga1lava wanted the Daks2in2a1 to be named. Disgusted
<>with this stubbornness Vis4va1mitra said “Go and get me
<>eight hundred horses each with one of its ears black”.
<>Ga1lava was shocked to hear the demand and greatly
<>worried roamed about in search of horses of the type
<>specified. Garud2a taking pity on his sad plight took
<>him to the palace of Yaya1ti. Hearing the story of
<>Ga1lava Yaya1ti sent his daughter Ma1dhavi1 with Ga1lava
<>saying that if she was given in marriage to any king he
<>would give him the eight hundred horses of the type
<>he required.
<NI>Ga1lava took Ma1dhavi1 to Haryas4va, a King of the
<>Iks2va1ku line of Kings. Haryas4va was doing penance
<>at that time to obtain a child. Ga1lava said that Har-
<>yas4va would get a son of Ma1dhavi1 and he should,
<>therefore, accept Ma1dhavi1 and give him in return eight
<>hundred horses each with one ear black. Haryas4va was
<>amenable to the terms but the only difficulty was that
<>he had only two hundred horses of the type specified.
<>Finding this difficulty Ma1dhavi1 said “Oh, Ga1lava
<>please do not worry on that account. I have a boon from
<>a brahmava1di1 sage that I would remain a maiden
<>even after delivery. So give me in marriage to this
<>King and get two hundred horses. After giving birth
<>to a son to this King take me to another King and
<>get two hundred horses from him and then to another and
<>thus by giving me to four Kings you can get the eight
<>hundred horses you require.”
<NI>Ga1lava liked this plan and so when Ma1dhavi1 gave
<>birth to a son he took her to Divoda1sa, Ra1ja1 of Ka1s4i1.
<>When a son was born to him Ga1lava took her to Us4i1nara,
<>King of Bhoja. Ga1lava thus got six hundred horses but
<>there was nobody else to give him the remaining two
<>hundred. When Ga1lava was contemplating as to what
<>he should do next Garud2a came to his rescue. He
<>advised Ga1lava to give six hundred horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>in lieu of the remaining two hundred horses to Vis4va1-
<>mitra. Ga1lava gave Vis4va1mitra the horses and Ma1dhavi1
<>and pleased with the gurudaks2in2a1 Vis4va1mitra
<>blessed Ga1lava. Vis4va1mitra got a son named As2t2aka
<>of Madhavi1. (See under As2t2aka).
<NI>4) {%Ga1lava and Citrasena.%} Ga1lava was once having his even-
<>ing prayers in the river when the spittings from the mouth
<>of Citrasena who was travelling by air above fell on
<>the pu1ja1 materials of Ga1lava. Ga1lava went and com-
<>plained to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of this and Kr2s2n2a in haste pro-
<>mised to bring before Ga1lava the head of Citrasena
<>before the sun set. Na1rada who heard this went and
<>informed Citrasena of Kr2s2n2a's vow. Citrasena was
<>frightened to death. But Na1rada asked him not to lose
<>hope and advised Sandhya1 and Vali1, wives of Citra-
<>sena, to approach Subhadra1, sister of Kr2s2n2a, for pro-
<>tection. Both of them went to Subhadra1 and made a [Page272-b+ 64]
<>grand fire-pit in front of her palace. Citrasena decided
<>to end his life by jumping into the fire and as he was
<>circling the pit his wives wept loudly. Since her hus-
<>band Arjuna was away from the palace Subhadra1 her-
<>self ran to the place from where she heard the cries.
<>When they saw Subhadra1 they begged for ‘Man3galya-
<>bhiks2a1’ (a boon to live with one's husband). Subhadra1
<>agreed to give them that. Then she heard their story
<>in full and only then did she realise that she had under-
<>taken to do the impossible. Yet, to help Subhadra1,
<>Arjuna agreed to protect Citrasena. When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>attacked Citrasena Arjuna defended. The fight then
<>ensued between Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a. Both had very
<>powerful and divine weapons and the world stood on
<>the verge of a collapse by their fight. Then Subhadra1
<>did a brave thing. She stood between the two and
<>requested for a cease-fire. Then S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a asked Citra-
<>sena to bow down and touch the feet of Ga1lava. Ga1lava
<>pardoned him. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>5) {%Tapoda1na.%} Ga1lava once gave Yaya1ti one eighth
<>portion of the goodness accrued to him by his long
<>penance. (See Yaya1ti for details).
<NI>6) {%Ga1lava gets a horse.%} Pa1ta1laketu, a demon, used to
<>give trouble to Ga1lava daily while he used to do
<>penance. Once this demon sent a deep hot breath to
<>the sky and then a horse fell from the sky. Soon an
<>unknown voice from air said, “This is a very strong
<>horse and it would travel many a yojana in an hour.”
<>Ga1lava took that horse and gave it to R2tadhvaja.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 59).
<NI>7) {%Other details regarding Ga1lava.%}
<NI>(i) He was an intimate friend of King Prati1pa. (S4loka
<>13, Chapter 20, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>(ii) He was a shining member of the court of Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira. (S4loka 15, Chapter 4, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iii) He shone in the court of Indra. (S4loka 10, Chap-
<>ter 7, Sabha1 Parva).
<NI>(iv) He conducted a discussion with Na1rada on the
<>true nature of real prosperity. (S4loka 5, Chapter 287,
<>S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(v) On another occasion he spoke to Dharmaputra on
<>the glory of the universe. (S4loka 52, Chapter 18,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vi) He swore before God to prove his innocence in
<>the lotus-theft involving Agastya. (S4loka 37, Chapter
<>94, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vii) S4r2n3gava who married Vr2ddhakanya1 was a son of
<>Ga1lava. (S4loka 14, Chapter 52, S4alya Parva). For
<>details see under Vis4vakarma1.
<HI>GAM. Music. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 348).
<HI>GAN2A1. A female attendant of Skanda. (S4alya Parva,

<HI>GAN2AM. An army division. Three Gulmas form one
<>Gan2am. (See Aks2auhin2i1).
<HI>GAN2APATI.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} A son of S4iva with face like that of an
<>elephant. As S4iva has appointed this son as chief of
<>the gan2as (attendants) he is called Gan2apati.
<NI>2) {%His birth.%} While S4iva and Pa1rvati1 assumed the form
<>of monkeys and enjoyed themselves in the forest Pa1rvati1
<>got pregnant, and S4iva took the semen from the womb
<>and gave it to Va1yu (wind God.) Va1yu deposited it in
<>the womb of An5jana1, who delivered a son named Hanu1-
<>ma1n. S4iva assumed the form of an elephant (tusker) [Page273-a+ 64]
<>and Pa1rvati1 that of a she-elephant. Pa1rvati1 delivered a
<>son in the form of an elephant. That son was named
<>Gan2apati. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%His tusk broken.%} Once Paras4ura1ma arrived at Kaila1sa
<>to meet S4iva. At that time S4iva was asleep. So Gan2a-
<>pati did not allow him to get in. A duel broke out
<>between them. In that duel one of Gan2apati's tusks
<>was broken. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>4) {%Gan2apati turned into crow.%} An exceptionally hot
<>summer set in once in South India. The whole land
<>became parched. So Agastya went to S4iva and request-
<>ed for some holy water, and the Lord put Ka1veri1 who
<>was worshipping him just then, in the Kaman2d2alu
<>(something like a teapot which sannya1sins carry with
<>them) of Agastya and sent him back. Indra, who did
<>not relish this action of S4iva, asked Gan2apati to some
<>how or other upset Agastya's Kaman2d2alu of holy water,
<>and Gan2apati, in the guise of a crow went and sat on
<>the brink of the Kaman2d2alu and thus upset it. Agastya
<>and the crow quarrelled with each other. Then did the
<>crow assume its original form as Gan2apati and blessed
<>Agastya. Moreover, Gan2apati filled Agastya's Kaman2-
<>d2alu with holy water, which the latter distributed
<>among devotees in South India, and that is the present
<>Ka1veri1 river.
<NI>5) {%Other stories about Gan2apati's head.%} The Pura1n2as
<>contain two different stories as to how Gan2apati hap-
<>pened to have the elephant's head. Once Pa1rvati1
<>pointed out to Gan2apati the planet Saturn, and his head
<>got burned down due to the ocular power of Saturn,
<>and according to one story Gan2apati's head thus lost
<>was replaced with that of an elephant. The other story
<>is more interesting. When once S4iva tried to enter the
<>room where Pa1rvati1 had gone to take her bath clad in
<>a single clothing Gan2apati prevented S4iva from doing
<>so. S4iva, enraged at the obstruction made by Gan2apati,
<>cut off his head, and when his anger was cooled down
<>he replaced Gan2apati's lost head with that of an ele-
<>phant. (Padma Pura1n2a).
<NI>6) {%Wedding of Gan2apati.%} Gan2apati has two wives called
<>Siddhi and Buddhi.
<NI>When Gan2apati and Subrahman2ya attained the age of
<>marriage they were in a hurry to get married. S4iva
<>conducted a test. S4iva and Pa1rvati1 told them that he
<>who returned first after going round the world would be
<>married first. Accordingly Subrahman2ya mounted his
<>vehicle (peacock) and set out for a tour round the
<>world. Gan2apati did nothing of the sort. But after a
<>little time he went round his parents, viz., S4iva and
<>Pa1rvati1. Asked for an explanation about his action
<>Gan2apati replied that since the whole universe existed
<>in S4iva and Pa1rvati1, going around them tantamounted
<>to touring round the world. Pleased at this reply his
<>parents got Gan2apati married first.
<NI>7) {%Vighnes4varatvam.%} (Power to remove all obstacles).
<>Gan2apati is called Vighnes4vara because he is the god
<>who removes all obstacles from the paths of men or
<>creates them.
<NI>Gan2apati has the power to get anything done without
<>any obstructions as also the power to put obstacles in
<>the path of anything being got done. Therefore, the
<>custom came into vogue of worshipping Gan2apati at the
<>very commencement of any action for its completion
<>without any hitch or hindrance. Actions begun with [Page273-b+ 64]
<>such worship would be duly completed, Indians believe.
<>In support of that belief the following story from the
<>6th taran3ga of La1va1n2akalam3bakam, Katha1saritsa1gara
<>may be quoted.
<NI>The Devas decided to appoint Subrahman2ya as chief
<>of the army to kill Ta1raka1sura. When Indra took up
<>the pot of water purified by mantras to anoint Subrah-
<>man2ya's head with it, his hands became benumbed, and
<>he stood aghast. Then S4iva said that any action begun
<>without Gan2apati pu1ja1 would meet with such obstacles.
<>At once Indra worshipped Gan2apati and his hands
<>recovered from the paralysed condition. And, Subrah-
<>man2ya was duly anointed with the holy water.
<NI>8) {%Gan2apati wrote the M3aha1bha1rata.%} After the death of
<>the Kauravas and the Pa1n2d2avas sage Vya1sa entered
<>again into meditation. But, the whole story of the
<>Bha1rata reflected in the mirror of his mind. He wanted
<>to translate the story into a great poem and requested
<>Brahma1 to suggest a suitable person to write the story
<>on his dictation, and Brahma1 suggested Gan2apati's
<>name. Then Vya1sa thought about Gan2apati and he
<>appeared before the sage. But, Gan2apati did not appre-
<>ciate the idea of serving as Vya1sa's scribe. So he stipu-
<>lated a condition that he would write down the poem
<>provided Vya1sa dictated it in such a manner that he
<>had not to lay down his pen even once before the epic
<>was completed. To this Vya1sa stipulated the counter
<>condition that when he dictated without the least inter-
<>ruption or pause Gan2apati should not write down the
<>matter without understanding the meaning of it. And,
<>under such conditions the composition of the Maha1-
<>bha1rata was completed within three years. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 1, Verses 74-80).
<NI>9) {%Gan2apati pu1ja.%} Gan2apati occupies the most promi-
<>nent place among the Devas connected with S4iva. In
<>South India, Gan2apati pu1ja1 came into vogue in the 6th
<>century A.D., and idols of Gan2apati now extant might
<>have been made at that period. In South India, temples
<>dedicated to Gan2apati are in no way less in number
<>than those to Subrahman2ya. The idol of Gan2apati is
<>installed at the gateways of villages and forts, under
<>the fig tree, at the entrance of temples and at the south-
<>western corner of S4iva temples. Two types of idols are
<>important: the Itam3piri (the proboscis turned to the
<>left side) and the Valam3piri (the proboscis turned to
<>the right side). It is stated that the enormously big
<>belly of Gan2apati contains in it the whole universe.

<>from the churning of Ks2i1ra1bdhi (the milk ocean) and
<>Maha1vis2n2u appeared in the form of Mohini1 and enti-

<>equal value as an As4vamedha yajn5a and he who bathes
<>in it will attain Su1ryaloka. (Vana Parva, Chapter 84,
<>Verse 113).
<NI>(v) Gan2d2aki1 is one of the rivers which were respon-
<>sible for the origin of Agni (fire). (Vana Parva, Chap-
<>ter 84, Verse 113).

<HI>GA1NDHA1RA. A stretch of land of ancient Bha1rata. It
<>is believed that this land stretched from the shores of
<>river Sindhu to Ka1bul. Subala was a mighty ruler of
<>this country. His daughter Ga1ndha1ri1 was the wife of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. (S4loka 11, Chapter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>Agni Pura1n2a points out a relationship between the
<>Ga1ndha1ras and the Dra1vid2as. Descending in order from
<>Vis2n2u were Candra--Budha--Puru1ravas--A1yus--Nahus2a
<>-Yaya1ti--Turvasu. In order from Turvasu were Varga--
<>Gobha1nu--Trais4a1ni--Karandhama--Marutta--Dus2ya-
<>nta--Varu1tha--Ga1n2d2i1ra--Ga1ndha1ra. From Ga1ndha1ra
<>arose the five different provincialists: Ga1ndha1ras,
<>Keralas, Colas, Pa1n2d2yas and Kolas. (Chapter 277,
<>Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1NDHA1RI1. Wife of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} There was a King called Subala in the family
<>of Turvasu, brother of Yadu. (For genealogy see under
<>Subala). Subala became the King of the land of Ga1n-
<>dha1ra. This land extended from the river Sindhu to
<>Ka1bul. Ga1ndha1ri1 was the daughter of Subala. (Chap-
<>ter 111, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Marriage.%} Ga1ndha1ri1 became a devotee of S4iva even
<>from her childhood. S4iva became pleased with her and
<>blessed her saying that she would bear a hundred sons.
<>Bhi1s2ma came to know of this and he planned to get her
<>married to Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. One day he sent a messenger
<>to Subala making a proposal. Subala knew that Dhr2-
<>tara1s2t2ra was born blind but considering his lineage and
<>the powerful alliance it would make, consented to the
<>proposal of Bhi1s2ma. S4akuni, brother of Ga1ndha1ri1, then
<>by the order of his father took Ga1ndha1ri1 to Hastina1-
<>pura and Dhr2tara1s2t2ra accepted her as his wife. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 obeying his father's instructions without a demur
<>accepted her blind husband with such devotion that
<>she made herself blind by tightly covering her eyes
<>with a silk shawl. (Chapter 110, A1di Parva).
<NI>3) {%Birth of Sons.%} Once Vya1sa came to her exhausted
<>with hunger and thirst. Ga1ndha1ri1 appeased his hunger
<>and thirst with tasty things to eat and drink. Vya1sa
<>was immensely pleased and he also blessed her and
<>said she would get a hundred sons. Very soon she be-
<>came pregnant. But even after two years she did not
<>deliver, while Kunti1, wife of Pa1n2d2u, gave birth to a
<>son. Grief-stricken, she hit hardly on her womb secretly
<>and then a great mass of flesh came out. Then Vya1sa
<>appeared before her and advised her to cut the lump
<>of flesh into a hundred pieces and deposit one each in
<>a jar of ghee. Vya1sa himself cut it into pieces. Ga1n-
<>dha1ri1 expressed a desire to have a girl also. Vya1sa cut
<>it into hundred and one pieces and put them in hundred [Page275-a+ 65]
<>and one jars of ghee. In due time the jars broke and
<>a hundred sons and a daughter came out of the jars.
<>The daughter was named Dus4s4ala1. For their name see
<>‘Kauravas’. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra got another son named Yuyu-
<>tsu. (Chapters 115 and 116, A1di Parva).
<NI>4) {%Ga1ndhari1 faints.%} When San5jaya reported about the
<>death of Karn2a at the battle both Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 fainted. (S4loka 55, Chapter 96, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>5) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 starts to curse the Pa1n2d2avas.%} When the battle
<>was over the sons of Ga1ndha1ri1 and their followers were
<>killed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra suggested that the Pa1n2d2avas should
<>visit Ga1ndha1ri1 and pay homage to her. The Pa1n2d2avas,
<>therefore, went and stood before Ga1ndha1ri1 very res-
<>pectfully. Vengeance boiled in her heart and her body
<>shivered. Ga1ndha1ri1 was about to curse the Pa1n2d2avas
<>when Vya1sa, intervened saying “Ga1ndha1ri1! Don't you
<>remember you said that victory would lie on the side
<>of the righteous in this war? Your words are not wasted.
<>The Pa1n2d2avas won the battle because right was on
<>their side. So why should you get agitated?” Ga1ndha1ri1
<>became calm on hearing these words and she admitted
<>that the end of the Kuru dynasty came because of the
<>mistakes of Duryodhana, S4akuni, Karn2a and Dus4s4a1-
<>sana. She, thereafter, treated the Pa1n2d2avas as her own
<>sons. (Chapter 14, Stri1 Parva, M.B.).
<NI>6) {%Dharmaputra's foot-nails become blue.%} Following the
<>instructions of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, the Pa1n2d2avas, approached
<>and bowed before Ga1ndha1ri1. She covered her face
<>with a cloth and wept, tears rolling down her cheeks.
<>When Dharmaputra bent to touch her feet the latter
<>saw through the veil on her face the foot-nails of
<>Dharmaputra. A few drops of the lachrymal water fell
<>on the foot-nails of Dharmaputra making them turn
<>blue instantly. (Chapter 15, Stri1 Parva).
<NI>7) {%Ga1ndha1ri1 curses Kr2s2n2a.%} At the end of the battle the
<>aggrieved Ga1ndha1ri1 went to Kuruks2etra together with
<>Kr2s2n2a and other relatives. Seeing mighty Kings on the
<>Kaurava side lying dead like huge trees lying truncated
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 burst into tears. She knew that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was at the root of all this. Embittered she looked at
<>Kr2s2n2a and cursed him. “Ho, Kr2s2n2a, thirtysix years
<>from this day you will lose your sons, ministers, friends
<>and relatives. You will become a lone walker in the
<>forests and be killed by trickery.”
<NI>It was because of this curse that the Ya1dava tribe perish-
<>ed and Kr2s2n2a was struck by the arrow of a hunter
<>which made him end his life on earth.
<NI>8) {%The end of Ga1ndha1ri1.%} After the great Kuruks2etra battle
<>heart-broken Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 accompanied
<>by Kunti1, Vidura and San5jaya went to the forests to
<>spend the rest of their life there. Many people and the
<>Pa1n2d2avas accompanied them up to the river Gan3ga1 and
<>there near the a1s4rama of S4atayu1pa Dhr2tara1s2t2ra made
<>a hut and lived with Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1.
<NI>The Pa1n2d2avas felt the separation of their relatives
<>unbearable and lived in grief. After six years one day
<>Dharmaputra saw his mother, Kunti1, in a dream. He
<>told his brothers about this and they all felt a desire
<>to go to the forest and see their mother. The next day they
<>reached the shores of Gan3ga1. Vya1sa also joined them.
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 expressed a desire to Vya1sa that
<>they would like to see the dead sons and relatives once
<>again. Vya1sa then asked them to go and take a dip
<>in the river. When they rose up after a dip they saw [Page275-b+ 65]
<>standing on the shores of the river the great warriors
<>Karn2a and Duryodhana and others. By the yogic power
<>of Vya1sa even the blind Dhr2tara1s2t2ra could get the vision.
<>Very soon the vision faded and the Pa1n2d2avas returned
<>to Hastina1pura.
<NI>Two days after, fire broke out in the forest where
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was staying. Dhr2tara1s2tra, Kunti1 and
<>Ga1ndha1ri1 were burnt to death in that fire. (Chapter 32,
<>A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>9) {%After the death.%} Dharmaputra performed the obsequi-
<>es of those who died in the wild fire (A1s4ramava1sika
<>Parva, Chapter 30). Leaving the mortal bodies the souls of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and Ga1ndha1ri1 entered Kuberaloka. (S4loka
<>14, Chapter 5, Svarga1rohan2a Parva).
<NI>10) {%Synonyms of Ga1ndha1ri1.%} The following words have
<>been used in the Maha1bha1rata to denote Ga1ndha1ri1;
<>Ga1ndha1rara1jaduhita1, Saubaleyi1, Saubali1, Subalaja1,
<>Subala1putri1 and Subala1tmaja1.
<HI>GA1NDHA1RI1 II. Another Ga1ndha1ri1, wife of Ajami1d2ha,
<>one of the great Kings of the Pu1ru dynasty. (S4loka
<>37, Chapter 95, A1di Parva).
<HI>GANDHARVA I. Gandharvas are sons born to the
<>famous Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife, Aris2t2ha1 (Agni
<>Puran2a, Chapter 19). Both belonged to the race of
<>the Devas.
<HI>GANDHARVA II. A King born in the dynasty of
<>Janamejaya. (Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<HI>GA1NDHARVA. A marriage settled by the boy and the
<>girl of their own accord. A love marriage. There are
<>six different kinds of marriage: Ga1ndharva, A1rs2a,
<>Pra1ja1patya, Ra1ks2asa, A1sura and Pais4a1ca. (See under
<>Viva1ha).
<HI>GANDHARVANAGARA. Vya1sa has compared munis
<>disappearing from sight to the fading out of Gandharva
<>nagara.
<NI>“After having thus spoken to the Kurus, and while
<>they were looking on, the band of sages disappeared
<>in a trice like the fading out of Gandharvanagara.”
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 126, Verses 35 and 36).
<NI>What is this Gandharvanagara? The following descrip-
<>tion occurs in Hindi S4abdasa1gara. “Owing to different
<>optical illusions (sight) of man, villages and cities may
<>appear to exist in the sky and also on seas, rivers, etc.
<>When during summer the air on the upper strata of
<>deserts, seas etc. gets heated, expanded, and rises up,
<>the light passing through it becomes multi-coloured and
<>gives reflections in the sky in the form of village parts or
<>cities. Also can be seen therein reflections of trees,
<>boats etc. One such reflection may be cast on earth
<>also. This is a mere optical illusion. This reflection
<>immediately fades out also. This unreal city which is
<>an optical illusion is Gandharvanagara.
<HI>GANDHARVASENA1. Daughter of Dhanava1hana (a
<>gandharva) who lived in Svayamprabha1nagara on
<>Mount Kaila1sa. She was cured of leprosy by observing
<>somava1ravrata. (Skandha Pura1n2a).
<HI>GANDHARVATI1RTHA. An ancient place of pilgri-
<>mage on the banks of Sarasvati in North India. The
<>gandharva called Vibha1vasu usually dances at this
<>place with his companions. Balabhadra Ra1ma once
<>visited this holy place. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 37,
<>Verse 9).
<HI>GANDHARVI1. The first mother of horses. Kas4yapapraja1-
<>pati had by his wife Krodhavas4a1 ten daughters: Mr2gi1,
<>Mr2gamanda1, Hari1, Bhadramata1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, [Page276-a+ 64]
<>S4veta1, Surabhi, Surasa1 and Kadru1. Of the ten girls
<>Surabhi in due course of time became mother of two
<>daughters. Rohin2i1 and Gandharvi1. From Rohin2i1 was
<>born the cattlebreed and horses were born from Gan-
<>dharvi1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Canto 14).
<HI>GANDHAVATI1 I. The name Satyavati1 (Ka1li1) was
<>assumed when sage Para1s4ara had swept away her
<>matsyagandha (fish smell). She got also another name
<>Yojanagandha1. (A1di Parva, Chapter 63, Verse 80).
<HI>GANDHAVATI1 II. The city of Va1yu (the wind God).
<>There are said to be nine cities on top of Mount Maha1-
<>meru: (1) Manovati1 of Brahma1 at the centre, (2) Just
<>on the eastern side of it Amara1vati1 of Indra, (3) Agni's
<>Tejovati1 in the south-eastern corner, (4) Maya's Sam3ya-
<>mani1 in the south, 5) Nirr2ti's Kr2s2n2a1n5jana1 in the-
<>south-western corner, (6) S4raddha1vati1 of Varun2a on the
<>west, (7) Gandhavati1 of Va1yu in the northwestern
<>corner, (8) Mahodaya1 of Kubera on the north, and (9)
<>Yas4ovati1 of I1s4a1na in the north-eastern corner. (Devi1-
<>bha1gavata, As2t2ama Skandha).
<HI>GA1NDINI1. A very beautiful princess of Ka1s4i1. S4vaphal-
<>ka married Ga1ndini1. (Das4ama Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>GA1N2D2I1VA. The famous bow of Arjuna.
<NI>1) {%Make.%} It was Brahma1 who made the bow. ‘This
<>terrible bow which can punish the unjust and the
<>wicked has been made by Brahma1’. (Udyoga Parva,
<>Chapter 98, Verse 21).
<NI>2) {%Specialities of Ga1n2d2i1va.%} This bow is enough to fight
<>one lakh of people at one and the same time. Both
<>Devas and men could be defeated with it. Chiselled
<>very smooth and shining with many colours it was a
<>very long bow. It was worshipped by Devas, Da1navas
<>and Gandharvas. (Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 43). It
<>gained and also decreased in power as the situation
<>called for. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 98, Verse 20).
<NI>3) {%History of Ga1n2d2i1va.%} Brahma1, who made this bow
<>kept it with him during the first 1000 years. For the
<>next 1000 years Praja1pati kept it with him. Next, Indra
<>got it from Praja1pati and he used it for 3585 years.
<>After that Candra kept it for 500 years with him, and
<>then Varun2a came in possession of it. After using it for
<>100 years Varun2a gave it to Arjuna, who used it for 65
<>years.
<NI>4) {%Ga1n2d2i1va and Arjuna.%} Arjuna agreed to protect the
<>Kha1n2d2ava forest from rain, if Indra sent rain when
<>Agni began eating the forest. But, realising that Arjuna
<>possessed no weapons to effectively oppose Indra, Agni
<>requested Varun2a to give the following to Arjuna, viz.,
<>the Ga1n2d2i1va bow and a quiver wherein the arrows
<>will never be exhausted, and the chariot marked with
<>the symbol of monkey and drawn by four white horses
<>-all kept by Candra. Varun2a at once made a present
<>of the above to Arjuna. And, it was with the aid of this
<>Ga1n2d2i1va, that Arjuna defeated Indra at the time of
<>Kha1n2d2avada1ha. (See Kha1n2d2avada1ha). Arjuna had
<>taken a secret vow to cut off the head of anyone who
<>asked him to give the bow to some one else. (Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 69).
<NI>In after years Arjuna won many wars with the help of
<>this bow. (See Arjuna).
<NI>5) {%Arjuna gives up Ga1n2d2i1va.%} The great Kuruks2etra war,
<>which shook Bha1rata, to its very foundation came to an
<>end. Dharmaputra was crowned a King. It was at this
<>juncture that the Ya1dava dynasty got itself anni- [Page276-b+ 65]
<>hilated and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a entered maha1sama1dhi. Now the
<>Pa1n2d2avas lost all interest in mundane life, and they
<>set out for the forest on their great journey after crown-
<>ing Pari1ks2it, the grandson of Arjuna as King. Their
<>great travel took them to the shores of the Red Sea.
<>The Ga1n2d2i1va was still in Arjuna's hands. On the shores
<>of the Red Sea Agni Deva appeared before the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas and spoke to them “Well, Pa1n2d2avas, I am Agni
<>Deva. Arjuna requires the Ga1n2d2i1va no more. I got it
<>from Varun2a for Arjuna. Return it, therefore, to
<>Varun2a.”
<NI>No sooner did he hear Agni Deva speak thus than did
<>Arjuna throw it into the depths of the sea and also the
<>quiver which never got exhausted of arrows with it.
<>Agni Deva disappeared, and the Pa1n2d2avas continued
<>their journey. (Maha1prastha1nika Parva, Chapter 1).
<HI>GAN3GA1. The famous and holy river of India.
<NI>1) {%Origin and general information.%} Gan3ga1 had its origin
<>during the incarnation of Vis2n2u as Va1mana. When
<>Va1mana measured the three worlds in three steps the
<>nails on his left feet were raised high. They caused a
<>pore on the upper side of the universe. Gan3ga1, starting
<>from the finger of Vis2n2u's feet fell in heaven (Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<NI>The famous Vis2n2upadi1, the flowing water (ti1rtha) of
<>which washes away the sins of the people in the universe
<>is the very same Gan3ga1 under discussion. For many
<>yugas (eras) this river confined itself to the heights of
<>the sky, otherwise called Vis2n2upada. This particular
<>spot is known as Dhruvaman2d2ala as it is here that
<>Dhruva, son of King Utta1napa1da, does, his penance.
<>The seven sages who constantly go round and round
<>the Dhruvaman2d2ala take their bath in this holy river.
<>The course of the river is thus: starting from Vis2n2upada
<>it falls on devaya1na glittering with crores of vima1nas
<>and therefrom it descends on Candraman2d2ala which it
<>submerges. It follows its course again from there divid-
<>ing itself into four tributaries called Si1ta1, Caks2us,
<>Alakananda1 and Bhadra1 and then falls in Brahmaloka
<>wherefrom it flows in all directions. Of the four tributa-
<>ries Si1ta1 falls on the head of Mount Meru, flows down
<>to Gandhama1dana, then circling through Bhadra1s4va
<>vars2a falls into the eastern sea. Caks2us falls on the
<>peaks of mount Ma1lyava1n, flows through Ketuma1la
<>and falls into the western sea. Alakananda1 falls on
<>mount Hemaku1t2a, flows through Bha1rata Vars2a and falls
<>into the southern sea. And Bhadra1 falls on the head
<>of mount S4r2n3gava1n flows through Uttarakuru and falls
<>into the northern sea. Alakananda1 flows through
<>Bha1rata Vars2a and is regarded as the most sacred of the
<>four tributaries.
<NI>Gan3ga1 which flowed through heaven fell on the earth
<>after thousands of years of its origin. (Bha1gavata,
<>Pan5cama, Skandha, Chapter 17).
<NI>2) {%Why Gan3ga1 became S4iva's consort.%} Maha1vis2n2u was
<>once engaged at Vaikun2t2ha in a pleasant talk with his
<>wives, Laks2mi1, Sarasvati1 and Gan3ga1 when Gan3ga1 cast
<>lustful eyes on Vis2n2u, who, behind the backs of the
<>other two wives returned the lustful glances. Sarasvati1
<>could not put up with that situation for a long time.
<>Therefore, she got up from her seat and beat Gan3ga1.
<>Laks2mi1 tried to restrain Sarasvati1 lest the quarrel should
<>become fiercer. Angered at this intervention Sarasvati1
<>cursed that Laks2mi1 be born on earth. Gan3ga1 got angry
<>that innocent Laks2mi1 was thus cursed, and she in her [Page277-a+ 65]
<>turn cursed that Sarasvati1 be born as a river on earth.
<>Sarasvati1 did not take the curse lying down, but cursed
<>that Gan3ga1 also be born as a river on earth and take
<>upon herself the sins of the whole world. When all the
<>three wives of Vis2n2u got themselves thus into trouble
<>he told them as follows: “Everything has happened as
<>it should have happened. Laks2mi1 may go to the earth
<>and be born in the home of Dharmadhvaja and grow
<>up as his daughter, but not from the womb of his
<>women. There you will purify the three worlds after
<>which you will be born as the plant called tulasi1, and
<>be married by an asura called S4an3khacu1d2a, who will be
<>born as a part of me. And, after that you will be turned
<>into a sacred river called Padma1vati1, and leaving the
<>river on earth your divine form will return to Vaikun2-
<>t2ha.” And, to Gan3ga1 Vis2n2u said as follows: “You will
<>go to earth as a holy river to wash off the sins of people
<>there. A king called Bhagi1ratha will be leading you to
<>earth, and you will, therefore, be known as Bha1gi1rathi1
<>also. And, you remain there on earth as the wife of the
<>ocean of King S4antanu. Your divine form will return
<>to mount Kaila1sa as the consort of S4iva.” As for Sara-
<>svati1, Vis2n2u asked her to be born as a river on earth,
<>her divine form ultimately returning to Satyaloka and
<>then becoming the consort of Brahma1.
<NI>And, thus it was that Laks2mi1 became the consort of
<>Maha1vi1s2n2u, Gan3ga1 of S4iva and Sarasvati1 of Brahma1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, Navama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Gan3ga1 born on earth due to the curse of Brahma1.%} Maha1-
<>bhis2ak, an emperor of the Iks2va1ku dynasty, went
<>to Satyaloka after he had attained heaven, to worship
<>Brahma1. Gan3ga1 too happened to be there. In the
<>devotional atmosphere at Satyaloka a casual breeze
<>removed Gan3ga1's clothes slightly from position, and
<>Maha1bhis2ak then cast a lustful glance at her which she
<>also returned. Brahma1, who was observing this exchange
<>of love got angry and cursed that Maha1bhi1s2ak be born
<>as a King on earth and Gan3ga1 as his wife. Gan3ga1
<>prayed for redemption from the curse, and Brahma1
<>told her that she would regain her old status after she
<>had delivered the As2t2avasus. As the consequence of
<>Brahma1's cure Maha1bhis2ak was born as King S4antanu
<>in the solar dynasty on earth and he married Gan3ga1.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapters 96 and 97).
<NI>4) {%Bhagi1ratha brought down Gan3ga1 on earth.%} King Sagara
<>of the solar dynasty had two wives called Sumati (Vai-
<>darbhi1) and Kes4ini1 (S4aibya1). A son called Asaman5jasa
<>was born to Kes4ini1, and 60,000 princes were born to
<>Sumati. Sagara drove out of the country Asamajn5asaa,
<>who turned out to be an enemy of the people. The
<>60,000 sons of Sagara also proved to be a menace to the
<>world, and the Devas approached Brahma1 for protection
<>from the menace. He assured the Devas that a sage
<>called Kapila will destroy the 60,000 evil fellows.
<NI>During the above period of time Sagara performed an
<>As4vamedha Yajn5a, and his sons went round the earth
<>with the sacrificial horse. But, when they reached the
<>sea-shore the horse disappeared. When the sons comp-
<>lained about it to their father, Sagara, he asked them
<>to look out for the horse in every part of the world and
<>bring it back. Not finding it anywhere on earth they
<>dug a hole and entered Pa1ta1la, where they saw Sage
<>Kapila absorbed in meditation and the missing horse
<>tied to a pole near the sage. (It was Indra who had
<>carried away the horse and tied it there). The sons of [Page277-b+ 64]
<>Sagara, believing that it was Kapila who had stolen
<>the horse were about to attack the sage when he opened
<>his eyes, and they were reduced to ashes in the fire of
<>Kapila's eyes.
<NI>His sons having not returned even after a long time
<>Sagara asked his grandson Am3s4uma1n to seek them out,
<>and after an extensive search he saw Kapila at Pa1ta1la.
<>Am3s4uma1n pleased Kapila with laudatory phrases and
<>the latter returned to him the sacrificial horse. Kapila
<>also pronounced the blessing that the grandson of Am3-
<>s4uma1n would perform the purificatory rites of Sagara's
<>sons by bringing down Gan3ga1 to earth from heaven.
<>Am3s4uma1n returned to the palace with the horse and
<>the as4vamedha was duly concluded.
<NI>From Am3s4uma1n was born Dili1pa and from him Bhagi1-
<>ratha. On becoming King, Bhagi1ratha handed over the
<>reins of government to his ministers and began efforts
<>to bring down Gan3ga1 to earth. He did tapas for thou-
<>sand years on the slopes of the Hima1layas when Gan3ga1
<>asked him to please S4iva first as he alone could face her
<>(Gan3ga1) fall on the earth. Accordingly he pleased S4iva
<>by his penance and S4iva agreed to receive Gan3ga1 on
<>his head. With a terrific noise Gan3ga1 came down on
<>S4iva's head. The haughty Gan3ga1 wanted to carry down
<>S4iva also to Pa1ta1la. Realising this ambition of her
<>S4iva blocked her passage with the result that she wan-
<>dered about in S4iva's matted hair for many years
<>without finding an outlet. Bhagi1ratha again did tapas
<>and pleased S4iva who shook his matted head and made
<>fall some water therefrom on earth. The water fell into
<>Bindusaras, and flowed in seven tributaries, the first
<>three, Hla1dini1, Pa1vani1 and Nalini1 towards the east, the
<>next three, Sucaks2us, Si1ta1 and Sindhu towards the west
<>and the seventh tributary followed Bhagi1ratha. In this
<>manner they progressed a great distance till they reach-
<>ed the a1s4rama of the sage Jahnu, and the haughty
<>Gan3ga1 flooded the a1s4rama. The sage got enraged at
<>this and drank up Gan3ga1. But Bhagi1ratha pleased the
<>sage who then let out Gan3ga1 through his ears. Thence-
<>forth Gan3ga1 came to be called Ja1hnavi1 also. Gan3ga1
<>again followed Bhagi1ratha to Pa1ta1la and made the sons
<>of Sagara attain salvation by purifying them with her
<>waters. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Cantos 43
<>and 44; Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 97; Devi1 Pura1n2a,

<>Parva, Chapter 4 and Vana Parva, Chapter 109).
<NI>5) {%Gan3ga1 flowed into the sea.%} After the purificatory rites
<>of the sons of Sagara were over, Bhagi1ratha conducted
<>Gan3ga1 to the sea and with its waters the sea became
<>full. (Vana Parva, Chapter 109, Verses 18-21).
<NI>6) {%Gan3ga1 set on the thighs of Prati1pa.%} Gan3ga1 once fell
<>in love with Prati1pa, father of S4antanu, and set on his
<>right thigh when he (Prati1pa) was doing penance on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 for a son. Prati1pa did not agree
<>to Gan3ga1's proposal that he should marry her and told
<>her thus: “the right thigh is for the children and
<>daughters-in-law to sit on and the left thigh for the
<>wife; therefore, you be my son's wife.”
<NI>Then Prati1pa called his son S4antanu and told him:
<>“Sometime back a divine woman came to me and I
<>promised to wed her to you. Therefore, if any divine
<>woman approaches you for a son you must accept her,
<>and whatever she may do you must not object to
<>that...”. Not long after this Prati1pa crowned S4antanu [Page278-a+ 65]
<>King and left for the forest, (A1di Parva, Chapter 97).
<NI>7) {%As2t2avasus and Gan3ga1.%} While the wife of Dyau, one
<>of the As2t2avasus (eight Vasus) was roaming about in
<>the forest she saw Nandini1 (the divine cow) grazing
<>with her calf near the a1s4rama of Vasis2t2ha, and she
<>desired to have the cow to be presented to her intimate
<>friend Jitavati1, the daughter of King Us4i1nara. She
<>informed her husband, Dyau about this desire of hers,
<>and Dyau told his relations about it. Next day the
<>As2t2avasus, in the absence of Vasis2t2ha at the a1s4rama,
<>stole off Nandini1 and her calf. When Vasis2t2ha returned
<>to the a1s4rama the cow and calf were missing, and he
<>divined the reason for it with his divine eyes. He cursed
<>that the As2t2avasus be born as men on earth, and when
<>they prayed for redemption from the curse Vasis2t2ha
<>told them that they would be born as men within one
<>year from that day, die at once and return to heaven
<>At the same time the sage said that Dyau alone, who
<>took the leading part in stealing the cow, would live on
<>earth for a longer period before he returned to heaven.
<>(The reputed Bhi1s2ma was this Dyau). The As2t2avasus
<>set out for the earth to be born as men and on their
<>way they met Gan3ga1 and told her about their curse
<>etc. Gan3ga1 also told them about her curse, and permitt-
<>ed them to be born in her womb. (A1di Parva, Chapter
<>99).
<NI>8) {%Gan3ga1 became the wife of S4antanu and the As2t2avasus were
<>born.%} Once while hunting on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>S4antanu saw a beautiful maiden and they fell in love
<>with each other. She agreed to become his wife on the
<>condition that he would not oppose whatever she said.
<>S4antanu agreed to it and married her. Soon after a
<>child was born to them and in the very presence of
<>S4antanu, she threw the child into the Gan3ga1. As per
<>previous condition S4antanu kept mum at this. She
<>threw into the river the seven As2t2avasus, who were
<>born to her in succession. When she was about to
<>throw the last eighth of the As2t2avasus (Dyau) into
<>the river S4antanu prevented her. She got angry at
<>this and disappeared with the child. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 98).
<NI>9) {%S4antanu got back the son.%} Thirtytwo years after,
<>S4antanu went hunting again on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>where he saw the river obstructed in its course with
<>arrows by a handsome boy. S4antanu did not recognise
<>that the boy was his son, who had been named Deva-
<>vrata by Gan3ga1. Devavrata disappeared after throwing
<>S4antanu into an illusion by his magic power. All of a
<>sudden a doubt dawned in his mind whether the boy
<>was his own son, and he called out to Gan3ga1 to show
<>him the boy. Gan3ga1 appeared with her son with beau-
<>tiful ornaments on him and spoke to S4antanu thus:
<>“This is Devavrata, the eighth son whom you entrusted
<>to me. He has mastered everything in archery from
<>Vasis2t2ha, and he is Dyau (the vasu) son of An3gi-

<>greatness of Gan2ga1.--
<NI>If, after death, the bones of the dead are deposited [Page278-b+ 64]
<>in Gan3ga1 the departed will attain heaven. Even if one
<>had sinned throughout his life he would attain Vis2n2u-
<>pa1da (heaven) if he worshipped Gan3ga1. Bathing in the
<>Gan3ga1 is as beneficial as performing hundred yajn5as.
<>As long as the bones of one remain in the waters of the
<>Gan3ga1 so long will he occupy an honourable seat in
<>heaven. He who has come in contact with its water will
<>shine forth as the sun devoid of all darkness. Places
<>which are not favoured by its waters will become barren
<>like night without the moon and trees without flowers.
<>Gan3ga1 water is more than enough to satisfy living
<>things in all the three worlds. He who does penance
<>standing on one leg for thousand years, and he who
<>gives up his body in the waters of the Gan3ga1 are on
<>a par with each other. God attaches more importance
<>to him who has fallen into the Gan3ga1 than to him, who
<>has performed tapas hanging by his head for a thousand
<>years. He who smears the sand on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>on his body will get the lustre and glow of the devas,
<>and he, who smears the sand on his head will shine
<>forth like the Sun. All the sins of those on whom has
<>blown the air which had come in contact with Gan3ga1
<>water will be swept away. It should be known that
<>Gan3ga1 water can wash off all sins and purify mortals.
<>The Agni Pura1n2a (Chapter 110) has the following on
<>this subject.
<NI>Through whatever places the Gan3ga1 flows those places
<>become sublime and sacred. Gan3ga1 is the refuge of all
<>created beings who aspire for the final good. If Gan3ga1
<>is worshipped daily it will save families both on the
<>mother's and the father's side from evil fate. To drink
<>Gan3ga1 water is better than the observance of a thou-
<>sand lunar months. If one worships Gan3ga1 for a month
<>one will derive all the benefits of having performed all
<>the yajn5as. Even the blind (the ignorant) who worship
<>Gan3ga1, will attain equal status with the devas. The
<>sight of Gan3ga1, contact with its waters and drinking
<>Gan3ga1 water will purify people in thousands and lakhs.

<>Suhotra, Suhota1, Gaya, Garbha and Suketu were the

<HI>GARBHA(M). The Pura1n2as have described the views
<>of sages about the origin of a1tman in woman's womb.
<>Asitamaha1muni stated the following about the birth of [Page279-b+ 63]
<>a child to King Janaka. (Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a. Chapter
<NI>48). Of the seven elements in the human body, viz.,
<>Rasa, Rakta (blood), Ma1m3sa (flesh), Medas (fost),
<>Asthi (bone), Majja1 (marrow) and S4ukla (seminal
<>fluid) the last one, S4ukla, is the most valuable. Brahma-
<>bi1ja (the seed for production) is contained in S4ukla.
<>From the food we consume, blood and the seminal fluid
<>take their nutrition. The S4ukla emitted during coitus
<>enters the womb of the woman propelled as it were by
<>Kros2t2ava1yu. It takes only one night for the S4ukla to
<>get inextricably mixed with blood in the womb. In that
<>mixing if the proportion of blood is higher, the child
<>born will be girl, and if the proportion of S4ukla is high-
<>er, the offspring will be boy. If blood and S4ukla are
<>mixed exactly in equal proportions the child will be
<>‘neutral’, neither girl nor boy. During the first month
<>of pregnancy the child will be in liquid form. In the
<>second, it solidifies due to the mixing and interplay of
<>heat, cold, air, etc. During the third, holes for
<>eye, ear, etc. become ready and the vein system is
<>formed. In the fourth, head, hands and legs of the
<>child are formed, and it is during this period that the
<>prospective mother develops certain desires. If those
<>desires are not satisfied the child may be born with
<>physical deformities. During the fifth month the hips
<>and bones develop. The various organs get firmer and
<>stronger gradually and fingers appear during the sixth
<>month. It is during the sixth month that hairs on the
<>head and body appear and feelings and emotions ori-
<>ginate in the mind. During the seventh month the ten
<>va1yus (winds) on the basis of the nervous system are
<>released, and the child experiences glimpses of its pre-
<>vious existence, and ability to feel pain also is there.
<>During the ninth month due to the force of the wind
<>which effects actual delivery the child gets head down
<>in the womb, and during the tenth month it emerges
<>out of the womb. The child loses its memory about the
<>past because of its contact with the female organ
<>and external wind.
<NI>According to the Agni Pura1n2a the process is a little
<>different:
<NI>When Ji1va (the soul) has entered the womb for rebirth
<>it remains in fluid form during the first month. During
<>the second month it solidifies; in the third month the
<>organs begin to develop, in the fourth month skin,
<>flesh and bones appear, in the fifth month hairs appear,
<>in the sixth month mind is produced, in the seventh
<>month the child will begin to feel pain. The body is
<>covered by a skin (Garbhacarma) and both hands are
<>held above the head in saluting position. If the child
<>is a female it lies in the left side of the mother's womb,
<>if a male on the right and if ‘neutral’ in the middle of
<>it. From the seventh month the child begins to experi-
<>ence the taste of foods consumed by the mother. During
<>the eighth and ninth month there would be great
<>emotional excitements and upsurges. If the mother
<>suffered from chronic diseases the child also would in-
<>herit it. When pregnancy is matured thus, certain
<>winds lead the child down the womb and it gets out
<>through the female organ.
<NI>The child inherits its skin, flesh and heart from the
<>mother. The sex organ, marrow, excretion, sweet and
<>belly are inherited from the father. Head, the nervous [Page280-a+ 64]
<>system and s4ukla are the contributions of the a1tman.

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus:--Brahma1
<>-Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Garud2a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Kas4yapa, grandson of Brahma1 and son of
<>Mari1ci married the eight daughters of Daks2a called
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1. And to Ta1mra1 five daughters were born,
<>viz. Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. Out
<>of the five women Kraun5ci1 became mother of the owls,
<>Bha1si1 delivered the bha1sas (types of birds) and from
<>S4yeni1 were born vultures and kites. Ham3sa, Kalaham3sa,
<>Koka etc. are children of Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1. From S4uki1 was
<>born Nala1 and from Nala1, Vinata1; Arun2a and Garud2a
<>were the two sons born to Vinata1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 15).
<NI>There is a story in the Maha1bha1rata about the birth of
<>Arun2a and Garud2a. Kas4yapa who was much pleased
<>with the service of Vinata1 and Kadru1 asked them to
<>select any boon they desired. Kadru1 chose to have a
<>thousand na1gas as her children while Vinata1 chose to
<>have two sons more powerful and heroic than the thou-
<>sand sons of Kadru1. After granting them the boon
<>Kas4yapa retreated into the forest.
<NI>After some time Kadru1 laid thousand eggs and Vinata1
<>two eggs. Both of them kept their eggs in hot pots. In
<>the 500th year the eggs of Kadru1 hatched and thousand
<>serpents of various kinds emerged out of them. But
<>Vinata1's eggs did not hatch yet, and the sight of Kadru1
<>playing with her children pained Vinata1 much. She,
<>therefore, broke open one of her eggs in secret, and a
<>half-grown child stepped out of it. That child was
<>Arun2a. Arun2a got angry that Vinata1 forced open the
<>egg prematurely. He told her that as punishment there-
<>of she would become a slave of Kadru1. But, Arun2a
<>granted her redemption from the curse thus: After an-
<>other 500 years the remaining egg of yours will hatch
<>and a son endowed with exceptional power and pro-
<>wess will be born to you. He will liberate you from
<>slavery.” After telling his mother so much Arun2a rose
<>to the sky where he became the charioteer of the Sun.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 16. See also Para 6 infra).
<NI>After 500 years the egg broke itself open and out came
<>Garud2a with blazing effulgence, and he rose up in the
<>sky. His body glowed like the sun. The Devas who got
<>themselves dimmed by his effulgence asked Agnideva
<>the reason therefor. Agnideva told them about the
<>birth of Garud2a and also that he was equally effulgent
<>as himself (Agnideva). Then all of them went to
<>Garud2a and lavished on his head all possible blessings,
<>and Garud2a, as requested by them, controlled his efful-
<>gence and returned to his mother. (A1di Parva, Chap-
<>ter 23).
<NI>3) {%Slavery of Vinata1:%} The churning of the Milk-ocean
<>was done before Garud2a was born. Indra got a horse
<>named Uccaih2s4ravas from the Ocean of Milk. Between
<>Kadru1 and Vinata1 a dispute arose as regards the colour
<>of the horse's tail, Kadru1 saying that it was black while
<>Vinata1 asserted that it was white. They further agreed
<>to test the colour the next day, betting that she who
<>was proved to be wrong would become the slave of the
<>victor. As the na1ga sons of Kadru1 hung on to the tail [Page281-b+ 64]
<>of the horse the tail appeared to be black and Vinata1
<>lost the bet and became Kadru1's slave.
<NI>It was at this juncture that Garud2a was born, and he
<>felt highly mortified to find his mother working as a
<>slave of Kadru1.
<NI>Kadru1 and her na1ga sons once ordered Vinata1 to carry
<>them to the na1ga residence in the middle of the ocean,
<>called Ra1man2i1yaka (Raman2am). Accordingly Vinata1
<>carrying Kadru1 on her shoulders and Garud2a carrying
<>Kadru1's sons on his shoulders rose up in the sky. But,
<>Garud2a did not relish the slavish work, and he, carry-
<>ing with him the na1gas, flew up to the sun's orbit. The
<>na1ga children fainted due to the excessive heat. But, on
<>the request of Kadru1 Indra sent heavy rain and the
<>na1gas regained consciousness. By then they had reached
<>Ra1man2i1yaka island.
<NI>4) {%Attempt at freeing Vinata1 from thraldom.%} Garud2a, ex-
<>tremely pained at the pitiable plight of his mother, one
<>day asked Kadru1 what price she and her children
<>demanded for freeing Vinata1 from slavery, and Kadru1
<>demanded Amr2ta from Devaloka as the price.
<>Garud2a decided to get it and informed his mother
<>about his decision to fly to Devaloka. But, what about
<>food till he reached Devaloka? Vinata1 solved the pro-
<>blem by advising Garud2a to eat the nis2a1das he will
<>meet on his way to Devaloka at the island called
<>Nis2a1da1laya, at the same time specially forbidding him
<>from eating on any account, brahmins who might be
<>there, at Nis2a1da1laya. How to distinguish brahmins
<>from others, queried Garud2a, and his mother replied
<>by pointing out that the brahmin will burn the throat
<>of him who tries to eat him, like fire. Then Vinata1
<>blessed her son that his wings would be protected by
<>Va1yu, the lower half of his body by sun and moon, the
<>rest of the body by the Vasus and the head by Agni.
<>She also promised to wait there till her son returned.
<NI>5) {%Garud2a to Devaloka.%} After saluting his mother
<>Garud2a set out on his quest for Amr2ta. All the fourteen
<>worlds shook at the lashing of his wings. He reached
<>Nis2a1da1laya, where while consuming whole lots of Nis2a1-
<>das a brahmin and his wife also happened to get into
<>his throat. Garud2a felt their presence immediately in
<>his throat and requested them to get out of his mouth.
<>Accordingly they got out and also blessed Garud2a, who
<>continued on his journey.
<NI>Next Garud2a reached the forest where his father
<>Kas4yapa was engaged in tapas. He told him about his
<>mission and requested him for something to eat.
<>Kas4yapa replied thus:--“You see a pool wherein an
<>elephant and a tortoise are living for long as enemies.
<>Long ago two brothers Vibha1vasu and Suprati1ka quar-
<>relled over their paternal wealth and at the height of
<>it Vibha1vasu cursed Suprati1ka to become an elephant
<>when Suprati1ka pronounced the counter curse that
<>Vibha1vasu should turn out to be a tortoise. You, my
<>son Garud2a may eat that elephant and tortoise. May
<>your journey for Amr2ta be crowned with success.
<NI>Now, Garud2a after saluting his father, flew up in the
<>sky carrying in his beak the elephant and the tortoise
<>from the pool. As trees were falling uprooted due to
<>the terrific vibrations caused by the lashing of his wings
<>Garud2a did not find a convenient place to sit down to
<>eat his food. While continuing the journey Garud2a saw
<>a big tree, its branches spread out in a circumference [Page282-a+ 65]
<>of a hundred yojanas. But, as soon as Garud2a set foot on
<>a branch of the tree it (branch) crumbled down. On
<>that broken branch were the sages called Ba1lakhilyas
<>doing tapas hanging their heads down. Fearing that the
<>sages might fall down Garud2a continued his flight
<>holding in his beak the torn branch of the tree. But he
<>could not find a safe place to deposit the branch with
<>the sages. So he came again to Mount Gandhama1dana
<>and saw Kas4yapa, who apologised to the Ba1lakhilyas
<>on behalf of his son and also explained to them about
<>his mission. The Ba1lakhilyas were pleased and they left
<>the place for the Hima1layas. As advised by Kas4yapa
<>Garud2a deposited the branch of the tree on an unin-
<>habited mountain peak. Garud2a ate the elephant and
<>the tortoise there, and therefrom flew to Devaloka (A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 29, 30).
<NI>6) {%Ba1lakhilyas cursed Indra.%} Even before the arrival of
<>Garud2a ill omens began appearing in Devaloka. Indra
<>asked Br2haspati for explanation about the ill omens.
<>Br2haspati with his divine eyes saw Garud2a approach-
<>ing Devaloka for Amr2ta, and he told Indra about
<>Garud2a born out of the powers of the tapas of Kas4yapa
<>and the Ba1lakhilyas. He also told that such a fate as
<>the present one befell Indra due to a curse of the
<>Ba1lakhilyas. Indra and the other Devas stood guard
<>over the pot of Amr2ta ready to repel all possible
<>attacks.
<NI>There was a reason for Garud2a's birth from the powers
<>of the tapas of the Ba1lakhilyas, and also for Indra to
<>be put into the present predicament due to the curse
<>of the Ba1lakhilyas. Kas4yapapraja1pati, a long time ago,
<>began a terrific yajn5a for a son, and Indra and the
<>Ba1lakhilyas who numbered more than 60,000 were
<>deputed by Kas4yapa to collect firewood for the yajn5a.
<>The Ba1lakhilyas were only of the size of a thumb, and
<>Indra who very easily collected all the firewood needed
<>for the yajn5a laughed at the tiny Ba1lakhilyas who were
<>carrying small twigs etc. for firewood. Angered at the
<>insult the Ba1lakhilyas removed themselves to another
<>place nearby and began a yajn5a directed against Indra
<>who alarmed at it sought the help of Kas4yapa who then
<>held peace talks with the Ba1lakhilyas. They transferred
<>their ya1gas4akti (ya1jn5ic powers) also to Kas4yapa and
<>agreed to be satisfied with the condition that as the
<>result of Kas4yapa's yajn5a a son should be born to him,
<>who (the son) would defeat Indra. Thus, for the time
<>being Indra escaped from the wrath of the Ba1lakhilyas.
<>After the yajn5a was over Vinata1 came to Kas4yapa and
<>he blessed her with a son wishing that he should be-
<>come exceptionally strong and powerful, and that was
<>Garud2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 30).
<NI>7) {%Amr2takalas4a1paharan2am. (The pot of nectar carried
<>away).%} Garud2a approached the pot of nectar, and
<>Vis4vakarma1 who attacked him first was felled to the
<>ground. The dust storm raised by the waving of
<>Garud2a's wings blinded everybody. The Devas and
<>Indra, nay, even the sun and the Moon lined up
<>against Garud2a, but he defeated them all, and entered
<>the particular place where the pot of nectar was kept.
<>Two terrific wheels were rotating round the pot and
<>they would cut into mince-meat anybody who tried to
<>lay hands on the pot and a machine circled the wheels.
<>Below the wheels were two monstrous serpents with
<>glowing eyes and protruding tongues like flashes of
<>fire, and the serpents never closed their eyes. The very [Page282-b+ 65]
<>look with those eyes was enough to poison anyone to
<>death. Garud2a blinded those eyes by raising a torrent
<>of dust, pierced them in the middle with his beak and
<>and through the hole, his body reduced to such a tiny
<>shape, went nearer to the pot. He destroyed the
<>wheels and the machine, and carrying the pot of nectar
<>in his beaks rose to the sky shielding the light of the
<>sun by his outspread wings. Maha1vis2n2u, who became so
<>much pleased with the tremendous achievements of
<>Garud2a asked him to choose any boon. Garud2a
<>requested Vis2n2u that he should be made his (Vis2n2u's)
<>vehicle and rendered immortal without his tasting
<>amr2ta. Both the boons were granted.
<NI>8) {%Garud2a and Indra became friends.%} Indra hit with the
<>Vajra (his special weapon) the wings of Garud2a who
<>was returning from Vis2n2u. It did not wound his body,
<>but a feather of his fell in the atmosphere. Everybody
<>who saw the feather acclaimed Garud2a as Suparn2a (he
<>with the good wings). Indra was wonder-struck, and
<>he approached Garud2a and requested that they should
<>be friends in future and the pot of nectar be returned.
<>Garud2a replied that the nectar would be returned if
<>he was granted the power to make na1gas his food, and
<>Indra blessed him that he would live by consuming
<>na1gas. And then Garud2a told Indra thus: “I took this
<>pot of amr2ta not for my own use. The na1gas cheated
<>my mother and made her a slave, and she will be freed
<>if only this pot of nectar is given to them (na1gas). You
<>may snatch off the pot from the na1gas; I shall not
<>object to it.”
<NI>Indra and Garud2a thus became friends and the former
<>followed Garud2a on his way back home.
<NI>9) {%Garud2a handed over the pot of amr2ta to the na1gas and
<>Indra cheated them of it.%} Garud2a handed over the pot of
<>nectar to the na1gas, who on the suggestion of the
<>former placed the pot on darbha grass spread on the
<>ground. Also, in accordance with Garud2a's advice that
<>they should take a purificatory bath before tasting the
<>amr2ta the na1gas went out to have the bath, and in
<>their absence Indra carried off the pot of nectar back
<>to Devaloka. Failing to find the pot of nectar on their
<>return from bath the aggrieved na1gas licked the darbha
<>on which the pot was placed with the result that their
<>tongues were cloven into two. It was from that day
<>onwards that the na1gas became double-tongued
<>(dvijihvas). And, thus Garud2a redeemed his mother
<>from slavery. (A1di Parva, Chapter 34).
<NI>10) {%The fig tree which Garud2a broke with his beaks and
<>Lan3ka1.%} It has been noted above that Garud2a on his
<>way to Devaloka rested on a fig tree. That fig is
<>called Subhadra in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>Ra1van2a saw the fig tree around which sages were sitting
<>and which bore marks made by Garud2a sitting thereon.
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Canto 35, Verse
<>26).
<NI>There is some connection between this tree and Lan3ka1.
<>Garud2a had, as directed by Kas4yapa, deposited in the
<>sea the branch of the tree on which the Ba1lakhilyas
<>hung in tapas and with which Garud2a flew hither and
<>thither fearing about the safety of the Ba1lakhilyas. At
<>the spot in the sea where the branch was deposited
<>sprang up an island like the peak of a mountain. It
<>was this island which in after years became reputed as
<>Lan3ka1. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1mukhalam3baka,
<>Taran3ga 4). [Page283-a+ 65]
<NI>11) {%Garud2a, Saubhari and Ka1liya.%} Garud2a had always
<>entertained great hatred against the na1gas, and now
<>Indra's permission having been obtained by him to eat
<>the na1gas for food, Garud2a decided to launch a regular
<>na1ga-hunting expedition. He began eating the na1gas
<>one by one. Alarmed at this the na1gas planned for their
<>security in a conclave, and approached Garud2a with
<>the proposal that one na1ga would go to him daily
<>to serve as his food instead of his indiscriminate killing
<>of them. Garud2a accepted their proposal. After some
<>time the na1gas proposed to Garud2a that they would
<>conduct a sarpa-bali (sacrifice of serpents) and submit
<>the food got out of the bali to him so that his na1ga-
<>hunting might be stopped for ever. Garud2a agreed to
<>this also. According to the new agreement daily one
<>na1ga began going to Garud2a with the food got
<>out of the bali.
<NI>But Ka1liya alone did not agree to the programme as he
<>did not recognise Garud2a to be superior to him in
<>power. And, Garud2a, who wanted to teach the haughty
<>Ka1liya a lesson challenged him to fight, and the fight
<>took place in river Ka1lindi1, Ka1liya's abode. During
<>the fight the lashing of Garud2a's wings raised the
<>water in Ka1lindi1 up in the sky and it drenched the
<>sage Saubhari all over, who was performing tapas on
<>the banks of Ka1lindi1. Saubhari cursed that the body
<>of Garud2a be shattered into a thousand pieces if ever
<>he entered that area in future, and thenceforth the
<>place became a prohibited area for Garud2a. During
<>after years Ka1liya was put up at this place.
<NI>A kadamba tree alone outlived the eflect of the poison
<>of Ka1liya. The tree could outlive the deadly poison
<>because Garud2a had rested on it on his way back from
<>Devaloka with amr2ta. (Bha1gavata das4ama S4kandha).
<NI>12) {%Relationship of Garud2a with the kings of the solar
<>dynasty.%} King Sagara of the solar dynasty was married
<>to Sumati, the elder sister of Garud2a, and there is a
<>story behind the marriage.
<NI>There was once a king called Suba1hu in the solar
<>dynasty. He married one Ya1davi1, but for many years
<>they had no issues. Ya1davi1 had become old by the
<>time she conceived a child as the result of many
<>yajn5as etc. But, Suba1hu's other wives, viz. co-wives
<>of Ya1davi1, did not like the prospects of Ya1davi1
<>becoming a mother. They administered poison to her
<>with the result that Ya1davi1 did not deliver in time,
<>but continued as a pregnant woman for seven years.
<>The sad couple, for their mental relief went into the
<>forest and lived as disciples of a sage called Aurva. But
<>Suba1hu died rather soon and Ya1davi1 prepared
<>herself to follow him in the funeral pyre. But, the
<>sage Aurva prevented her from self immolation speak-
<>ing to her thus: “You shall not act rashly. The child
<>in your womb will become a famous emperor and rule
<>over the whole world.”
<NI>Ya1davi1 yielded to the sage's advice and did not court
<>death, and soon afterwards she delivered a son, and he
<>was named Sagara, which meant “he who was affected
<>by poison even while he was in the mother's womb. It
<>was this child who, in later years, became reputed as
<>emperor Sagara.
<NI>Sagara married the elder sister of Garud2a when he was
<>living as a boy in Aurva's a1s4rama, and there is a story
<>behind the marriage, a story which related to the time
<>when Garud2a was not born. [Page283-b+ 65]
<NI>Vinata1, mother of Garud2a, while she was working as the
<>slave of Kadru1, one day went into the woods to collect
<>firewood for her mistress. In the terrible rain and
<>storm that ensued, Vinata1 lost her track and wandered
<>in the forest for many days before she could take shelter
<>in the a1s4rama of a Sannya1sin. The pious man felt sorry
<>for poor Vinata1 and blessed her that a son, who would
<>be able to win freedom for her would be born to her.
<>Garud2a was the son thus born to her.
<NI>Before the birth of Garud2a when Kas4yapa and Vinata1
<>were living together with their daughter Sumati the boy
<>sage Upamanyu, son of Sutapas, went to them and told
<>Kas4yapa thus: “While touring round the earth I wor-
<>shipped the pitr2s at Gaya1 and I have been told that they
<>(Pitr2s) would get redemption only in case I married and
<>became a father. I, therefore, request you to please give
<>your daughter Sumati to me as wife. Vinata1 did not
<>relish this proposal. Upamanyu got angry at the re-
<>jection of his offer and cursed Vinata1 saying that if
<>Sumati was given in marriage to any other brahmin boy
<>she (Vinata1) would die with her head broken into
<>pieces.
<NI>It was during this period when Vinata1 was in a fix
<>about the marriage of Sumati that Garud2a was born to
<>her. He also thought over the problem and argued like
<>this: the curse is only against a brahmin boy marrying
<>my sister Sumati; why not Sumati be given in marriage
<>to a Ks2atriya; but where to find an eligible Ks2atriya
<>boy? At this stage Vinata1 asked him to go and meet the
<>Sannya1sin, who had promised her an illustrious son, in
<>the forest and this Sannya1sin directed Garud2a to Aurva,
<>for advice and guidance. When Garud2a met Aurva and
<>sought his advice about the marriage of his sister, the
<>sage thought that the context offered a very good bride
<>to Sagara. And, according to Aurva's advice Sumati
<>was married to Sagara, and thus Garud2a became re-
<>lated to the Kings of the Solar dynasty. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, Chapters 16, 17 and 18). The Sixty thousand
<>sons born to Sagara by Sumati were reduced to ashes in
<>the fire which emanated from the eyes of Kapila. (See
<>Kapila). When Am3s4uma1n, the grandson of Sagara was
<>going around the world to find out these 60,000 sons he
<>met Garud2a on the way, and it was he who advised that
<>the waters of Gan3ga1 should be brought down on earth
<>so that the dead sons of Sagara might get spiritual
<>redemption. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Chap-
<>ter 41).
<NI>13) {%Garud2a's conceit laid low.%} A very beautiful daughter,
<>Gun2akes4i1, was born to Ma1tali, the charioteer of Indra.
<>In the course of his search for a suitable husband for
<>Gun2akes4i1 he came to Pa1ta1laloka in the company of
<>Na1rada, and there Ma1tali selected a noble na1ga called
<>Sumukha as his prospective son-in-law. But a month
<>before Garud2a had eaten Sumukha's father Cikara, and
<>he had also given notice to Sumukha that within a
<>month's time he too would be eaten.
<NI>Na1rada and Ma1tali met Sumukha at the abode of his
<>grandfather A1ryaka, who was very glad to marry his
<>grandson to Ma1tali's daughter. But, the threat of
<>Garud2a that he would eat Sumukha before the month
<>was over stared them all cruelly in their face. So, they
<>appealed to Indra for a solution to the problem, in the
<>presence of Maha1vis2n2u. Indra gave an extension of life
<>to Sumukha and he wedded Gun2akes4i1. The marriage
<>enraged Garud2a so much that he went to Indra's [Page284-a+ 64]
<>assembly and insulted both Indra and Vis2n2u at which
<>Vis2n2u extended his right hand to Garud2a asking him
<>whether he could hold the hand. And, when Garud2a
<>placed Vis2n2u's hand on his head he felt as if the whole
<>weight of the three worlds was put on the head. Garud2a
<>admitted his defeat. Maha1vis2n2u thus laid low the
<>conceit of Garud2a. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 105).
<NI>14) {%Garud2a helped Ga1lava.%} Ga1lava was a disciple of
<>Vis4va1mitra. Once Dharmadeva, to test Vis4va1mitra, went
<>to his a1s4rama disguised as Vasis2t2ha and asked for food.
<>As there was no ready-made food at the a1s4rama just
<>then, Vis4va1mitra naturally took some time to cook new
<>food, and he went with it, steaming hot, in a plate to
<>the guest. Saying that he would return within minutes
<>and receive the food, the guest (Dharmadeva) left the
<>place, and Vis4va1mitra stood there with the plate in
<>hand awaiting the return of the guest. He had to
<>remain standing thus for one hundred years, and during
<>this whole period it was Ga1lava who stood there looking
<>after his guru. When hundred years were completed
<>Dharmadeva returned to Vis4va1mitra and accepted his
<>hospitality, and then only could the latter take some
<>rest.
<NI>Vis4va1mitra blessed Ga1lava, and now it was time for him
<>to leave the a1s4rama. Though Vis4va1mitra told that no
<>gurudaks2in2a1 (tuition fee) was required Ga1lava persist-
<>ed in asking him what fee or present he wanted.
<>Vis4va1mitra lost his temper and told Ga1lava that if he
<>was so very particular about gurudaks2in2a1, eight hun-
<>dred horses all having the colour of moon, and one ear
<>black in colour might be given as daks2in2a1. Ga1lava
<>stood there aghast at the above pronouncement of his
<>preceptor, when Garud2a happened to go over there and
<>hear from Ga1lava about his sad plight. Money was re-
<>quired to purchase horses, but Ga1lava was penniless.
<>At any rate Garud2a with Ga1lava on his back flew east-
<>wards and reached R2s2abhaparvata and they rested on
<>a peak of it. There the Brahma1 woman, S4a1n2d2ili1 was
<>engaged in tapas and she served them with food. After
<>food Garud2a spoke disparagingly about S4a1n2d2ili1. Garud2a
<>and Ga1lava slept that night on the floor, but when they
<>woke up in the morning lo! Garud2a was completely
<>shed of his feathers. Garud2a stood before S4a1n2d2ili1, his
<>head bent in anguish. S4a1n2d2ili1 blessed Garud2a, who
<>then got back his old feathers.
<NI>Continuing their journey Garud2a and Ga1lava reached
<>the palace of the very rich King, Yaya1ti. Garud2a intro-
<>duced Ga1lava to Yaya1ti, who found it difficult to get
<>800 horses for Ga1lava. But, Yaya1ti gave his daughter
<>Ma1dhavi1 to Ga1lava saying that he might give her to
<>any King and get money enough to purchase 800
<>horses. After thus showing the means to get money to
<>Ga1lava, Garud2a returned home.
<NI>Ga1lava gave Ma1dhavi1 first to King Haryas4va of
<>Ayodhya1, then to King Divoda1sa of Ka1s4i1 and next to
<>King Us4i1nara of Bhoja and got from them two hundred
<>horses each, and he submitted the horses and also
<>Ma1dhavi1 in lieu of the balance of two hundred horses
<>to Vis4va1mitra as daks2in2a1. A son called As2t2aka was born

<>went to Devaloka and plucked the Pa1rija1ta flower from

<NI>16) {%Defeated by Va1suki.%} To churn the Milk-Ocean the
<>Devas and Asuras decided to use Mount Mandara as
<>the shaft and Va1suki as the rope to rotate the shaft.
<>The attempts of the Devas, the Asuras and the Bhu1taga-
<>n2as of S4iva failed to uproot and bring with them the
<>mountain, when Garud2a, at the instance of Vis2n2u
<>brought the mountain as easily as a kite carries a frog.
<>Again, when others failed to bring Va1suki from na1ga-
<>loka Garud2a went and asked the na1ga chief to follow
<>him to the ocean of Milk. Va1suki replied that if his
<>presence was so indispensable he must be carried over
<>there. Then Garud2a caught the middle part of Va1suki
<>in his beak and rose in the air. But, even though
<>Garud2a rose beyond the horizon, when he looked down
<>half of Va1suki still remained on the ground. Garud2a
<>then tried to fold Va1suki into two and carry it, but,
<>again to no purpose. Disappointed and humiliated
<>Garud2a returned without Va1suki. Afterwards Va1suki
<>was brought to the ocean of Milk by S4iva's hand stret-
<>ched down into Pa1ta1la. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha

<>the vibration caused by the lashing of Garud2a's wings
<>Kalha1ra flowers from the garden of Kubera were flown
<>to the feet of Pa1n5ca1li1. She wore the fragrant flowers in
<>her hair saying that if she were to have good flowers,
<>wind had to bring them. Since there was a mild and
<>veiled insinuation in that statement that Bhi1ma was
<>inferior to the wind the former did not appreciate that
<>comment by Pa1n5ca1li1. And so he rushed to Mount
<>Gandhama1dana to collect Kalha1ra flowers. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 106).

<>started between the Devas and the brahmins, the former
<>advocating the use of goat's flesh in performing yajn5as
<>while the brahmins contended that grains were sufficient
<>for the purpose. Uparicaravasu, who arbitrated in the
<>debate spoke in favour of the Devas, which the brahmins
<>did not like, and they cursed Vasu to fall from the sky
<>into the pits of the earth. This curse was countered
<>by the Devas blessing him that as long as Uparicara-
<>vasu remained on earth he would not feel hungry and
<>that he would regain his old form due to the blessings
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Vasu prayed to Vis2n2u, who sent Garud2a
<>to the former, and Garud2a carried Vasu to the sky on
<>his wings. Thus Vasu became again Uparicaravasu.

<HI>GAUTAMA 1
<NI>1) {%General Information.%} The Pura1n2as record about a
<>sage called Gautama though nothing is known about
<>his genealogy. Yet the genealogy of his wife Ahalya1 is
<>available. See under ‘Ahalya1’.
<NI>2) {%Sons of Gautama.%} The eldest son of Gautama was
<>S4ata1nanda. (S4loka 2, Sarga, 51, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a). Gautama had two sons. S4aradva1n and
<>Ciraka1ri1. S4aradva1n was born with arrows in his hand.
<>(S4loka 2, Chapter 130, A1di Parva). Ciraka1ri1 used to
<>ponder over everything before he acted and so all his
<>actions were delayed. He got his name Ciraka1ri1.
<>(Chapter 266, Sabha1 Parva). S4aradva1n was known as
<>Gautama also. That was why Kr2pa and Kr2pi1, children
<>of S4aradva1n were known as Gautama and Gautami1.
<>(S4loka 2, Chapter 129, A1di Parva). Besides these,
<>Gautama had a daughter of unknown name. There is
<>a reference to this girl in s4loka 11 of Chapter 56 of
<>As4vamedha Parva. It is reported that this daughter
<>wept when Utan3ga a disciple of Gautama came to the
<>a1s4rama with a huge load of firewood on his head. In
<>Chapter 4, of Va1mana Pura1n2a there is a reference to a
<>few other daughters of Gautama, namely, Jaya1, Jayanti1
<>and Apara1ji1.
<NI>3) {%An attempt to kill Ahalya1.%} Once when Gautama was
<>away from the a1s4rama Indra came there as a guest.
<>Considering it as her duty to treat a guest of her
<>husband properly during his absence Ahalya1 received
<>him well and gave him fruit to ease his tiredness.
<>Indra went back. Gautama on knowing this on his
<>return suspected the chastity of his wife and calling
<>his son Ciraka1ri1 to his side asked him to cut off her
<>head. After giving the order Gautama went to the
<>forests.
<NI>Ciraka1ri1 had a peculiar nature. He will ponder over
<>things deeply before taking any action. He knew he must
<>obey the orders of his father but killing one's own
<>mother was a greater sin than disobeying a father.
<>Weighing the merits and demerits of the act Ciraka1ri1
<>sat thinking without doing anything.
<NI>Gautama when he reached the forest thought again
<>about Ahalya1 and her crime. After all what has she
<>done? A guest came to the a1s4rama and as duty bound
<>she welcomed him. It was indeed a great sin to have
<>killed her by her own son. Immersed in thoughts of
<>this kind, sad and repentant, Gautama returned to the
<>a1s4rama to find Ciraka1ri1 sitting silently deeply engross-
<>ed in thoughts. On seeing his father Ciraka1ri1 was
<>perplexed and he explained to his father about the good [Page286-a+ 64]
<>and bad effects of his order. Gautama was pleased at
<>this and he blessed him with long life.
<NI>4) {%How the disciple Utan3ga was tested.%} Utan3ga was the
<>best of the disciples of Gautama. So even when all
<>the other disciples were sent away Gautama asked
<>Utan3ga to continue as a disciple which Utan3ga did
<>most willingly. The disciple became old with grey
<>hairs. Then taking pity on him Gautama received
<>gurudaks2in2a1 from Utan3ga and sent him away with
<>blessings. (For details see under ‘Utan3ga’).
<NI>5) {%Curse of Ahalya1.%} Indra became a lover of Ahalya1
<>and slept with her. Gautama coming to know of that
<>cursed both Indra and Ahalya1. (For details see under
<>Ahalya1).
<NI>6) {%Other details regarding Gautama.%}
<NI>(i) Kalma1s2apa1da, King of Ayodhya1. lived for twelve
<>years as a demon following a curse of Vasis2t2ha. At

<>ravas broke out Gautama went to the Kuruks2etra
<>battlefield and advised Dron2a to stop the battle.
<>(S4loka 36, Chapter 190, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(viii) Gautama was also one of the many sages who
<>visited Bhi1s2ma while he was lying on his bed of
<>arrows.
<NI>(ix) Once Gautama built a hermitage on the top of
<>the mountain Pa1riya1tra and did penance there for
<>sixtythousand years. Ka1la, the God of time, then appear-
<>ed before him and Gautama received him well and
<>sent him away. (S4loka 10, Chapter 47, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>x) Once Gautama turned the moustache of Indra
<>green by a curse for showing disrespect to him. (S4loka
<>23, Chapter 352, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(xi) When Gautama was born, there was such bri-
<>lliance that the surrounding darkness was removed and
<>so the boy was named Gautama (Gau=light rays,
<>Tamas=darkness) to mean the remover of darkness.
<>(S4loka 94, Chapter 93, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(xii) Once Gautama instructed the King Vr2s2a1darbhi

<>Kaks2iva1n. (S4lokas 17, 18 and 3 of Chapters 4, 7 and
<>21 respectively of Sabha1 Parva, M.B.).
<HI>GAUTAMA III. An ascetic of great erudition. He had
<>three sons named Ekata, Dvita and Trita. (See under
<>‘Ekata’). (S4loka 79, Chapter 36, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA IV. Another ascetic of great virtue. Once
<>when this Gautama was going through the forest he
<>saw an elephant babe lying wearied. He took it to his
<>a1s4rama and brought it up. When it became a full
<>grown elephant Indra disguised as the emperor
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came to take it away secretly. Gautama
<>found it out and then he was offered thousand cows
<>and much wealth in lieu of the elephant. But Gautama
<>refused to part with the elephant. Pleased with his
<>extreme affection for his dependant, Indra took both
<>Gautama and the elephant to heaven. (Chapter 102,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>GAUTAMA. V. An ungrateful brahmin. He was born
<>in Madhyades4a. He left his parents and after travelling
<>in many lands he came to a country of foresters. The
<>foresters received him with respect and he lived in a
<>hut of the foresters and married a lady from among
<>them.
<NI>Gautama abandoned his brahminhood and accepted
<>the duties of foresters. He was living like this when
<>another brahmin boy came to that village. He searched
<>in vain for a brahmin house to stay for the night and
<>then knowing that a man born a brahmin but made
<>a forester by his duties was living there he went to his
<>house. Gautama also came there carrying the animals
<>and birds he had hunted down that day. His body
<>was bathed in blood. The brahmin guest felt com-
<>passion for Gautama and advised him to leave his
<>trade and go to his house in his country.
<NI>In the morning the brahmin guest went away without
<>taking any food. The advice of his guest kept him
<>thinking. He decided to abandon his life as a hunter
<>and so leaving everything behind he went to the sea-
<>shore. He met some merchants on the way and while
<>they were travelling together a wild elephant attacked
<>them. Many were killed and Gautama escaping ran
<>swiftly and came to the base of a big banyan tree.
<>He was tired and slept there for a while.
<NI>A big vulture named Na1d2i1jam3gha lived on the top of
<>that banyan tree. He used to go out to worship Brahma1
<>at dusk and when he returned to his abode that day
<>he saw a man lying wearied down below. Gautama
<>attempted to catch the vulture and eat it but the
<>vulture playing a benign host placed before Gautama
<>food for him and made enquiries about him and asked
<>him the purpose of his travels. Gautama told him that
<>he was very poor and that he wanted to acquire some
<>wealth somehow.
<NI>Na1d2i1jam3gha then said that he would get for him enough
<>wealth from the demon-King Viru1pa1ks2a who was an
<>intimate friend of his. Gautama was pleased. The
<>vulture fanned him and sent him to sleep. Next morn-
<>ing Na1d2i1jam3gha sent Gautama to Viru1pa1ks2a and the
<>demon gave Gautama as much gold as he could carry
<>on his shoulders.
<NI>Gautama took the gold as a head load and came back
<>to the base of the banyan tree. Na1d2i1jam3gha came to him
<>and they talked to each other for some time. Gautama
<>who had become a gluttonous flesh eater looked with
<>greed at the fat body of the vulture and in an instant [Page287-a+ 64]
<>killed it and packed the flesh along with the load of
<>gold and went his way.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a did not see Na1d2i1jam3gha for two days and he
<>was worried. He, therefore, sent his son to the banyan
<>tree to look for Na1d2i1jam3gha. When he reached the
<>base of the tree he found to his grief only the bones
<>and feathers of his father's friend. He knew what had
<>happened and he immediately followed the ungrateful
<>brahmin and capturing him brought him to his father
<>bound hand and foot. Viru1pa1ks2a without any mercy
<>cut him into pieces and threw them for the crows to
<>eat. But even the crows would not eat the flesh of such
<>an ungrateful man.
<NI>Viru1pa1ks2a burnt the remains of Na1d2i1jam3gha in a
<>funeral pyre. Devas assembled in the skies to watch
<>the funeral. Then Surabhi sprinkled milk on the
<>funeral pyre and brought back Na1d2i1jam3gha to life.
<>The reborn vulture felt sorry for Gautama and request-
<>ed Surabhi to restore to life the wretched Gautama
<>also. Gautama also was brought back to life and he
<>embraced Na1d2i1jam3gha. Gautama then went away with
<>his load of gold.
<NI>Gautama returned to S4abara1laya and there married a
<>S4u1dra lady and begot evil sons. The devas were

<>he who had chased a deer in hot haste for some dis-

<NI>Gavija1ta, son of the sage and a devotee of Devi1 heard

<>to study details about the incident he pronounced the
<>following curse. “Whoever might be the person who
<>threw a dead snake about my father's neck, he will be
<>bitten to death by Taks2aka within seven days from
<>today.” Only after the curse was pronounced did he
<>understand that it was King Pari1ks2it who had become

<>emperor Pr2thu. Pr2thu had two sons called Antardha1na
<>and Va1di1. A son called Havirdha1na was born to Antar-
<>dha1na by S4ikhan2d2i1; he (Havirdha1na) married Dhis2an2a1
<>born in the family of Agni and they had six sons called
<>Pra1ci1nabarhis, S4ukra, Gaya, Kr2s2n2a, Vraja and Ajina.
<>(Harivam3s4a, Chapter 2, Verse 31).
<HI>GAYA V. A King, a descendant of Dhruva. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 18). [Page288-a+ 65]
<HI>GA1YAKA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 67, Chap-
<>ter 85, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GAYAPARVATAM. A sacred mountain. Yamara1ja
<>honoured it on a particular occasion. Brahmasaras

<>is considered to be excellent. (See Gaya1ti1rtha).
<HI>GAYAS4IRAS. A peak of Gaya Mountain; it is also
<>known as Gayas4i1rs2a. (Vana Parva, Chapter 87).
<HI>GAYAS4I1RS2A. See Gayas4iras.
<HI>GAYA1TI1RTHA. The following story is told in the Agni
<>Pura1n2a about the origin of this very reputed sacred
<>place at Gaya1.
<NI>An asura called Gaya was once performing
<>tapas here. As the intensity of his tapas went
<>on increasing, the Devas got nervous and they
<>approached Vis2n2u with the request that he should
<>save them from Gaya1sura. Vis2n2u agreed to oblige
<>them. Meantime the intensity of Gaya's tapas increa-
<>sed daily. Ultimately Vis2n2u appeared to Gaya and as
<>requested by him granted him the boon to the effect
<>that he would become more holy and sanctified than
<>all the ti1rthas in the world.
<NI>Brahma1 and other Devas became afraid of Gaya's
<>power and prowess and they complained about him to
<>Vis2n2u, who advised Brahma1 to request Gaya for his
<>body in order to perform a yajn5a. Brahma1 did so and
<>Gaya lay down on earth so that the Yajn5a might be
<>performed on his body. Brahma1 began the yajn5a on his
<>head, and made an offering when the body of Gaya
<>was not stationary or quiet. When told about this fact
<>Vis2n2u called up Dharmadeva (See Mari1ci, Para 3) and
<>told him thus: “You please hold devas4ila1 (a divine
<>stone) on the body of Gaya, and let all the Devas sit
<>upon it, and I shall be seated on the stone along with
<>the Devas, holding the gada1 (club) in my hands.”
<NI>Dharmadeva did as he was bidden by Vis2n2u. The body
<>of Gaya stopped shaking as soon as Vis2n2u sat upon the
<>stone, and Brahma1 made the full offerings. Thenceforth
<>the place became a holy tirtha under the name Gaya1.
<>After the yajn5a was over Brahma1 gave the Gaya temple
<>20,000 yards (5 Kros4a) in extent with 55 villages
<>attached to it as daks2in2a1 (fee) to the masters of the
<>ceremony. Brahma1 presented the villages to them after
<>creating therein hills purely of gold, rivers flowing
<>with milk and honey, houses built of Gold and silver
<>etc. But the brahmins who got these gifts stayed on
<>there, their avarice only on the increase perhaps.
<>Angry at this Brahma1 cursed the people of Gaya1, and
<>according to it the brahmins became illiterate and evil-
<>minded; rivers flowed with water instead of milk and
<>honey. The brahmins lamenting over their evil fate
<>submitted their grievances before Brahma1, who consol-
<>ed them thus: Well, brahmins of Gaya1, as long as
<>there exist the sun and the moon you will continue
<>to be dependent upon the Gaya1 ti1rtha for your sus-
<>tenance. Whoever comes to Gaya1 and gives offerings
<>to you and performs the due rites for the souls of the
<>departed, the souls of hundred generations of his
<>ancestors will be transfered from hell to heaven where
<>they will attain final beatitude.”
<NI>Thus did Gaya1ti1rtha become famous. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 144).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 I. One of the seven horses of Su1rya. The
<>other horses are Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1, Tris2t2ubh, [Page288-b+ 65]
<>Anus2t2ubh, and Pan3kti. (Chapter 8, Am3s4am 2, Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GA1YATRI1 II.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A glorious Vedic mantra. This
<>mantra has twentyfour letters. There are nineteen
<>categories of movable and immovable things in this world
<>and to this if the five elements are added the number
<>twentyfour is obtained. That is why the Ga1yatri1 has got
<>twentyfour letters. (Chapter 4, Bhi1s2ma Parva). At the
<>time of Tripura dahana S4iva hung this Ga1yatri1 mantra
<>as a string on the top of his chariot (Chapter 34, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<NI>2) {%The glory of Ga1yatri1.%} If one recites Ga1yatri1 once one
<>will be freed from all sins done at that time; if one
<>recites it ten times all the sins done on one day will be
<>washed away. Thus, if one recites it a hundred times
<>the sins of one month; thousand times, the sins of a
<>year; one lakh times, the sins of his life time; ten lakh
<>times, the sins of his previous birth; hundred lakh times,
<>the sins of all his births, will be washed away, If a
<>man recites it ten crore times he becomes a realised
<>soul and attains moks2a. (Navama Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%How to recite Ga1yatri1.%} It should be recited sitting
<>still with your head slightly drawn downwards with
<>your right palm open upwards, with the fingers raised
<>and bent to give the shape of the hood of a snake.
<>Starting from the centre of the ring-finger and counting
<>down and going up through the centre of the small
<>finger and touching the top lines on the ring, middle and
<>forefingers, count down to the base of the forefinger,
<>you get number ten. This is how the number of recita-
<>tions is counted. This method is called the Karama1la1
<>(hand rosary) method. This is not the only method
<>that could be used. You can use a rosary made of
<>lotus seeds or glass beads. If you are using lotus seeds
<>you should select white seeds for the rosary. (Navama
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>GA1YATRI1STHA1NA. A sacred place of northern Bha1-
<>rata. If one spends one night here one will get the
<>benefit of giving away as gifts a thousand cows. (S4loka
<>28, Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<HI>GERU. A mineral obtained from mountains. (S4loka 95,
<>Chapter 158, Vana Parva).
<HI>GH ({#G#}). This letter has two meanings: (1) Bell (2) a
<>blow or assault; striking or killing. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 348).
<HI>GHANAPA1T2HA. A particular system of Vedic studies.
<>There are four such systems. The system of separating
<>each word from conjunctions and combinations and
<>combining with the word just before and after it is
<>called Jat2a1pa1t2ha. Jat2a1pa1t2ha means joined or combined
<>Pa1t2ha. Ghanapa1t2ha is there to avoid errors in Jat2a1pa1t2ha
<>Ghanapa1t2ha consists of padapa1t2ha and Kramapa1t2ha.
<>In Padapa1t2ha the split words are once more combined
<>and Pra1tis4a1khya lays down the rules to combine words.
<>It is because of this scientific system of reciting that
<>the R2gveda remains to this day pure in text without
<>different readings.
<HI>GHAN2T2A. I. A brahmin born in Vasis2t2ha's family. He
<>spent hundred years worshipping S4iva. Once Ghan2t2a
<>asked sage Devala to give his daughter in marriage to
<>him. But Ghan2t2a's ugliness stood in the way. So he
<>abducted the daughter of the sage and married her.
<>Enraged at this Devala cursed and turned him into an [Page289-a+ 62]
<>owl. He was also given redemption from the curse that
<>he would regain his form the day he helped Indra-
<>dyumna. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<HI>GHAN2T2A II. See under Ghan2t2a1karn2a.
<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A I.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ghan2t2a and Karn2a were two Ra1ks2asa bro-
<>thers who attained salvation by worshipping Vis2n2u.
<>(Bha1gavata, das4ama Skandha). But the elder brother,
<>Ghan2t2a alone is sometimes called by the name Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a in the Pura1n2as.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} There is a reference in Da1rukavadha (killing
<>of Da1ruka1sura) about the birth of Ghan2t2a1kar2n2a.
<>Da1ruka, after having secured a boon from Brahma1, used
<>to harass the world too much and when his depre-
<>dation hecame unbearable S4iva created Bhadraka1li1
<>from his third eye and she killed the asura. Mandodari1
<>wife of Da1ruka and daughter of Maya was sunk in
<>grief at the death of her husband. She began to do
<>tapas. S4iva appeared and gave her a few drops of sweat
<>from his body saying that the person on whom she
<>sprinkled the sweat drops would suffer from small-pox
<>and that such patients would worship her (Mandodari1)
<>and supply her necessary food. From that day onwards
<>Mandodari1 became the presiding deity over small-pox.
<>On her way back to the earth with the sweat-drops
<>Mandodari1 met Bhadraka1li1 at whom she threw the sweat-
<>drops to take revenge for her husband's death. Immedi-
<>ately Bhadraka1li1 fell down with an attack of small-pox.
<>Hearing about the mishap S4iva created a terrible
<>Ra1ks2asa called Ghan2t2a1karn2a. According to S4iva's
<>directions Ghan2t2a1karn2a licked off the small-pox from
<>Bhadraka1li1's body. But, when he tried to lick it off from
<>her face she prevented him saying that she and Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a were sister and brother and that it was improper
<>for the brother to lick the face of the sister. And, even
<>to this day the small-pox on Bhadraka1li1's face remains
<>as an ornament to her.
<NI>3) {%The name Ghan2t2a1karn2a.%} This Ra1ks2asa, at first, was
<>an enemy of Vis2n2u, and did not tolerate even the men-
<>tion of Vis2n2u's name. Therefore, he went about always
<>wearing a bell so that the tinkling of it warded off the
<>name of Vis2n2u from entering his ears. Because he wore
<>a ghan2t2a1 (bell) in his Karn2as (ears) he came to be
<>known as Ghan2t2a1karn2a. (M.B. Bhavis2ya Parva, Chap-
<>ter 80).
<NI>4) {%Turned out to be a devotee of Vis2n2u.%} Ghan2t2a1karn2a
<>became a servant of Kubera. Once he did tapas for
<>salvation. S4iva appeared and asked him to do tapas to
<>please Vis2n2u as Vis2n2u was greater than himself (S4iva).
<>From that day onwards he removed the bells from his
<>ears and became a devotee of Vis2n2u. (Bhavis2ya Parva,
<>Chapter 80).
<NI>5) {%Attained salvation.%} Handing over charge of govern-
<>ment to Sa1tyaki S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a once went to Kaila1sa moun-
<>ted on Garud2a to see S4iva. On his way he dismounted
<>at the Badarya1s4rama, and while sitting deep in medi-
<>tation there he heard the thundering voice of Pis4a1cas
<>(souls of dead people roaming about without attaining
<>salvation). He also heard the barking of dogs, and thus
<>he understood that Pis4a1cas were hunting animals. The
<>hunters came to Kr2s2n2a's presence. They were led by
<>Ghan2t2a1karn2a who was reciting the name of Vis2n2u. S4ri1 [Page289-b+ 64]
<>Kr2s2n2a felt pity for him. Ghan2t2a1karn2a told Kr2s2n2a that
<>his aim and ambition were to see Vis2n2u and that S4iva
<>had blessed that he would realise his ambition at
<>Badarya1s4rama. Pleased at all this, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a revealed
<>his Vis4varu1pa (representing in his person the whole
<>universe), and at once Ghan2t2a1karn2a brought half of the
<>corpse of a brahmin and submitted it as a present
<>before the Lord. He explained to Kr2s2n2a that according
<>to the custom of the Ra1ks2asas that was the best present
<>which could be made. Without accepting the present
<>Kr2s2n2a patted Ghan2t2a1karn2a on his back with the result
<>that he cast off his body and rose up to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>(Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a, Chapters 80-82 and also Bha1gavata,
<>Das4ama Skandha).
<NI>6) {%Ghan2t2a1karn2a Pratis2t2ha1.%} (Installation of his idol in
<>temples). Though Ghan2t2a1karn2a was a Ra1ks2asa, as he
<>attained Vaikun2t2ha due to the blessings of God Al-
<>mighty his idol is still installed in temples and wor-
<>shipped. The installation ceremony is described in
<>Chapter 59 of the Agni Pura1n2a thus: “Ghan2t2a1karn2a
<>should have 18 hands. He cures diseases born as a result
<>of sins. He holds in his right hand Vajra, sword,
<>Cakra, arrow etc. And in his left hand broom, sword, cord
<>bell, pickaxe etc. He also holds the tris4u1la (trident).
<NI>Ghan2t2a1karn2a who turned out to be a Deva is believed
<>to cure small-pox.
<HI>GHAN2T2A1KARN2A II. One of the four attendants pre-
<>sented by Brahma1 to Subrahman2ya. Nandisena, Lohi-
<>ta1ks2a, Ghan2t2a1karn2a and Kumudama1li1 are the four
<>attendants. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verses 23-24).
<HI>GHAN2T2ODARA. An asura, who was a member of
<>Varun2a's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 9, Verse
<>134).
<HI>GHARMA. A King of the An3ga royal dynasty.
<HI>GHAT2A. An urban area in ancient India. (Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 63).
<HI>GHAT2A. A notorious thief. He had a friend called
<>Karpara. They were jointly known as Gha1t2akarparas.
<>Once both the friends went to commit theft. Leaving
<>Ghat2a at the door-steps Karpara entered the chamber
<>of the princess who after enjoying sexual pleasures
<>with him gave him some money asking him to repeat
<>such visits in future. Karpara told Ghat2a all that had
<>happened and handed over to him the money which the
<>princess had given him. Karpara went again to the
<>princess. But, owing to the weariness caused by the
<>night's enjoyment both the princess and he slept till late
<>in the morning. Meantime the palace guards found out
<>the secret and took the lovers into custody. Karpara
<>was sentenced to death and led out to be hanged. Ghat2a
<>was present on the spot and Karpara asked him secretly
<>to save the princess. Accordingly Ghat2a, without any-
<>body knowing about it, took the princess over to his
<>house.
<NI>The King ordered enquiries about the absence of the
<>princess. Under the natural presumption that some
<>relation or other of Karpara alone might have carried
<>away his daughter the King ordered the guards of Kar-
<>para's corpse to arrest anybody who approached the
<>corpse and expressed grief. Ghat2a came to know of this
<>secret order of the King. Next day evening Ghat2a posing
<>himself as a drunkard and with a servant disguised as
<F>1. According to certain Pura1nas Ghan2t2a1karn2as are two individuals, Ghan2t2a and Karn2a. The term Ghan2t2a1karn2a--singular number--
<>is used because the brothers were inseparable from each other.</F> [Page290-a+ 65]
<>a woman walking in front and with another servant
<>carrying rice mixed with dhatu1ra1 (a poisonous fruit)
<>following him came to the guards keeping watch over
<>Karpara's body. Ghat2a gave the poisoned rice to the
<>guards who after eating it swooned under the effect.
<>Ghat2a used the opportunity to burn the corpse of
<>Karpara there itself. After that Ghat2a disappeared.
<NI>The King then deputed new guards to watch over the
<>funeral pyre of Karpara as he anticipated some one to
<>come to pick his charred bones from the pyre. But,
<>Ghat2a put the guards into a swoon by a mantra he had
<>learned from a sannya1sin and went away with the bones
<>of his friend.
<NI>Realising now that further stay there was not safe Ghat2a
<>left the place with the princess and the sannya1sin. But,
<>the princess, who had already fallen in love with the
<>sannya1sin poisoned Ghat2a to death.
<HI>GHAT2AJA1NUKA. A sage who was a prominent member
<>in Yudhis2t2hira's assembly. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 4).
<>Once, S4ri1 Krs2n2a, on his way to Hastina1pura met this
<>sage. (Udyoga Parva, Chapter 38).
<HI>GHAT2AKARPARA. One of the nine great poets in
<>Sanskrit reputed as the nine gems in Vikrama1ditya's
<>court.
<NI>“Dhanvantari--Ks2apan2ak A1marasim3ha--S4an3ku--Veta1la-
<>bhat2t2a--Ghat2akarpara--Ka1lida1sa1h2”. A poem of twen-
<>ty-two verses in Sanskrit called Ghat2akarpara ka1vya is
<>attributed to him. The theme of the poem is a message
<>despatched by the hero to his wife who has only recently
<>been married. All the stanzas are in yamaka (repeating
<>a word or set of words to convey different meanings at
<>the end of each line). By composing a poem called
<>‘Nalodaya’, Ka1lida1sa answered the challenge posed by
<>Ghat2akarpara in the use of Yamaka. Ghat2akarpara
<>answered Ka1lida1sa in the following stanza.
<Poem>Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te
<>nimajjati1ndoriti yo babha1s2e /
<>nu1nam na dr2s2t2am3 kavina1pi tena
<>da1ridryados2o gun2ara1s4ina1s4i1.</Poem>
<>(Ka1lida1sa, in verse 3, Canto 1 of Kuma1rasam3bhava
<>had written ‘Eko hi dos2o gun2asannipa1te nimajjati1ndoh2
<>kiran2es2viva1n3kah2”. In the above verse by Ghat2akarpara
<>the usage ‘Kavina1pi tena’ may be interpreted in two
<>ways, viz. Kavina1+api+tena and Kavi+na1pitena. By
<>the second combination Ghat2akarpara converted Ka1li-
<>da1sa into a barber (na1pita).
<HI>GHAT2IKA1. A measure of time equal to 24 minutes.
<>Sixty vina1d2ika1s make one Ghat2ika1. (See Ka1lama1na).
<HI>GHAT2OTKACA.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Ghat2otkaca, son of Bhi1masena played a very
<>important part in the story of Maha1bha1rata. He was,
<>from his very birth, a staunch friend and ally of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. He courted a hero's death in the great war.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} On the burning of the ‘lac Palace’ the
<>Pa1n2d2avas escaped through a tunnel and reached a forest.
<>While they were sleeping on the ground, Hid2im3ba the
<>Ra1ks2asa chief in the forest saw the Pa1n2d2avas from the
<>top of a tree, and he deputed his sister Hid2imbi1 to
<>bring over the Pa1n2d2avas to him for food.
<NI>Hid2im3bi1 approached the Pa1n2d2avas in the guise of a
<>beautiful woman. She was attracted towards Bhi1ma
<>and she prayed for the return of his love, which Bhi1ma
<>refused. Impatient at the delay Hid2im3ba rushed to-
<>wards the Pa1n2d2avas, and in the duel that ensued
<>between him and Bhi1ma, he was killed by Bhi1ma. [Page290-b+ 65]
<NI>Then Hid2im3bi1 approached Kunti1 and requested her to
<>ask Bhi1ma to marry her. The Pa1n2d2avas agreed to the
<>proposal on condition that Bhi1ma and Hid2im3bi1 should
<>enjoy their honeymoon in the forest and on mountains,
<>but Bhi1ma should return to them at dusk everyday.
<>Ghat2otkaca was the son born to Bhi1ma and Hid2imbi1,
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 155).
<NI>Indra bestowed on Ghat2otkaca prowess enough to be a
<>suitable opponent to Karn2a. (A1di Parva, Chapter 155,
<>Verse 47).
<NI>Ghat2otkaca grew up to become a good friend of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. When Hid2im3bi1 and Ghat2otkaca took leave of
<>them Kunti1 said to Ghat2otkaca: “You are the eldest
<>son to the Pa1n2d2avas. You should be ever a support to
<>them.” To this Ghat2otkaca answered that he would
<>return to them whenever any need arose for it.
<NI>3) {%Carried the Pa1n2d2avas on shoulders.%} During their exile
<>in the forest the Pa1n2d2avas became too tired to walk any
<>further when Bhi1ma remembered Ghat2otkaca, who
<>promptly appeared before the Pa1n2d2avas, and at the
<>instance of Bhi1ma got down a number of Ra1ks2asas also.
<>Ghat2otkaca carrying Pa1n5ca1li1 on his shoulders, and the
<>Ra1ks2asas carrying the Pa1n2d2ava brothers on their
<>shoulders went by air to Badarika1s4rama where
<>Narana1ra1yan2as were doing tapas, landed them there,
<>and then they (Ghat2otkaca and his companions) took
<>leave of the Pa1n2d2avas. (Vana Parva, Chapter 145).
<NI>4) {%Ghat2otkaca in the great war.%} (1) In the first day's
<>fighting he fought against Alambus2a, Duryodhana and

<>fight the Kauravas purposely postponed that day's
<>fighting. (Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapters, 45, 57, 58).
<NI>(2) He defeated the King of Van3ga and killed his

<NI>(14) Karn2a clashed with Ghat2otkaca and failing to
<>kill him by any means he (Karn2a) used Vaijayanti1
<>S4akti as the last resort. This S4akti had been given to
<>him by Indra in exchange for his head-gear and ear-
<>rings, and Karn2a had been keeping the S4akti in res-
<>erve to kill Arjuna. At any rate Karn2a used it against [Page291-a+ 65]
<>Ghat2otkaca and he was killed. After killing Ghat2ot-
<>kaca the S4akti entered the sphere of the stars. (Dron2a
<>Parva, Chapter 180).

<HI>GHR2TA1CI1.
<NI>1) {%General.%} She was an exceptionally beautiful apsara1
<>woman, and she revelled in disturbing the peace of
<>the sages and becoming mother of children by them.
<>Ghr2ta1ci1, who succeeded in breaking the penance of
<>the sages like Kus4ana1bha, Vya1sa and Bharadva1ja
<>occupied a very prominent position among apsara1
<>women.
<NI>2) {%S4uka, the son of Vya1sa.%} Vya1sa longed very much to have
<>a son. Ultimately, after receiving instruction and advice
<>from Na1rada, he reached the peaks of Maha1meru and
<>worshipped Maha1deva and Maha1devi1 for one year
<>with the one-syllabled mantra OM which is the very
<>seed of word. By now the great tejas (effulgence) of
<>Vya1sa lighted up the whole world and Indra got ner-
<>vous and upset. The great Lord S4iva appeared on the
<>scene and blessed Vya1sa that he will have a son who
<>would become a very wise man, very much interested
<>in helping others, and very famous also. Vya1sa returned
<>gratified to his a1s4rama. One day, while in the process
<>of preparing the sticks for producing fire, thoughts [Page291-b+ 64]
<>about a son passed through his mind. Fire is produced by
<>the rubbing of two sticks. But, he thought, how
<>could he who had no wife, become the father of a son?
<>While immersed in such thoughts he saw Ghr2ta1ci1
<>standing near him, herself having come along the sky.
<>Vya1sa did not like the presence of Ghr2ta1ci1. Fearing
<>the curse of Vya1sa she assumed the form of a parrot and
<>flew away.
<NI>The beauty of Ghr2ta1ci1 as also the flight of the parrot
<>kindled erotic feelings in Vya1sa and seminal emission
<>occurred. The semen fell on the stick used for produc-
<>ing fire, and without knowing the fact he went on
<>using the sticks for producing fire. And, then did
<>appear from it a son of divine lustre. That son became
<>reputed in later years as sage S4uka. (Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata, Prathama Skandha).
<NI>3) {%Two children by Bharadva1ja.%} Once sage Bharadva1ja was
<>taking his bath in the Gan3ga1, Ghr2ta1ci1 also came to
<>bathe. On the banks of the river her clothes caught
<>something and were removed from their position. The
<>sight of it caused seminal emission to the Sage. The
<>semen thus emitted was kept in a Dron2a, (bamboo cup)
<>and when it was due the Dron2a broke and out
<>of it came a child. It was this child which, in later
<>years, became so very famous as the great Dron2a1ca1rya.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 149). On another occasion also,
<>the sight of Ghr2ta1ci1 caused emission in Bharadva1ja,
<>and S4ruta1vati1 or S4ruva1vati1 was the noble daughter
<>born out of it. (S4alya Parva, Chapter 48, Verse 63).
<NI>{%Hundred daughters of Kus4ana1bha.%} Kus4ana1bha, son of Kus4a
<>was a saintly king. Once Kus4ana1bha fell in love with
<>Ghr2ta1ci1 and a hundred daughters were born to him
<>of her. Once Wind-God felt enamoured of the
<>hundred girls, but they refused to satisfy his desire. So
<>he cursed them to become crooked or bent down in body.
<>Later on, Brahmadatta, son of the sage Cu1li, straightened
<>their bodies and married them. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Canto 32).
<NI>5) {%Birth of Ruru.%} On another occasion Ghr2ta1ci1 attract-
<>ed and subjugated a King called Pramati. Ruru was the
<>son born to Pramati by Ghr2ta1ci1.
<NI>6) {%Other information.%} (1) Once Ghr2ta1ci1 pleased Sage
<>As2t2a1vakra, who introduced her into Kubera's assembly.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 19, Verse 44).
<NI>(2) Ghr2ta1ci1 danced at the birthday celebrations of
<>Arjuna. (A1di Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 65).
<NI>(3) A daughter called Citra1n3gada1 was born to Vis4vakar-
<>man by Ghr2ta1ci1. (See under Vis4vakarma1).
<NI>(4) A daughter called Devavati1 was born to Ghr2ta1ci1.
<>(See under Devavati1).
<HI>GHR2TAPAS A great sage who lived on ghee. A disciple
<>of Brahma1 he was an instructor of Sana1tana Dharma.
<>(S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 166, Verse 24).
<HI>GHR2TAPR2S2T2HA. A son of Priyavrata, brother of
<>Utta1napa1da. Sva1yambhuvamanu had two famous sons
<>called Priyavrata and Utta1napa1da. Priyavrata, the elder
<>son, married two daughters of Vis4vakarmapraja1pati
<>called Suru1pa1 and Barhis2mati1, and of Suru1pa1 were born
<>ten sons called Agni1dhra, Idhmajihva, Yajn5aba1hu,
<>Maha1vi1ra, Rukmas4ukra, Ghr2tapr2s2t2ha, Savana, Medha1-
<>tithi and Vi1tihotra, and also one daughter called

<HI>GIRIGAHVARA. A place of habitation on the north-
<>eastern side of Bha1rata. (S4loka 42, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>GIRIKA1. Wife of Uparicaravasu. This gem of a lady
<>was the daughter of the river S4uktimati1. There is a story
<>behind her marrying Uparicara.
<NI>S4uktimati1 was a river flowing through the capital city
<>of the kingdom of Uparicara. Once the mountain
<>Kola1hala driven by amorous desires subdued S4uktimati1.
<>The next morning on finding no river in its place the
<>people were surprised. The news reached the ears of the
<>King. He became furious and rushing to the mountain
<>gave it a hard kick. It created a hole in the mountain
<>and the river flowed through it. But by that time
<>Kola1hala had got a son and a daughter of S4uktimati1.
<>Greatly pleased at the King for setting her free from
<>Kola1hala, S4uktimati1 gave her children to the King. The
<>King brought up the son and made him the chief of his
<>army. The girl was brought up and named Girika1 and
<>when she was of marriagable age the King married her.
<NI>When once Girika1 was having her monthly period the
<>King was forced to go to the forests for hunting. While
<>in the forests he saw the animals having sexual acts and
<>as he thought of Girika1 at home he had emission. He
<>never wanted to waste the seminal fluid. He wrapped it
<>in a leaf and sent it to his wife through a kite. Another
<>kite thinking it to be something to eat attacked the packet
<>and it fell into a river down below. A fish swallowed it
<>and later when a fisherman caught it and opened its
<>belly a boy and a girl came out of it. The girl was
<>Satyavati1 mother of Vya1sa. (10th Skandha, Devi1
<>Bha1gavata).

<HI>GIRIVRAJA. A city which has gained great importance
<>in all the Pura1n2as of India.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} There was once a King named Kus4a in the
<>Pu1ru dynasty. (For genealogy see under ‘Ga1dhi’).
<>This Kus4a begot of his wife, Vaidarbhi1, four sons
<>named Kus4a1mba, Kus4ana1bha, Asu1rtarajasa and Vasu.
<>Each of them built a city of his own and started his
<>rule there. Girivraja is the magnificent city built by

<NI>2) {%Jara1sandha's rule.%} Vasu had a son named Br2had2ratha
<>and Jara1sandha was the son of Br2hadratha. During the
<>rule of Jara1sandha Girivraja became glorious like
<>Nandanodya1na. This city lying in the midst of five
<>mountains was the seat of prosperity then. (Chapter 21,
<>Sabha1 Parva). Jara1sandha kept many mighty kings of
<>his time, as prisoners in this city. Unable to control
<>his wrath against Kr2s2n2a once he hurled his mace a
<>hundred times and threw it from Girivraja to Mathura1.
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, Bhi1masena and Arjuna entered Girivraja in [Page292-b+ 64]
<>disguise and engaging Jara1sandha in a duel killed him
<>and crowned his son as King. (Chapter 24, Sabha1

<HI>GODA1. A follower of Skandadeva. (S4loka 28, Chapter
<>46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GODA1NA. In ancient India it was believed to be a very
<>great deed of moral merit to give cows as gifts. If one
<>buys cows with the hereditary wealth and gives them
<>as gifts one would reach an ever prosperous world and
<>even one who buys cows with the money received by
<>gambling and gives them as gifts would live for several
<>years enjoying prosperity. (Chapter 73, Anus4a1sana

<>Godila was travelling by air he saw Padma1vati1, wife [Page293-a+ 65]
<>of Ugrasena, King of Vidarbha, bathing in a pond
<>along with her companions. The very sight of the
<>enchanting Padma1vati1 roused carnal passions in him
<>and the Yaks2a took the form of Ugrasena and started
<>singing from the top of a hillock nearby. Padma1vati1
<>went to him because she mistook him for her husband.
<>Embracing her passionately the Yaks2a outraged her
<>modesty. Subtle differences in the act created doubts
<>in Padma1vati1 and, on being questioned, the Yaks2a told
<>the truth and left the place. (Chapter 49, Padma
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOHARAN2APARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of
<>Maha1bha1rata. See under ‘Maha1bha1rata’.
<HI>GOHATYA1. In ancient India killing of cows was con-
<>sidered to be a great sin. It is interesting to note the
<>punishment prescribed for this crime in the Agni
<>Pura1n2a. For one month he should drink barley water
<>only. He should live in a cow-shed wearing the hide of
<>the cow he has killed. He can have some supper and
<>that too without salt He must bathe for two months in
<>cow's urine. During day time he should follow the cows
<>looking after their comfort. He should drink the
<>menstrual discharge with his face lifted upwards.
<>Fasting, he should give away as charity ten cows and a
<>bull. If not, he should give as charity all his wealth to
<>god-fearing brahmins. If a man only stops the cow for
<>others to kill he should bear a fourth of the punishment;
<>if he stops and ties it for killing he should bear half of
<>the punishment and if he stops it, ties it and gives the
<>weapon for killing he should bear three-fourths of the
<>punishment. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 159),

<>Ya1tukarn2a. (Skandha 12, Bha1gavata).
<HI>GOKARN2A I. See under Gokarn2a.
<HI>GOKARN2A II. An incarnation of S4iva. In the seventh
<>Vara1hakalpa S4iva was born as Gokarn2a and he then
<>got four sons named, Kas4yapa, Us4anas, Cyavana and
<>Br2haspati. (S4atarudrasam3hita1, S4iva Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOKARN2A1. In the great battle Karn2a sent a serpent-
<>missile against Arjuna. The serpent named As4vasena
<>was the power behind the missile and Gokarn2a1 was the
<>mother of that serpent. (S4loka 42, Chapter 90, Karn2a
<>Parva).
<HI>GOKARN2A. A sacred place of Pura1n2ic importance
<>situated on the extreme north of Kerala.
<NI>(1) {%Origin.%} There was once on the banks of the river,
<>Tun3gabhadra1, a village made sacred and prosperous by
<>the brahmins who lived there. In that village lived a
<>noble brahmin named A1tmadeva. His wife was a
<>quarrelsome woman named Dhundhuli1. Even after many
<>years of married life they got no children and
<>A1tmadeva, greatly grief-stricken, left his home and
<>went to the forests. He was sitting on the shore of a
<>lake after quenching his thirst from it when a
<>Sannya1sin came that way. A1tmadeva told him about his
<>domestic life and pleaded that he should suggest a way to
<>get a son for him. The sannya1sin sat in meditation for
<>some time and contemplated on the horoscope of
<>A1tmadeva and regretfully informed him that according
<>to his horoscope he was to have no children for seven
<>successive births. He, therefore, advised A1tmadeva to [Page293-b+ 65]
<>abandon all his worldly pleasures and accept sannya1sa
<>for the rest of his life. But A1tmadeva was not to be
<>discouraged by this prophecy and he urged the
<>sannya1sin to help him somehow to get a child. The
<>sanya1sin then gave him a fruit and asked him to give it
<>to his wife and ask her to observe a life of fasting for a
<>period of one year.
<NI>Greatly pleased with this boon A1tmadeva returned to
<>his house and told his wife all that had happened and
<>gave her the fruit. She liked to eat the fruit but a
<>year's fasting seemed troublesome to her. She was
<>thinking of how to get over this difficulty when her
<>younger sister came to her and suggested a plan. She
<>said “Sister, I am pregnant. I shall give you the
<>child I deliver. You can declare it as your child and
<>make your husband believe so. You can announce in
<>public that you have eaten the fruit and have conse-
<>quently become pregnant. We can, to test its merit,
<>give the fruit to a cow.” Dhundhuli1 liked the plan very
<>much and so did everything like that.
<NI>The news that Dhundhuli1 was pregnant spread in the
<>city. Very soon her sister gave birth to a child and
<>that child was proclaimed as the child of Dhundhuli1. On
<>the pretext that Dhundhuli1 was short of breast-milk her
<>sister started doing the breast-feeding. The child was
<>named Dhundhuka1ri.
<NI>After three months the cow that ate the fruit delivered
<>a child. The ear of the child was like that of a cow
<>and so he was called Gokarn2a. Dhundhuka1ri and
<>Gokarn2a grew together. Dhundhuka1ri became a very
<>evil-natured boy while Gokarn2a grew into a scholarly
<>one. Dhundhuka1ri who was the very seat of everything
<>bad made the life of their parents wretched and the
<>disappointed A1tmadeva renounced all and went to the
<>forests and did penance and attained moks2a. Unable
<>to bear the torture by her son, Dhundhuli1 committed
<>suicide by jumping into a well. Gokarn2a started on a
<>pilgrimage.
<NI>Dhundhuka1ri lived in his own house surrounded by
<>prostitutes. Thieving was his only means of livelihood.
<>Knowing this the servants of the king started to capture
<>Dhundhuka1ri and the prostitutes who lived with him,
<>for their safety, bound Dhundhuka1ri with ropes and put
<>him into fire and killed him. The soul of Dhundhuka1ri
<>became a great phantom. Hearing the news of the
<>death of his brother, Gokarn2a returned home. He
<>conducted a s4ra1ddha at Gaya1 to give peace to the soul
<>of his departed brother. But the phantom of Dhundhu-
<>ka1ri was not pacified. This phantom troubled him
<>always. Gokarn2a was not afraid of it and asked him
<>what he wanted and the phantom pleaded that in some
<>way Gokarn2a should get him absolved of all his sins.
<>Gokarn2a then consulted Pandits to know what method
<>should be adopted to save a soul which could not be
<>saved even by a Gaya1-S4ra1ddha. The Pandits advised
<>him to do penance to propitiate the Sun. The Sun who
<>appeared before Gokarn2a as a result of his penance
<>declared that if he did read the entire Bha1gavata in
<>seven days Dhundhuka1ri would get moks2a. So Gokarn2a
<>performed a Sapta1ha and among those who assembled
<>to hear it was the phantom of Dhundhuka1ri also. The
<>phantom finding no place to sit crept into a seven-
<>layered bamboo and sat there listening to Gokarn2a.
<>When the first day was over the first layer broke and it
<>went on like that every day and on the seventh day the [Page294-a+ 63]
<>seventh layer broke and when Gokarn2a finished
<>the twelfth Skandha the phantom rose from the
<>bamboo to heaven. When it was going to heaven it
<>looked at Gokarn2a and told him that his moks2a was due
<>to the result of his hearing the sapta1ha reading. When
<>Gokarn2a asked him why none of the others who heard
<>it got it he said that it was because none had heard it
<>with such rapt attention as he had done.
<NI>Gokarn2a then conducted another reading of Sapta1ha
<>and the people present heard the same with rapt
<>attention. When the reading was over, a chariot of
<>Vis2n2u from Vaikun2t2ha descended and carried
<>away all those who heard the reading. The place
<>where Gokarn2a sat and read the Sapta1ha became
<>known later as the famous Gokarn2a. (Chapters 1 to 3,
<>Bha1gavata Ma1ha1tmya).
<NI>2) {%Mitrasaha and Gokarn2a.%} A King of Ayodhya1 named
<>Mitrasaha who became famous by the name of
<>Kalma1s2apa1da, became a demon by a curse of Vasis2t2ha.
<>He attained moks2a by living and worshipping God in
<>the temple at Gokarn2a. (See under S4ivara1tri for
<>details).
<NI>3) {%Gokarn2a and the origin of Kerala.%} Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a
<>gives a story associating Gokarn2a with the origin of
<>Kerala.
<NI>By the request of Bhagi1ratha the river Gan3ga1 fell on
<>earth and flowing as different brooks emptied its waters
<>in the ocean. The level of the water in the ocean went
<>up and the temple of Gokarn2a and the land of Kerala
<>were submerged in waters. The sages who were in the
<>temple somehow escaped and took refuge on the
<>mountain Sahya. Paras4ura1ma was doing penance there
<>then and the sages went to him and told him of their
<>plight. Paras4ura1ma went and stood in Gokarn2a and
<>threw an axe to the south. All the land from Gokarn2a
<>up to the place where the axe fell rose up from the
<>ocean to form a piece of land which was named Kerala.

<>ter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GOTAMA. A sage named Gotama, son of Rahu1gan2a,
<>is found everywhere in R2gveda. The seventyfourth
<>su1kta in the thirteenth anuva1ka of the first man2d2ala of
<>R2gveda is composed by this sage. There are many other
<>su1ktas also in his name. This sage is not the Gautama,
<>husband of Ahalya1, who made Su1kta 58, Anuvaka 11,
<>Man2d2ala 1 of R2gveda.
<NI>Once this Gotama tired of thirst asked the Maruts for
<>some water. The Maruts took a huge well to his side
<>and poured water into a big pot. (Su1ktas 86, 87,
<>Anuva1ka 14, Man2d2ala 1, R2gveda).

<>Savana, Anagha, Sutapas and S4ukra. These holy men
<>were saptars2is in the third Manvantara. (Chapter 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>GOVARDHANA. A mountain of Amba1d2i (Gokula).
<>This is believed to be a form of Kr2s2n2a. This is called
<>Girira1ja also. The residents of Amba1d2i from time imme-
<>morial used to worship Indra for getting rains. But
<>after the advent of Kr2s2n2a there came a change in that
<>belief. Kr2s2n2a told them that rains depended on Govar-
<>dhana and it was enough if they worshipped that moun-
<>tain and so the residents of Amba1d2i started worshipping
<>the mountain. Indra got enraged at this and sent heavy
<>rains to Amba1d2i1 intending to submerge it in water. But
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a lifted the mountain over Amba1d2i like an um-
<>brella and saved the city from the wrath of
<>Indra. See under ‘Kr2s2n2a’ for more details. (Das4ama
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata)
<HI>GOVA1SANA. A King of the country called S4ivi. The
<>daughter of this King, Devika1, married Yudhis2t2hira in a
<>svayam3vara. Once Gova1sana met in a duel the son of
<>Abhibhu1, King of Ka1s4i1. (S4loka 38, Chapter 95, Dron2a
<>Parva).
<HI>GOVA1SANA(M3). A country of ancient India. The people
<>of this place presented Yudhis2t2hira with much wealth.
<>(S4loka 5, Chapter 51, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>GOVIKARTA1. The man who puts nose-bands on
<>bullocks. (S4loka 9, Chapter 2, Vira1t2a Parva).
<HI>GOVINDA. A synonym of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a (Maha1vis2n2u). He
<>got this name because he saved the people and cows of
<>Amba1d2i by lifting the Govardhana mountain and
<>using it as an umbrella. (Da1ks2in2a1tya pa1t2ha Chapter
<>38, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>GOVINDADATTA. A brahmin of great fame who
<>resided in Bahusuvarn2aka, a city on the banks of the
<>river Gan3ga1. His wife was a very pious woman. They
<>had five children. Once when both the parents were
<>away from the house a sage called Vais4va1nara came
<>there but the children did not receive him and treat
<>him properly. Knowing this Govindadatta abandoned
<>all his children. (Katha1saritsa1gara, Katha1pi1t2halam3-
<>baka).
<HI>GOVINDAGIRI. A mountain of Kraun5cadvi1pa. (S4loka

<HI>GOVINDAS4ARMAN. A brahmin who lived in olden
<>times in the city of Ka1s4i1. (See under Sim3hadhvaja).
<HI>GOVITATA. A peculiar kind of horse sacrifice. Sage
<>Kan2va once made his grandson, Bharata, conduct a
<>sacrifice of this kind. (S4loka 130, Chapter 74, A1di Parva)
<HI>GOVRAJA. A soldier of Skandadeva. (S4loka 66, Chap-
<>ter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GRAHAS (PLANETS). Indians from very ancient days
<>have maintained certain definite ideas and inferences
<>about the planets. Though those ideas differ somewhat
<>from the results of modern researches, the influence of
<>the ancient ideas is discernible in all the Pura1n2ic texts in
<>India. The main ideas are summarised below.
<NI>Su1rya (Sun), Candra (Moon), S4ukra (Venus), Budha
<>(Mercury), Kuja (Mars), Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani
<>(Saturn), Ra1hu and Ketu are the navagrahas (the nine
<>planets).

<>Ketus4ceti navagraha1h2</Poem> [Page296-a+ 65]
<>Besides the above nine planets, Indian astronomers take
<>into account a starry sphere in the sky called Saptars2is
<>and the star called Dhruva.
<NI>1) {%Su1rya.%} The sun gives light to all the other planets.
<>It has an area of 50 crore yojanas and its distance from
<>the earth is 22 crore yojanas. S4u1rya exists within the
<>universe, and is called also Ma1rtan2d2a as it originated
<>from dead (mr2ta) egg (an2d2a). Su1rya divides the sky,
<>heaven, hell, the earth, east, west, north, south etc.
<>from one another. According to the course of Su1rya
<>three periods of time or ‘seasons’ like uttara1yan2a,
<>daks2in2a1yana and vis2uvat are caused. Five months from
<>May is the uttara1yan2a period, five months from
<>November the daks2in2a1yana period, and the months of
<>April and October are the Vis2uvats. Since during the
<>uttara1yan2a the sun rises up comparatively slowly
<>(mandagati) during this period the day is longer than
<>night. As in daks2in2a1yana the course of the sun is quic-
<>ker in pace (S4i1ghragati) night is longer than day, and
<>during vis2uvat, (samagati) day and night are of equal
<>duration.
<NI>The other planets have three positions called Jaradgava,
<>Aira1vata and Vais4va1nara, the first being the central
<>position, the second the northern position and the
<>third the southern position. Nine stars, As4vini1, Bharan2i1,
<>Kr2ttika1, Rohin2i1, Mr2gas4iras, A1rdra1, Punarvasu and
<>Pus2ya occupy the Aira1vata vi1thi1 (northern position
<>or segment). Another nine stars, Magha1, Pu1rva
<>Phalguni1, Uttara Phalguni1, Hasta, Citra1, Sva1ti1,
<>Vis4akha1, Anura1dha1 and Jyes2t2ha1 occupy the central
<>position, and the last nine stars, Mu1la, Purva1s2a1d2ha,
<>Uttara1s2a1d2ha, S4ravan2a, S4ravis2t2ha1, S4atabhis2ak, Pu1rva-
<>pros2t2hapada, Uttarapros2t2hapada and Revati1 occupy the
<>southern position.
<NI>To the east, south, west and north of Mount Maha1meru
<>exist Devadha1nika1 (Indrapuri1) Sam3yamani1 (Yamapuri1)
<>N3imlocani1 (Varun2apuri1) and Vibha1vari1 (Kuberapuri1)
<>respectively. When Su1rya appears in Devadha1nika1 it
<>will be dawn, when he has travelled to Sam3yamani1 it
<>will be noon, when he is in Nimlocani1 it will be sunset
<>and when he is in Vibha1vari1 it will be mid-night. This
<>is how S4urya circles the Maha1meru. Within 15 na1d2ika1s
<>(6 hours) the sun travels 2(1/2) crores plus 2(1/2) lakhs of
<>yojanas. Su1rya's chariot has one wheel and twelve
<>spokes. The wheel represents a year and the twelve
<>spokes stand for the twelve months of the year. The
<>chariot has also three na1bhis representing the three
<>ca1turma1syas, and six bands representing the six
<>seasons. The height of the chariot is 36 lakhs yojanas
<>and it has a width of 8 yojanas inside. Arun2adeva is the
<>charioteer, and the seven chandas are the horses. The
<>seven chandas are, Ga1yatri1, Br2hati1, Us2n2ik, Jagati1,
<>Tris2t2ubh, Anus2t2ubh and Pan3kti).
<NI>Night is called Us2a1 and day Vyus2t2i and the time in
<>between is Sandhya1. When Sandhya1 begins the terrible
<>Ra1ks2asas called Mandehas attempt to consume Su1rya.
<>They have been granted the boon that everyday they
<>will be dying though they may not be losing their
<>bodies. So, everyday there rages a fierce fight between
<>them and Su1rya. When the fight is on, noble brahmins
<>throw up water sanctified by Ga1yatri1 mantra with
<>‘Om’. The water turns into Vajra1yudha and burns the
<>Ra1ks2asas to ashes. The first offering in Agnihotra is
<>made with the recitation of the mantra beginning
<>‘Su1ryo Jyoti’ because of which the sun is able to shine [Page296-b+ 65]
<>with thousands of rays with the result that the Ra1ks2asas
<>are burned to death. The Ba1lakhilyas who number
<>more than 60,000 form Su1rya1's body-guard. (See under
<>Su1rya for Pura1n2i1c stories about him).
<NI>2) {%Candra. (The Moon).%} Candra exists at one lakh
<>yojanas away from Su1rya, and it revolves round the
<>earth. A ca1ndra month of twentyseven days is divided
<>into twelve ra1s4is (houses) viz. Sim3ha (Leo), Kanya1
<>(Virgo) Tula1 (Libra) Vr2s4cika (Scorpio) Dhanus
<>(Sagittarius) Makara (Capricorn) Kum3bha (Aquarius)
<>Mi1na (Pisces) Mes2a (Aries) Vr2s2abha (Taurus)
<>Mithuna (Gemini) and Karkat2aka (Cancer). Every
<>month Candra stays in each of the above houses only
<>for 2(1/4) days.
<NI>The full moon makes Pitr2s happy, divides the month
<>into two halves, Kr2s2n2a Paks2a (the dark fortnight)
<>and S4ukla Paks2a (the bright fortnight) and functions
<>as the very life of all living beings. The twentyseven
<>stars from As4vini1 to Revati1 are the wives of Candra.
<>There is another view that Candra has twentyeight
<>wives including another star called Abhijit. Candra has
<>another name, Sarvamaya. Candra with his pleasing
<>rays, as sweet as Amr2ta (Nectar) bestows happiness on
<>devas, Pitr2s and all other living beings. So he is called
<>Sarvamaya.
<NI>Candra's chariot has three wheels. Ten beautiful horses
<>white as Jasmine flowers draw the chariot. These
<>horses also like those of Su1rya live for a Kalpa era.
<>Because the Devas drink its digits Candra wanes into
<>one digit (Kala1). Then Su1rya makes him wax again
<>with one single ray of his called Sus2umna1. When only
<>two Kala1s of his remain Candra enters the orbit of
<>Su1rya and stays there in the ray called ‘ama1’, and that
<>day, therefore is called ama1va1sya1. And on that day
<>Candra enters waters for the first time, and after that
<>dwells in trees, creepers etc. While Candra is thus in
<>trees etc. those who cut them will be committing the
<>sin of brahmahatya1. (slaughter of a brahmin). When
<>only a little of the 15th kala1 remains on new moon day
<>hordes of Pitr2s gather round the enfeebled Candra to
<>drink him, and they drink the amr2ta kala1, one of the
<>two kala1s still remaining with him. Thus the three
<>classes of Pitr2s, Barhis2adas, Saumyas and Agnis2va1ttas
<>get absolutely satisfied for one month. Thus Candra
<>nurtures Devas in the S4ukla Paks2a and pitr2s in Kr2s2n2a
<>Paks2a, and grows trees, creepers etc. with life-giving
<>water. (For details see under Candra).
<NI>3) {%S4ukra (Venus).%} S4ukra is an auspicious Deva very
<>much interested in doing good to the world and making
<>people happy. His course is also, like that of S4u1rya, of
<>three types, intense (quick), slow and of equal pace.
<>Two-and-a-half yojanas above Su1rya, S4ukra follows a
<>course alternating in front of and behind Su1rya. S4ukra
<>never goes very far away from S4u1rya, and he possesses
<>a big chariot drawn by horses from earth. (For details
<>see under S4ukra).
<NI>4) {%Budha (Mercury).%} Though inherently auspicious
<>Budha, in contact with inauspicious planets takes their
<>character and becomes weak. Budha also has the three
<>paces, quick, slow and medium. Budha moves close to
<>Su1rya and if he moves from Su1rya storms, failure of
<>rain etc. will be the result. He is considered to be the
<>son of Candra. His chariot is made of wind and fire,
<>golden in colour and is drawn by eight horses having
<>the speed of wind. (See under Budha for more details). [Page297-a+ 65]
<NI>5) {%Kuja (Mars).%} Kuja is two lakhs of yojanas above
<>Budha, and remains in every ra1s4i (house) more or less
<>for 45 days. When the position is affected it causes
<>inauspicious experiences to living beings. The chariot
<>of Kuja is made of gold, glittering and of huge size.
<>Eight horses born from Agni draw the chariot.
<NI>6) {%Br2haspati (Jupiter).%} Jupiter travels 2 lakhs of yojanas
<>away from Kuja's sphere. Though it is an auspicious
<>planet its reverse course is productive of evil results.
<>Jupiter travels for twelve months in every ra1s4i (house).
<>His golden chariot is drawn by eight white horses. (See
<>Br2haspati).
<NI>7) {%S4ani (Saturn).%} S4ani is 2 lakhs of yojanas away from
<>Jupiter's sphere, and it stays in every house for twenty
<>months. As it moves only slowly it is called S4anais4cara
<>also. S4ani is considered to be the son of Su1rya. It is an
<>inauspicious planet. His chariot is drawn by multi-
<>coloured horses born in the sky.
<NI>8) {%Ra1hu.%} His ash-coloured chariot is drawn by eight
<>horses as dark as beetles. Once the horses are harness-
<>ed to the chariot it will always be running. On full
<>moon days Ra1hu starts from Su1rya and reaches Candra
<>and returns to Su1rya on new moon days. It is an inaus-
<>picious planet. (For details see under Ra1hu).
<NI>9) {%Ketu.%} His chariot is drawn by eight horses, which
<>have the speed of wind. It is also an inauspicious
<>planet.
<NI>10) {%Saptars2is.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<>zone of S4ani exists the Saptars2i zone. Seven mahars2is
<>are incessantly on the move in that sphere, wishing all
<>that is well for the whole world. (See Saptars2is).
<NI>11) {%Dhruva.%} Thirteen crores of yojanas away from the
<>saptars2iman2d2ala there is a place called Vis2n2upada.
<>Dhruva, son of Utta1napa1da lives there in the company
<>of Indra, Agni, Kas4yapa, Dharma and others. The
<>Dhruvaman2d2ala remains there stationary like the
<>supporting pillar of all the planets ever on the move.
<>(See Dhruva; Devi1bha1gavata 8th Skandha; Vis2n2u
<>Pura1n2a, Part II).
<NI>Astrologers aver that living beings pass through the
<>periods and positions of the following planets, viz. Ketu,
<>S4ukra (Venus) A1ditya (Sun), Candra (Moon), Kuja
<>(Mars), Ra1hu, Br2haspati (Jupiter), S4ani (Saturn) and
<>Budha (Mercury). The following table shows how
<>people born under different stars pass through the
<>different das4a1s. The order of succession of the das4a1s
<>and the period of each das4a1 can also be seen from this
<>table.
<NI>Stars (Day of birth)
<F>1. To find out your das4a1 at the time of birth, please see the above table. Any one born under any of the stars is considered born
<>in the das4a1 shown in the right hand side against that star; e. g. People born under (As4vayuk) As4vini1, Mr2gas4i1r2s2a and Mu1la are born
<>into the Ketu das4a1. So with the other stars also as shown in the above table. To calculate how long the das4a1 into which a particular person
<>is born will last requires some astrological skill; also the exact time of birth should be known. A star remains dominant for about 24
<>hours. If a man is born under a star when half this period of dominance is over, then that man will get only half the period of the corres-
<>ponding das4a1. The portion of the das4a1 that the man will get is proportionate to the period of dominance of the star. For example,
<>a man is born under the star As4vaini1 (As4vyuk) when the star is in the last quarter of the Ketu das4a1. The total period of this das4a1 is
<>7 years. But the man will get only the last quarter of it, namely about 1(3/4) years. After that he will pass on to the next das4a1--S4ukra-
<>das4a1.</F> <C2>Das4a1 <C3>Years

<HI>GRAHAPI1D2A1. (Adverse planetary effects on children)
<>Astrologers hold the view that planets affect or exercise
<>some influence on the lives of people. According to
<>that given hereunder is a brief description of planets,
<>which affect a child from its very birth as also of
<>remedial measures to keep the child free from such
<>adverse planetary effects.
<NI>On the very day of the birth of the child a female
<>planet called Pa1pini1 affects it as a result of which it will
<>refuse all food and be lying turning its head this way
<>and that. Pa1pini1 will tap the health not only of the
<>child but of the mother also. Bali (sacrificial offering
<>with flesh, fish and liquor as also waving with flowers and
<>fragrant materials and lighted lamp, and smearing the
<>child's body with sandal paste, mancetti powder, ta1tiri
<>flower, bark of pachotti, are remedies against the attack
<>of Pa1pini1. Burning of buffalo dung also is useful.
<NI>On the second night after the birth of the child another
<>female planet called Bhi1s2an2i1 attacks it. Symptoms of
<>the attack are coughing, deep breath and shrinking of
<>bodily organs. The remedies for the attack are: smearing
<>of the body with paste made in sheep's urine of tippali1
<>(long pepper), ra1macca, root of “Kat2ala1t2i” and sandal-
<>wood. The child should also be exposed to the fumes
<>got by burning the horn tooth and hairs of the cow.
<>And, with the above-mentioned things bali should be
<>offered to the planet.
<NI>On the third night the female planet called Ghan2t2a1li1
<>affects the child. Frequent crying, yawning, shivering and
<>loss of appetite are the main symptoms of the attack.
<>Smearing the body with a paste of lotus styles, an5jana
<>stone and tooth of cow and elephant mixed with goat's
<>skin is a good remedy for the illness. The child should
<>be treated with the fumes got by burning the leaves of
<>na1gun2a (a tree) and bilva and bali as aforesaid should
<>also be offered.
<NI>Ka1koli1 (female planet) affects the child on the fourth
<>night. Shivering, loss of appetite, frothing and wander-
<>ing of the eyes are the main symptoms of the attack.
<>In this case bali should be offered with liquor and
<>flesh; the body should be smeared with a paste in
<>horse's urine of elephant's tusk and the outer skin of
<>snakes. The child should also be subjected to the fume
<>of tamarind and margosa leaves.
<NI>Ham3sa1dhika1 (female planet) affects the child on the fifth
<>night. Yawning, breathing out alone and closing of
<>fingers are the main symptoms of the attack. Bali with [Page298-a+ 63]
<>fish etc. should be offered to this planet, and the child
<>smeared with a paste of goat-horn, roots of the va1tyala
<>plant, bark of pa1chotti (Tilva) manayola and harita1la.
<NI>Phalka1ri1 (female planet) attacks the child on the
<>sixth night. Startling, fainting, waking frequently from
<>sleep and crying much, loss of appetite and turning the
<>body round and round are the chief symptoms of the
<>attack. In this case bali with fish etc. is called for.
<>The child is also to be exposed to the fumes produced
<>by the burning of dried tamarind, gulgulu, Kottam
<>and elephant's tusk.
<NI>Muktakes4i1 (female planet) attacks the child on the
<>seventh night. Bad odour, yawning, weakening of body
<>and cough form the main symptoms of the attack.
<>Exposure to fumes produced by burning leopard's teeth
<>and the smearing of the body with a paste made of
<>orris root and cow's dung and urine should also be
<>done.
<NI>S4ri1dan2d2i1 (female planet) attacks the child on the eighth
<>night. Wandering of the eyes, crying and also making

<HI>GRA1MADEVATA1. India is predominantly a rural
<>country with a number of villages, and the rural folk
<>depend mainly upon agriculture for living. Agricultural
<>land, rain and epidemics which affect them as well as
<>their cattle--these are the main concern of the villagers.
<>Indians, from very ancient days, used to believe that
<>each of the above has its own presiding devata1s. Such
<>devata1s are the gra1madevata1s.
<NI>Devi1 is the chief gra1madevata1 of South India. Devi1 is
<>called Durga1 and Ka1li1 also. But, Devi1 is worshipped in
<>sixtyfour different forms or aspects. The gentle Devi1,
<>viz. in her gentle aspect or attitude has three forms,
<>Kanya1, Ka1ma1ks2i1, and Mu1ka1mbika1. In Kerala Devi1 is
<>called Bhagavati1 also. Valiyan3ga1d2i Bhagavati1 of
<>Calicut is Laks2mi1devi1. Ka1li1 temples in Karn2a1t2aka are
<>called ‘Kot2t2a1puram3 Laks2mi1 Ks2etras’. There are such [Page299-b+ 64]
<>temples in Andhra also. Most of them are Jokula1mbika1
<>temples. In Tamil Nadu there are gra1madevata1s called
<>Mariyamma, Ka1li1yamma, and Draupadi1yamma. Not
<>the Draupadi1 mentioned in the Maha1bha1rata; but the
<>Kan2n2aki1 of Cilappadika1ra is the Devi1 worshipped in
<>Tamil Nadu.
<NI>There are two kinds of Devi1s called Saptama1tr2s and
<>Saptakanya1s. Saptama1tr2s have purus2as (husbands) and
<>saptakanya1s have seven brothers for help and support.
<>Devi1 pu1ja1 is very much prevalent in South India. The
<>custom is supposed to be as old as 5000 B.C. Idols of
<>Devi1 have been unearthed from Mohanjo-daro and
<>Harappa. Even the Buddhists worship the Devi1s called
<>Yaks2i1 and Ha1ri1ti1. When in after years Hinduism was
<>revitalised these gra1madevata1s got promoted as the
<>great Devata1s of the epics and the Pura1n2as. The
<>Ra1ma1yan2a mentions the incident of the Devi1 called
<>Lan3ka1laks2mi1 driving away Hanu1ma1n. There are famous
<>Ka1li1 temples in Ujjayini1 and Calcutta. It is believed
<>that in the temple at Cidambaram also Ka1li1 occupied
<>a prominent place. But, according to legends, S4iva
<>defeated Ka1li1 in a dance competition and ousted her to
<>her present temple at the outskirts of the city. Ca1mun2d2i1
<>is worshipped as the ancestral guardian deity in Mysore.
<>The Ka1ma1ks2i1 temple of Ka1n5ci1, Mi1na1ks2i1 temple of
<>Madura and Mu1ka1mbika1 temple of North Karn2a1t2aka
<>may be cited as examples for the worship of the gentle
<>form of Devi1. Alarmel Man3katta1ya1r temple at
<>Tirucca1nu1r is a very important Devi1 temple. The
<>‘Aditi’ in the Vedas and Kot2t2ravai of Tamil San3gha
<>texts point to the very long past of the Devi1 in India.
<>Ka1lida1sa and Ka1lamegha (a Tamil poet of the
<>fifteenth century have worshipped Ka1li1. S4ri1 Ra1makr2s2n2a
<>Paramaham3sa and the great modern Tamil poet
<>Bha1rati1 were devotees of Ka1li1.
<NI>There are also gra1madevas worshipped like the gra1ma-
<>devata1s. Muni1s4vara and Karuppan are two prominent
<>gra1madevas. In certain villages Bhairava, Vi1ra Irula,
<>Ka1t2t2eri and Non3gi are worshipped as gra1madevas. In
<>South Karn2a1t2aka a set of Devas called Bhu1tas are
<>worshipped, Pan5curuli being one of them. S4a1sta1 or
<>Ayyappa is another gra1madeva. S4a1sta1 is most popular
<>in Kerala and in Tamil Na1d2u. Buddha also is called
<>S4a1sta1. In certain places idols of S4a1sta1 with two wives,
<>called Pu1rn2a1 and Pus2kala1 are also found. S4abarimala
<>S4a1sta1 is yogamu1rti (in yogic pose).
<NI>In most of the gra1madeva temples idols of the Devas
<>are not found. A pi1t2ha (stool-like seat) is supoosed as
<>the seat of the Deva and it represents the Deva also.
<>But, in some temples weapons like the sword, the club
<>etc. are found. Offerings to the deity in gra1maks2etras
<>and annual festivals are common in such temples. (Na1m
<>van2amgum3 daivam3gal-Tamil).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1. A bhu1tagan2a (set of attendants) of S4iva.
<>Sins of those who worship this gan2a will be removed.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 150, Verse 25).
<HI>GRA1MAN2I1YA. One born in the family of the Ks2atriya,
<>who is the governor of village. Nakula defeated the
<>gra1man2i1yas during the conquest of lands in connection
<>with the as4vamedha of Dharmaputra. (Sabha1 Parva;
<>Chapter 32, Verse 9).
<HI>GRANTHIKA. Name assumed by Nakula during his
<>life incognito at the Vira1t2a palace. (Vira1t2a Parva,
<>Chapter 3, Verse 4). [Page300-a+ 65]
<HI>GR2DDHRAKU1T2A. A mountain of northern India. The
<>Lam3s4u1ras gave protection to Br2hadratha at this moun-
<>tain. (S4loka 82, Chapter 49, S4a1nti Parva).

<>74, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRAVAT2A. A mount of the Hima1layas. This
<>mount is the abode of Maha1deva. Those brahmins who
<>visit this place would get moks2a and those of other
<>castes would be absolved of all sins. (S4loka 91, Chapter
<>84, Vana Parva).
<HI>GR2DDHRIKA1. A bird. Kas4yapa begot of his wife
<>Ta1mra1, the six birds namely Ka1ki1, S4yeni1, Bha1si1,
<>Gr2ddhrika1, S4uci and Gri1va1. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter
<>19)
<HI>GREEK LITERATURE. Greek is one of the most
<>important Indo-European languages. As an indepen-
<>dent branch of the original Indo-European language
<>Greek established itself by about 2000 B.C. Even
<>during its earliest period Greek had four local dialects
<>as a result of the arrival of the Greek-speaking people
<>at different periods of time. Iolic, Ionic-Attic, Arcado
<>Cyprean and western Greek are the four dialects.
<>Iolese was prevalent in the Lesbos region, and this is
<>the dialect mainly used in the poetry of Homer. The
<>Ionic and Attic dialects were prevalent in Ionia and
<>Attica respectively. After Homer, the major portion of
<>Greek literature was written in this dialect. The
<>Arcado-Cyprean dialect was used in Arcadio and
<>Cyprus. The fourth dialect was also called Doric.
<NI>Naval traditions, commerce and political power con-
<>tributed to the growth and development of Greek
<>language and literature. In each dialect, even from the
<>very beginning, literary efforts were made. Each of the
<>four spoken languages very soon developed into a
<>written language. But, in the very initial periods each
<>of the spoken dialects continued its existence in the
<>form of ballads and songs transferred from one man to
<>another. It was Homer who gave those popular ballads
<>an epic form and status and sowed the seeds of the
<>great literature of Greece.
<NI>The golden period of Greek literature was when the
<>city of Athens enjoyed supreme political power.
<>Literature during the period set the model for future
<>generations. It was during this period that Greek
<>achieved the best in different literary forms like tragedy,
<>comedy, lyric, elegy, history, philosophy, oratory etc.
<>Pindar, Aeschylus, Herodotus, Sophocles-Euripides,
<>Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and Demosthenes--
<>these are distinguished names who were responsible for
<>the great development of the literary forms referred to
<>above.
<NI>Greek literature passed the Alexandrian, Roman and
<>Byzantian periods before it arrived at the modern
<>period. It was Solomos and Valoritus and others who
<>gave impetus and inspiration to modern Greek litera-
<>ture.
<NI>GR2HADEVI1. Another name of the demoness Jara1.
<>(See under Jara1).
<HI>GR2HAPATI. A sage. There is a story in S4iva Pura1n2a
<>about this sage.
<NI>Vis4va1nara father of Gr2hapati was living with his wife
<>S4ucis2mati1 in a hermitage on the banks of the river
<>Narmada1. They had no children and S4ucis2mati1, was
<>grieved much on this account. She requested her husband
<>find out ways and means to get a child. Vis4va1nara, [Page300-b+ 64]
<>went to Ka1s4i1 and did penance to propitiate Vis4ves4vara
<>and the God appeared before him and blessed him and
<>said: “You will soon get a son”. Very soon the wife
<>of Vis4va1nara delivered a child and the son was named
<>Gr2hapati. When the child was nine years old Na1rada
<>came there once and warned them against fire. Vis4va1-
<>nara immediately went and did penance to propitiate
<>S4iva and obtained from him for his son the qualities of
<>fire also so that fire would be unable to act on him. It
<>was on account of this that Gr2hapati when he installed
<>an idol of S4iva at Ka1s4i1 gave it the name of Agni1s4vara.

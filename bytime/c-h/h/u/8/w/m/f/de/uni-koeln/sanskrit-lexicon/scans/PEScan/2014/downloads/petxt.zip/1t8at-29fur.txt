<HI>LA1T2A. A particular division of the Ks2atriyas. Because
<>a set of the Ks2atriyas showed jealousy towards the

<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>LATA1VES2T2A. A mountain situated on the southern
<>side of Dva1raka1. It had five colours and so resembled
<>the Indraca1pa. (Chapter 33, Da1ks2in2a1tya Pa1t2ha, Sabha1

<HI>LAUHITYA I. A country of Pura1n2ic fame. This
<>country of out-castes was conquered by Bhi1ma and he
<>took from there different kinds of diamonds. (S4loka

<HI>LAVA. A son of Si1ta1. (See under Kus4a II for more
<>details).
<HI>LAVAN2A(M). A hell. (See under Ka1la I).
<HI>LAVAN2A I. A demon. He was the son of a demon

<>Ka1lindi1 was the abode of this demon. This demon was
<>a great oppressor of the Devas and S4atrughna had to kill
<>him S4atrughna then constructed a beautiful city there
<>and lived there. In recognition of the increasing pros-
<>perity of the city it was named Madhura1. After the
<>death of S4atrughna his two sons lived there. (4th
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>LAVAN2A II. A King who was a grandson of Haris4-
<>candra. He once conducted a Ra1jasu1ya in his
<>imagination and became a Can2d2a1la. (story in
<>Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha). This story was narrated to S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>by Vasis2t2ha to teach him the truth that man does not
<>realise that this whole universe is an illusion only
<>because of his ignorance. [Page452-a+ 64]
<>Lavan2a was the King of Uttarapa1n2d2ava, a country of
<>great fame. He was the grandson of Haris4candra and
<>wished to earn fame by performing a Ra1jasu1ya ya1ga
<>as Haris4candra had done. Lavan2a decided to perform
<>the ya1ga in his mind only. He made grand prepara-
<>tions for the yajn5a. He invited the R2tviks and after
<>invoking the devas inflamed the sacrificial fire. For one
<>year he observed ya1ga like that and in the end gave
<>gifts to the brahmins and the poor. It was all an
<>imaginary performance that the King had in the
<>course of a single day when he indulged in a reverie.
<>In the evening as usual he continued his day to day
<>duties.
<NI>One who performs Ra1jasu1ya will have to bear woes and
<>sorrows for a period of twelve years and since Lavan2a
<>had performed it mentally, Indra sent his agent to
<>give Lavan2a worries mentally. Indra's agent appeared
<>in the court of King Lavan2a in the guise of a magician.
<>The magician bowing before the King with awe said,
<>“Lord, I shall show you a magic. See it sitting on
<>your throne. It will be as astounding as if seeing moon
<>rise on the earth”.
<NI>Saying this the magician took a bundle of peacock-
<>feathers and waved it against the face of the King.
<>That bundle was capable of producing different
<>objects and visions. The King fixed his eyes on the
<>several glittering spots on the feathers and soon he
<>saw a relative of the Saindhava King approaching the
<>court. Behind him was a beautiful horse. Holding the
<>horse by the reins the new-comer addressed the
<>King thus. “Lord, this horse is as good as Uccais4s4ravas
<>and it has been sent by the King of Sindhu to be
<>presented to you. Best things should be given to the
<>best people and only then the value of the thing
<>would be correctly understood.” The magician who
<>was standing near-by supported the statement of the
<>new-comer. He said “Lord, what he says is true. This
<>horse has wonderful powers. Take a tour of all the
<>worlds riding on this horse”. The King sat staring at
<>the horse and he sat thus for an hour and a half. The
<>entire court was perplexed.
<NI>After some time the King awoke from his meditation
<>and looking at his courtiers in wonder he said thus:
<>“I shall tell you what happened to me during the
<>short period I was sitting in meditation. While I was
<>looking at the peacock feathers of the magician I felt
<>a desire to go hunting riding on this horse. So I went
<>to the forest alone riding on this horse. Very quickly
<>the horse took me a long distance deviating from the
<>main path and I soon found myself in the dark depths
<>of a huge forest. By the time we reached that forest
<>my mind and body were equally tired and still we
<>went on moving till evening came. Somehow we
<>crossed the forest and reached Ja1n3gala. There I found
<>a cluster of lemon trees and to ease my body I caught
<>hold of a creeper hanging from one of the lemon trees.
<>As I did so, to my horror, I found the horse running
<>away from me and leaving me alone. Tired by the
<>day's travel I sat at a place and dozed. Darkness was
<>creeping in and soon the whole place was in complete
<>darkness. It was very cold also. Somehow I spent the
<>night and when morning came, with hopes I walked
<>around the place. The place was still and no living
<>thing was in sight. As I roamed about I saw a forest- [Page452-b+ 65]
<>girl coming with a pot of rice. I approached her and
<>asked for some rice. She did not pay any attention to
<>my request and moved on. I followed her and she
<>said she would give me rice if I promised to marry
<>her. In despair I agreed to her condition and she was
<>pleased with my reply. She gave me half of the rice
<>and curry she was carrying to her father and also some
<>lemon-juice to drink. After taking that food I rested
<>for a while.
<NI>Her name was Ha1rakeyu1ri1. As soon as her father
<>came from the fields she told him everything. The
<>can2d2a1la was immensely pleased to hear about our
<>marriage and all of us went to their hut. The scene I
<>saw at the hut was astonishing. At one place was the
<>flesh of boars, horses, fowl and crows in a heap and on
<>the intestines of animals hanging from ropes sat birds
<>pecking at them. In the hands of children there were
<>pieces of raw meat and flies hovered round them. The
<>hut presented a disgusting atmosphere and yet I
<>entered and sat on a leaf and my marriage with
<>Ha1rakeyu1ri1 was conducted there. The celebrations of
<>the marriage lasted for seven days and all these days
<>people danced and shouted amidst loud noises of
<>drumming in a hilarious mood of drunkenness.
<NI>Eight months passed by very soon and Ha1rakeyu1ri1
<>became pregnant. She delivered a girl first and soon
<>we had two or three children more. I had to do many
<>cruel and nasty deeds to feed my family and gradually
<>I became old. My hair became grey.
<NI>At that time there occurred a great famine and those
<>residing in the forests were put to great trouble. There
<>was no water to drink as all ponds and lakes went
<>dry. Some of us migrated to the vicinity of the
<>Vindhya mountain where there were plenty of water-
<>fountains. A few committed suicide. We also left the
<>place and started walking, taking the children also
<>along with us. After some time we sat under a palm
<>tree completely exhausted. My wife began to weep
<>profusely. She then kissed her children and lay down
<>and started sleeping. Thirsty and hungry my children
<>lay there awaiting death. Unable to witness the scene
<>I jumped up from there deciding to commit suicide
<>myself. Suddenly my vision faded and I was able to
<>see this court and you all. This is the work of that
<>magician”.
<NI>The courtiers sat dumb-founded at the incredible
<>story of the King. Suddenly the magician disappeared.
<>The magician after making the King experience the
<>woes of twelve years in a very short time left for the
<>court of Indra.
<NI>Next morning King Lavan2a in the hope of seeing the
<>place and people of his dream in reality near the
<>mountain Vindhya started with his retinue on the
<>false pretext that he was going to conduct a victory
<>march When he entered a big forest he met with many
<>familiar places and hunters of his dream. Then he saw
<>the hut where he had lived. The same men and women
<>were there all around. Then the saw an old lady
<>lamenting thus: “Oh my dear sons, where did you go
<>from my lap? My dear daughter, have you forsaken
<>me? Oh prince, you came here abandoning all luxury
<>and the beautiful girls of your palace and married
<>my daughter. But God did not allow even her to be
<>your permanent wife. The river of life has to take
<>worthless and mean paths forced by circumstances. A [Page453-a+ 65]
<>very virtuous King had to come and live with a
<>can2d2a1la girl.”
<NI>Hearing this the King went to her and asked her all de-
<>tails. When she repeated the story the king knew that the
<>lady was the mother of his can2d2a1la wife. The King and
<>ministers were surprised to find that his vision was
<>real and within that short period of his meditation he
<>had lived a life of years. This perplexed the King.
<>He then gave the old lady whatever she wanted and
<>after consoling her started for the palace thinking
<>about the wonderful happenings and mysteries of life.
<HI>LAVAN2A III. A demon who lived in the island of
<>Ra1man2i1yaka. He had come to the island long before
<>the serpents came to that place. The serpents saw
<>him when they went there to live. (S4loka 2, Chapter
<>27, A1di Parva).
<HI>LAVAN2A IV. Another King of the family of Haris4-
<>candra. Yogava1sis2t2ha says that this King had partici-
<>pated in several Ra1jasu1ya yajn5as.
<HI>LA1VA1NAKA (LA1VA1N2AKA). A place of Pura1n2ic
<>fame near the country of Magadha. There are many
<>forests in this place suitable for hunting and so several
<>kings used to come and stay at La1va1naka in times of
<>old.
<HI>LAVAN2A1S4VA. A sage. This sage showed very high
<>respect to Dharmaputra. (S4loka 23, Chapter 26, Vana
<>Parva).
<HI>LAYA. A King of old. He was a member of the court
<>of Yama. (S4loka 21, Chapter 8, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>LEKHA (S). A deva-gan2a (set of celestial beings) of
<>Raivata Manvantara. In this set there are eight Devas
<>named Dhruva, Dhruvaks2iti, Pragha1sa, Pracetas, Br2has-
<>pati, Manojava. Maha1yas4as and Yuvanas. (Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a, 2, 36, 76).
<HI>LIKHITA I. An ancient sage. The King of that land
<>cut off his hands on a charge of theft. But they grew
<>into their original form by the power of the penance of
<>his brother, (Chapter 23, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>It was a time when the celebrated King Sudyumna was
<>ruling over the country. On the banks of the river
<>Ba1huda1 in that country there lived two sages, S4an3kha
<>and Likhita, in two separate hermitages of their own.
<>Once Likhita went to the a1s4rama of his elder brother
<>S4an3kha and finding none but feeling hungry took some
<>vegetables from there and started eating them. While
<>he was eating his brother walked in and he deemed
<>the action of his brother taking the vegetables without
<>his permission as an act of theft. Cutting the hands of
<>the culprit was the punishment accorded by the King
<>at that time to the offender. S4an3kha sent Likhita to the
<>King. The King received the sage respecifully and gave
<>him a seat. The sage then told him all that had happen-
<>ed and then Sudyumna ordered the hands of Likhita to
<>be cut off. Blood was oozing from his hands when
<>Likhita went and bowed before his brother. The brother
<>congratulated him on his accepting the punishment for
<>his crime and asked Likhita to go and take a dip in the
<>Ba1huda1 river. Likhita bathed in that holy river and
<>then he found both the hands growing like lotus-buds
<>from his body. He rushed to his brother and showed
<>him the hands and then S4an3kha said that it was due to
<>the power of his penance that Likhita got his hands.
<>Then Likhita asked his brother why he did not purify
<>him by his power before. S4an3kha replied that the power
<>of punishing was vested in the King and the King [Page453-b+ 63]
<>Sudyumna had become great by executing the law
<>correctly.
<HI>LIKHITA II. An evil-natured priest of Ham3sadhvaja,
<>the King of Campakapuri1. S4an3kha his brother also was
<>the King's priest. Ham3sadhvaja blocked the sacrificial
<>horse of the As4vamedha yajn5a of Dharmaputra and
<>Arjuna attacked the King to get the horse released. To
<>mobilise an army the King announced that each and
<>every soldier should assemble at the place by day-break
<>the next morning and added that those who disobeyed
<>would be put in burning oil.
<NI>By early morning the next day all the soldiers excepting
<>the son of the King arrived at the palace. Sudhanva1,
<>the King's son, was a general of the army and his
<>absence annoyed the King. Ham3sadhvaja was hesitat-
<>ing whether his son should be punished when Likhita
<>advised the King to execute the punishment.
<NI>The King put Sudhanva1 into a big cauldron of boiling
<>oil but Sudhanva1 escaped from it unscathed to the
<>surprise of all. Likhita and S4an3kha said that Sudhanva1
<>escaped because the boiling of the oil was incomplete
<>and uneven. So they boiled the oil again and threw
<>Sudhanva1 into it. At this moment a huge palm tree
<>split into two and fell on them and they were killed.

<HI>LI1LA1VATI1 I. Wife of Dhruvasandhi, King of Kosala.
<>(For details see under Dhruvasandhi)
<HI>LI1LA1VATI1 II. A prostitute who attained Svarga by
<>simply observing the S4ukla1s2t2ami1vrata in the month of
<>Pros2t2hapada in which was born Ra1dha1devi1. Chapter
<>seven, Brahmakhan2d2a of Padma Pura1n2a contains the
<>following story.
<NI>In times of old in Kr2tayuga there was a beautiful
<>prostitute of the name Li1la1vati1. Once she went away
<>from her own town to another in search of better pros-
<>pects. There she saw a big assemblage of people in a
<>temple. They were observing Ra1dha1s2t2ami1vrata and
<>worshipping their deity with scented flowers and incense
<>of sweet fragrance. Some were reciting prayers, some
<>were singing and yet others were dancing. The whole
<>atmosphere was filled with devotion. Li1la1vati1 went to
<>them and enquired about it. They told her that that
<>day was the birthday of Ra1dha1devi1, the S4ukla1s2t2ami1 of
<>the month of Pros2t2hapada, and if anyone observed
<>Vrata on that day worshipping Ra1dha1devi1 he would be
<>absolved of all sins.
<NI>On hearing that, Li1la1vati decided to observe the Vrata.
<>She joined the devotees of the temple and observed the
<>Vrata with great devotion. Soon she died of snake-bite
<>and the servants of Yama came to take her soul to hell
<>because of the sins she had committed as a prostitute.
<>But before the Yamadu1tas could touch her, Pa1rs2adas
<>of Maha1vis2n2u wearing the insignia of S4an3kha, Cakra,
<>Gada1 and Padma came to her with a chariot drawn
<>by kingly swans and took her to heaven.

<HI>LIPI (ALPHABET, SCRIPT).
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} Lipi is the record in writing of the utteran-
<>ces by mouth. There are scientific and non-scientific
<>statements about the origin of lipi. In the beginning
<>people used figures of objects to express their ideas.
<>They were called pictorial writings and are found even
<>now in caves in Spain and France where the aborigines
<>lived. Gradually the pictures vanished and letters took
<>their place.
<NI>2) {%Ancient conception.%} Pura1n2as give a different ver-
<>sion. People of Java believe that the script origi-
<>nated from Java. The voice of Indonesia, a government
<>organ, published once a pura1n2ic story relating to the
<>origin of the script. Lipi came into being in 78 A.D.
<>Ajas4ikha, a saint among the Buddhists, was the originator
<>of the lipi. He had lwo disciples named Dora and
<>Sempa1da1. All the three went and stayed in a village in
<>the valley of the mountains of Kont2an3g. The country
<>of Menra1n3gka1mana1l was then ruled by a King called
<>Baka. Ajas4ikha heard about this wicked King who had
<>ordered one of his subjects to go to him daily for his
<>food. The people were worried. They tried in secret to
<>find out someone to subdue this tyrant. One day they
<>approached Ajas4ikha and requested him to find out a
<>way to get relief from this cruel King. Ajas4ikha sent
<>them back promising to do something to help them.
<NI>Ajas4ikha sat in meditation for some time and then told
<>his disciples thus:-- “I have decided to help the people
<>of Menra1n3gka1mana1l. Dora also should come with me.
<>Sempa1da1 should stay here keeping guard over my
<>sword and clothes. Never give them to anybody but
<>me. You should be prepared to give your life for it.”
<NI>Ajas4ikha and Dora went to see Baka. People discourag-
<>ed them and advised them not to go to the King. But
<>they did not heed that and straight away went to the
<>presence of Baka. Baka started to kill them but then
<>Ajas4ikha said, “Oh King, you can eat me tomorrow.
<>In return please give me today land as big as my
<>headwear”. Baka agreed to that and Ajas4ikha spread
<>his clothes on the ground. As Baka looked with wonder
<>that small piece of headwear began to grow big and it
<>grew in size to cover the whole of the country.
<>Baka got furious at this and attacked Ajas4ikha. But
<>Baka was slain in the duel.
<NI>The people burst into joy and made Ajas4ikha their
<>King. Ajas4ikha then sent Dora to his a1s4rama to fetch
<>his sword and apparels, little thinking of the instructions
<>he had given to Sempa1da1. Dora went and asked for the
<>sword and apparel. But Sempa1da1 did not give and a
<>fight ensued in which both were killed.
<NI>Ajas4ikha felt very sorry when he heard about the death
<>of his disciples. He cursed himself for giving contra-
<>dictory orders to his disciples and so wrote four lines,
<>each containing five letters, to keep alive the memory
<>of his dutiful disciples. Those twenty letters are the
<>first ones written not only in Java but the whole world.
<>They were the following:
<NI>He no co ro ko--There were two disciples.
<NI>T2o to so vo lo--They became enemies because they
<>obeyed the orders of their guru.
<NI>Po dho jo yo n5jo--Both of them were brave men.
<NI>Mo go bo do n3go--Both of them died.
<NI>3) {%Bha1rata lipis.%} Different kinds of lipis were prevalent
<>in ancient Bha1rata. Lalitavistara mentions about sixty- [Page454-b+ 65]
<>four kinds of lipis in Bha1rata during the time of Buddha.
<>From inscriptions on stones and other historical records
<>it can be gathered that the basis of all the lipis had been
<>two main lipis named Bra1hmi1 and Kharos2t2ri1. Kharos2t2ri1
<>was used in the northwest of Bha1rata and became extinct
<>by the 4th Century A.D. Bra1hmi1 was the lipi universally
<>used in Bha1rata. This lipi had different forms in the
<>north and south. The lipi in use in the south was called
<>Dra1vid2i1.
<NI>Kharos2ti1 lipi was written from right to left and the
<>Bra1hmi1 from left to right. Even the Bra1hmi1 was written
<>first from right to left and gradually for the convenience
<>of writing it was changed to one from left to right.
<NI>Linguists consider Bra1hmi1 lipi as the basc of all the
<>lipis of Bha1rata. It underwent changes in different
<>parts and took different names. The scholars of Europe
<>are of opinion that the Bra1hmi1 lipi was borrowed from
<>foreign traders in B.C. 800. Others say that the Bra1hmi1
<>lipi was born out of the pictorial lipi of the Chinese.
<>There are those who say that the Bra1hmi1 lipi originated
<>in Greece and Phoenicia. The great linguist Bulhar
<>says that the Bra1hmi1 lipi came from the Semitic
<>languages. But Lassen and Cunningham refuted it.
<NI>There is a bundle of leaves in the hand of the idol of
<>Brahma1 in the temple of Ba1da1mi. Hindus believe that
<>the Bra1hmi1 lipi found in those leaves was written by
<>Brahma1 himself. The Aryans forgot that lipi and Vya1sa
<>found it out. This is a statement by the Arab traveller
<>Albaru1ni who came to India in the 11th century A.D.
<NI>4) {%Kerala Lipi.%} The Bra1hmi1 lipi came to south India
<>by the 3rd century A.D. Many scholars on languages
<>say that ‘Vet2t2eluttu’ is a changed form of the Bra1hmi1
<>lipi. The great lipi expert L.A. Ravi Varma says that
<>‘Eluttu’ has come from the word ‘Elu’ or ‘Alu’ meaning
<>‘to mark by cuts’. The common method of writing in
<>South India was to use a pointed stick, long metal nail
<>or chisel to make marks on leaves, rocks or copper
<>plates. Writing by making marks with the pointed
<>stick (Kol) got the name ‘Koleluttu’. Vet2t2eluttu,
<>Koleluttu and Malaya1n2ma were the three lipis in use
<>in Kerala. Vet2t2eluttu was in vogue in Tamilna1d2u also.
<>But the Pallavas who were using Pra1kr2ta language when
<>they conquered the northern Tamilnad introduced
<>Grantha1ks2ara and Granthatamil there. T.K.Krishna
<>Menon says that Grantha1ks2ara was a false creation to
<>write Sanskrit easily. In Pa1n2d2yades4a and Malana1d2u
<>Vet2t2eluttu was in use even then.
<NI>The influence of the Pallavas began to wane and the
<>Tamil lipi slowly rose into prominence. Even then
<>Vet2t2eluttu was in vogue in the empire of Cera com-
<>prising of Malana1d2u, Mysore. Coimbatore, Salem and
<>Ton2d2aman2d2alam. When Tamilnadu came under the
<>emperor of Vijayanagara those kings introduced Na1gari1
<>lipi there.
<NI>Vet2t2eluttu was called Na1nam Monam also. In the south
<>instead of using ‘Hari S4ri1’ people used to say ‘Namo-
<>na1ra1yan2a1ya’ and the first syllable ‘Na’ and the second
<>one ‘Mo’ were used to name the language ‘Na1nam
<>Monam’.
<NI>When the Malaya1lis started liking the Man2iprava1la
<>they started using ‘A1rya eluttu’ a form of Granthalipi.
<>This script was known as Tulu-Malaya1lam also. This
<>was also born of the Bra1hmi1lipi. Gradually Vet2t2eluttu
<>and Koleluttu was in use in the north of Kerala among
<>Muslims. The Alphabets now in use by the different [Page455-a+ 65]
<>languages of south India took shape only about two
<>centuries ago. The lipi of Malaya1lam now in use came
<>into shape by the time of Eluttas4s4an spreading the
<>belief that it was Eluttas4s4an who had made the
<>alphabet. It is wise to believe that the Malaya1lam
<>script came into use gradually from A1rya eluttu than to
<>give credit to one individual for its origin.

<>Then there was neither sky nor day nor night. When
<>the time of creation came Prakr2ti entered Vis2n2u as
<>Purus2a creating emotion. From emotion arose Mahat
<>or the Great Principle and from Mahat arose cosmic
<>egoism (Ahan3ka1ra). Ahan3ka1ra divided itself into
<>Vaika1rika, Taijasa and Ta1masa. From Ahan3ka1ra arose
<>A1ka1s4a with the quality of sound and from A1ka1s4a came
<>the air having the quality of touch and from air came
<>fire having the quality of colour and from fire came
<>water having the quality of taste and from water came
<>earth with the quality of smell. All these were born of
<>ta1masic egoism. From taijasic egoism came into being the
<>organs of sense. From the Vaika1rika egoism came the
<>ten Vaika1rika devas and the eleventh organ of sense,
<>the mind. After that Maha1vis2n2u discharged his virility
<>into water and that virility is life. (Chapter 17, Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>(ii) Mahavis2n2u with a view to creating many different
<>kinds of living things created water first and threw his
<>whole energy into it. That energy grew into a golden
<>mass of an egg and Brahma1 was born from that egg.
<>Maha1vis2n2u broke that egg into two, making one half
<>heaven and the other earth. Between the two halves he
<>created the sky. The earth was floating on the waters
<>and he fixed it by anchoring it at ten sides. Then he
<>created Praja1pati, Ka1la, Manas, Va1k, Ka1ma, Krodha
<>and Rati. Then he created thunder, lightning, clouds,
<>rainbows and birds. Then for yajn5asiddhi he created
<>from his face R2gveda, Yajurveda and Sa1maveda. He
<>did sacrifices with them. From his hands he created
<>the different Bhu1tagra1mas and Sanatkuma1ras. He
<>created Rudra out of Krodha. From his mind were
<>born Mari1ci, Atri, An3giras, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu
<>and Vasis2t2ha. He made these seven Brahmars2is. These
<>seven Brahmars2is and Rudra began to create the praja1s.
<>Then Praja1pati divided his body into two. One half of
<>it became man and the other woman. Brahma1 started
<>creation through that woman. (Chapter 18; Agni
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>(iii) In the beginning Maha1vis2n2u in the form of a
<>child lay on a leaf of the Banyan tree. Lying there the
<>Lord began to think like this, “Who am I? Who created
<>me? Why was I created? What should I do here?”
<>At once from the sky came a voice which said:--
<Poem>Sarvam3 khalvidameva1ham3
<>Na1n3yadasti sana1tanam /</Poem>
<>(All these am I. There is nothing eternal except me).
<>The Lord was surprised by the voice and there appear-
<>ed before him Maha1devi1 with four hands bearing the
<>S4an3kha, Cakra, Gada1 and Padma one in each hand.
<>She wore divine garments and ornaments and was accom-
<>panied by Prosperity as her maid. She was surrounded
<>by such forces as Rati Bhu1ti, Buddhi, Mati, Ki1rti, Smr2ti,
<>Dhr2ti, S4raddha1, Medha1, Svadha1, Sva1ha1, Ks2udha1, Nidra1,
<>Daya1, Gati, Tus2t2i, Pus2t2i, Ks2ama1, Lajja1, Jr2mbha1 and
<>Tandri1. Devi1 then addressed Maha1vis2n2u thus: “Why
<>wonder? You have always come into being whenever
<>creation was started by the greatness of great powers. The
<>Supreme Being is without quality of any kind. We are all
<>with quality. You have predominance of Sattvagun2a.
<>From your navel will arise Brahma1 who will be dominat-
<>ed by Rajogun2a and from the centre of the forehead
<>of Brahma1 will be born Rudra with Tamogun2a
<>predominant in him. Brahma1 by the power of his pen- [Page456-a+ 65]
<>ance will acquire the energy to create and he will then
<>create the world. You will be the protector of this
<>world which will in the end be destroyed by Rudra. I
<>am the sa1ttvic power to help you in your work and I
<>am always at your service.”
<NI>Accordingly Brahma1 and Rudra were born and Brahma1
<>started his creation. (1st Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>(iv) In times of old during the great deluge everything
<>in this universe became extinct. It went on like that
<>for some time and then the five elements and Brahma1
<>were born. Brahma1 was born in a lotus. Brahma1
<>decided there should be mud beneath the lotus. He
<>went down through the stem of the lotus and travelled
<>for a thousand years and yet did not find the earth. He
<>came back and sitting inside the lotus started doing
<>penance. After a thousand years Madhu-Kait2abhas
<>rushed to attack Brahma1 (See under Kait2abha).
<NI>Fearing them Brahma1 went under water again. As he
<>went deep down he saw a great man sleeping there. It
<>was Maha1vis2n2u and then only he knew he was sitting
<>on the lotus originating from the navel of Maha1vis2n2u.
<>Maha1vis2n2u killed Madhu Kait2abhas and gave per-
<>mission to start creation and Brahma1 started his work
<>of creation.
<NI>(v) Before the origin of the Universe the shapeless
<>qualityless Para1s4akti permeated everything. From it
<>there were born three powers: Jn5a1nas4akti, Kriya1s4akti
<>and Arthas4akti. The power of Sattvagun2a was Jn5a1na-
<>s4akti, the power of Rajogun2a was Kriya1s4akti and the
<>power of Tamogun2a was Arthas4akti. From the divine
<>power of Ta1masa came the five basic things, sound,
<>colour, touch, taste and smell. The quality of the sky
<>was sound, the quality of air was touch, the quality of
<>fire was colour, the quality of water was taste and the
<>quality of earth was smell.
<NI>Rajogun2a was born of Kriya1s4akti. The five organs of
<>senses, ear, eye, nose, tongue and skin and the five
<>organs of work, hand, leg, speech, organ of excretion
<>and the organ of sex and the five breaths, Pra1n2a, Apa1na,
<>Vya1na, Sama1na and Uda1na are the offsprings of Ra1jasa.
<>These are the forms of Kriya1s4akti. These are controlled
<>by the favourable activity of Cicchakti. The five gods
<>controlling the sense-organs like Va1yu, Su1rya, Pa1s4i1
<>and As4vini1devas and the four gods controlling intelli-
<>gence, conscience etc. like Candra, Brahma1, Rudra,
<>and Ks2etrajn5a and the mind are ten Tattvas (Princi-
<>ples) born of sa1ttvika empowered with Jn5a1nas4akti.
<NI>All the Tattvas were made into five basic elements
<>through the process of Pan5ci1karan2a and the Brahma1n2d2a
<>originated from it.
<NI>2) {%The constitution of Brahma1n2d2a.%} The Brahma1n2d2a is made
<>up of seven Kos4as (coverings). The one in the extreme
<>interior is very small. The second Kos4a originates from
<>the centre of the first Kos4a. The third Kos4a also has
<>its origin from the first one. Each of them envelops
<>the one before it. The seventh Kos4a thus originating
<>from the first Kos4a and bursting forth through the
<>other six Kos4as spreads out for millions of miles around.
<>If you cut the Brahma1n2d2a longitudinally the one in
<>the extreme interior is the earth. Then come Bhuvar-
<>loka, Svarloka, Maharloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, and
<>Satyaloka in succession. The worlds in the lower half
<>are called Pa1ta1la, Rasa1tala, Maha1tala, Tala1tala Sutala,
<>Vitala and Atala. From Satyaloka to Atala there are
<>fourteen lokas. The Brahma1n2d2a consists of the Su1rya, [Page456-b+ 65]
<>Candra, Stars, S4ukra, Budha, An3ga1raka, Br2haspati,
<>S4ani, Saptars2is, Dhruva, S4im3s4uma1ra and Ra1hu, called
<>the Jyotis4cakra. Besides these there are twentyeight
<>hells also. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Am3sa 1).
<NI>Ra1hu is ten thousand yojanas below Su1rya. Ten thou-
<>sand yojanas below Ra1hu is the loka of Siddhavidya1-
<>dharas. Below that up to the path of the clouds is the
<>loka of the demons, genu1 and manes. Hundred yojanas
<>below this is the Bhu1loka (earth). Ten thousand yojanas
<>below the earth and as many yojanas below the world
<>above each are Atala, Vitala Sutala, Tala1tala, Maha1tala
<>Rasa1tala and Pa1ta1la. (5th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Origin of life.%} Brahma1 originated from the navel
<>of Maha1vis2n2u. Brahma1 started creation after obtaining
<>permission from Vis2n2u. In the beginning Brahma1 created
<>from the mind Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha,
<>Kratu, and Pulastya. They are therefore called the
<>Ma1nasaputras of Brahma1. (Manas = mind, Putra, =
<>son). From his wrath came Rudra, from his lap came
<>Na1rada, from his right thumb Daks2a, from his mind
<>Sanaka and others and from his left thumb, Vi1ran2i1.
<>Daks2a married Vi1ran2i1.
<NI>Daks2a got five thousand sons of Vi1ran2i1. They also got
<>sons. When the population began to increase thus
<>Na1rada intervened and questioned the advisability of
<>increasing the population before knowing the capacity of
<>the earth. The sons of Daks2a realised the sense in it
<>and started to have a survey of the earth. Daks2a was
<>disappointed that the children left him without showing
<>any interest in the work of creation. So he produced
<>another five thousand sons and asked them to start the
<>work of creation. But they were also sent away as
<>before by Na1rada. Daks2a became angry and he created
<>sixty daughters.
<NI>He gave thirteen daughters to Kas4yapa, ten to Dharma,
<>twentyseven to Candra, two to Bhr2gu, four to Aris2t2a-
<>nemi, two to Kr2ta1s4va, and two to An3giras. Of these
<>most of the living things in the world were born to
<>Kas4yapa. (7th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>Kas4yapa was the last of the Praja1patis. Kas4yapa
<>married the daughters of Daks2a named Aditi, Diti,
<>Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu, and Anala1.
<>Aditi got thirtythree sons and their family consists of the
<>thirtythree crores of Devas. From Diti were born the
<>daityas or asuras. From Danu was born the da1nava
<>Hayagri1va. Ka1lika1 got two sons, Naraka and Ka1laka.
<>Ta1mra1 got five daughters, Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. Kraun5ci1 gave birth to owls, Bha1si1
<>to Bha1sas and S4yeni to S4yenas (Vultures, Kites etc.).
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 gave birth to Ham3sas, Kalaham3sas and
<>Kokas. S4uki1 gave birth to Nata1 and Na1ta in turn to
<>Vinata1. Krodhavas4a1 gave birth to ten daughters;
<>Mr2gi1, Mr2gamanda1, Hari1, Bhadramada1, Ma1tan3gi1,
<>S4a1rdu1li1, S4veta1, Surabhi, Surasa1 and Kadru1. Of these
<>Mr2gi1 gave birth to beasts, Mrgamanda1 to trees and
<>plants. Lions and monkeys are the children of Hari,
<>Bhadramada1 got a daughter named Ira1vati1. Aira1vata
<>was the son of Ira1vati1. From Ma1tan3gi1 were born the
<>elephants and from S4a1rdu1li1 the tigers. The As2t2adigga-
<>jas are the sons of S4veta1. Surabhi got two daughters
<>named Rohin2i1 and Gandharvi1. Cows are the children
<>of Rohin2i1 and horses are the children of Gandharvi1.
<>Serpents are the sons of Surasa1 and Kadru1 gave birth
<>to snakes. From Manu were born men. Trees are the
<>sons of Anala1. Vinata1 got two sons named Arun2a and [Page457-a+ 63]
<>Garud2a. To Arun2a were born two sons, Jat2a1yu and
<>Sampa1ti.
<NI>4) {%The end of the World%}--There are different views in
<>the Pura1n2as regarding the end of the world. The differ-
<>ent Pura1n2as give different views. For knowing the
<>views of Agni Pura1n2a on the subject see under the
<>heading ‘Pralaya’. The eleventh Skandha of Bha1gavata
<>gives the following theory regarding the end of the
<>world.
<NI>All the material objects of the world will become
<>illusory. Fire will increase. There will be no rains for
<>hundred years together. The World will be burnt by
<>the heat. The heat will go down to the head of Ananta
<>who holds this world on his head. The Saptameghas
<>(Seven Clouds) will rise up in the sunshine infested
<>with the poisonous breath of Ananta. Then rains will
<>start pouring down in streams as thick as the trunk of
<>an elephant. Everything will be drowned in that water.
<>Vis2n2u alone will be left above the vast expanse of
<>water. (See under Manvantara).
<HI>LOKA1LOKA. There is a mountain between Loka and
<>Aloka. This is called Loka1lokaparvata and the land
<>beside it is called Loka1loka. The mountain is as long
<>as the distance between Ma1nasottara and Maha1meru.
<>This place is golden in colour and as smooth as glass.
<>Not a single being lives there. God has created this as
<>a boundary to the three worlds. All the planets like
<>the Sun get light from the brilliance of this mountain.
<>Brahma1 has posted four diggajas named Vr2s2abha,
<>Pus2pacu1d2a, Va1mana and Apara1jita in the four corners
<>of this mountain. (8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<>Jya1magha was sent out from his country and he lived
<>quietly in a hermitage. One day as per the advice of a

<>4, Chapter 7, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>MA1DHAVA II. Son of Vikrama, King of Ta1ladhvaja.
<>The Kriya1 Khan2d2a of Padma Pura1n2a gives the follow-
<>ing story about him.
<NI>Ma1dhava desired to marry a beautiful and good-natur-
<>ed Ks2atriya girl named Candrakala1. She was not [Page459-a+ 65]
<>prepared for that and she informed Ma1dhava thus:
<>“There is a princess in the island of Plaks2a named
<>Sulocana1. She is far more beautiful than myself and
<>is fit to be your consort. Do try to get her.”
<NI>Ma1dhava accepted the advice of Candrakala1 and
<>started for the island of Plaks2a with a servant of his
<>named Praces2t2a. The news that welcomed him when he
<>reached the island was that the marriage of Sulocana1
<>had been fixed with one Vidya1dhara. Undaunted
<>Ma1dhava sent a love-letter to the princess mentioning
<>his arrival in the city, seeking her hand in marriage.
<>In reply to that Sulocana1 wrote that if Ma1dhava appear-
<>ed on the marriage-dais in time she would accept him as
<>her husband.
<NI>The marriage day arrived and Ma1dhava waited for the
<>time of the function. But when the auspicious hour
<>came Ma1dhava was asleep. Praces2t2a, his servant, took
<>advantage of the opportunity and carried away Sulo-
<>cana1. But Sulocana1 was determined to marry only
<>Ma1dhava and she escaped from the custody of Praces2t2a
<>and reached the palace of a King called Sus2en2a and
<>stayed there as a servant wearing the robes of a male,
<>calling himself Vi1ravara.
<NI>Vi1ravara, i. e. Sulocana1 in disguise, saved Vidya1dhara
<>and Praces2t2a from committing suicide. At that time

<>happened and they were happily united as husband and
<>wife.

<>112, A1di Parva). At the time of Arjuna's birth there
<>was a voice from heaven which said, “This child will

<HI>MADYA. Wine. There is a story in the seventh Skandha
<>of Devi1 Bha1gavata showing how Madya happened to be
<>an intoxicant. Once Indra sent out the As4vini1devas
<>from Devaloka and banned wine to them. They took [Page460-b+ 65]
<>refuge in Cyavana a great sage. Cyavana conducted a
<>special Ya1ga and invited the As4vini1devas to partake of
<>the Yajn5a1m3s4a. Indra objected to this and Cyavana had
<>to face Indra in a fight. Then Cyavana produced from
<>the sacrificial fire a demon named Mada and he rushed
<>at Indra to kill him. Indra then bowed down before
<>Cyavana and craved for pardon. Cyavana withdrew
<>the demon and tearing him into four pieces put one
<>each in dice, hunting, wine and women. That was how
<>all the four became intoxicating.
<NI>In ancient India there were certain social conventions
<>regarding drinking of alcoholic preparations. All those
<>drinks which were intoxicants were not listed as
<>‘Alcohol’. Wine, honey, toddy, juice of sugarcane,
<>juice of Iruppa and Kut2ampuli, and sweet toddy of
<>palm tree were not considered alcohol. Sura1 (liquor)
<>chiefly meant Pais2t2i1 (liquor made out of rice paste).
<>Drinking of Sura1 was banned to the three castes, Bra1h-
<>man2a, Ks2atriya and Vais4ya. If they drank Sura1 they
<>had to perform a penance for a year drinking only water
<>or eat long pepper for a year. To be free from the sin of
<>drinking Sura1 one should wear dress made of animal
<>hair. Even if one drinks water in a pot in which Sura1
<>was taken, one should observe Vrata for seven days.
<>(Chapter 173, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>MAGA (S). The brahmins residing in the island of S4a1ka
<>are generally called Magas. The Brahmaparva of Bhavi-
<>s2ya Pura1n2a and the Sa1mba Pura1n2a speak about the
<>Magas thus:
<NI>Sa1mba, son of Kr2s2n2a, did severe penance to please Su1rya-
<>deva and pleased with the unwavering devotion of
<>Sa1mba, Su1rya gave him a luminous replica of himself
<>for worship. Sa1mba constructed a beautiful temple by
<>the side of the Candrabha1ga1 river and installed the idol
<>there. He then brought from S4a1kadvi1pa the brahmins
<>called Magas for conducting the ceremonies of the tem-
<>ple. All the eighteen families of Maga brahmins came
<>and stayed near the temple at the request of Sa1mba.
<HI>MAGADHA. A famous city of ancient India. Its present
<>name is Ra1jagr2ha. The Pura1n2as mention many great
<>Kings who had ruled Magadha. Br2hadratha was once
<>King of Magadha. (S4loka 30, Chapter 63, A1di Parva)
<>Jayatsena one of the Ka1lakeyas was once the King of
<>Magadha. (S4loka 48, Chapter 67, A1di Parva). Pa1n2d2u
<>father of the Pa1n2d2avas once attacked Magadha and
<>Di1rgha the then King of Magadha was killed by Pa1n2d2u.
<>(Chapter 112, A1di Parva). While Br2hadratha was ruling
<>Magadha he passed an order that each and every house
<>should worship the demoness Jara1 as a house-goddess.
<>(S4loka 10, Chapter 13, Sabha1 Parva). During the time
<>of the Maha1bha1rata Jara1sandha was the King of
<>Magadha. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a made Bhi1masena kill Jara1sandha.
<>After his death S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a made Sahadeva brother of
<>Jara1sandha the King of Magadha. (S4loka 43, Chapter
<>24, Sabha1 Parva). Bhi1masena conquered this country
<>during his victory march. The people of Magadha
<>offered gifts to Yudhis2t2hira at his Ra1jasu1ya. (S4loka 18,
<>Chapter 52, Sabha1 Parva). The King of Magadha and
<>the people there fought on the side of the Pa1n2d2avas in
<>the great battle. (S4loka 2, Chapter 53, Udyoga Parva).
<HI>MA1GADHAS. A particular tribe of people. If the work
<>of Su1tas was to drive chariots and the work of Pulkasas
<>to hunt, the work of the Ma1gadhas was that of an
<>adulator. (Chapter 151, Agni Pura1n2a). This work of
<>a flatterer was given to them by Brahma1. When the [Page461-a+ 65]
<>emperor Pr2thu was born, Brahma1 conducted a Ya1ga.
<>On the day of sutya1 at the place of Soma1bhis2ava of the
<>Ya1ga a very intelligent Su1ta was born. At the same ya1ga
<>a Ma1gadha also was born. He was a great scholar. Then
<>the sages told Ma1gadha and Su1ta thus: “Praise this king
<>Pr2thu, who is the valorous son of Vena. Praising is the
<>fittest work suited to you both. Pr2thu deserves praise.”
<NI>Then the Su1ta-Ma1gadhas placing their hands on their
<>breasts with respect said, “What do we know of the
<>qualities and capabilities of a king just born? His fame
<>is not known. Based on what should we sing praises of
<>him?” Hearing this the sages said that they should
<>praise him for the qualities which he would be possess-
<>ing in future. The king was pleased to hear that. Su1ta-
<>Ma1gadhas started singing eulogistic songs based on the
<>qualities and exploits of a Pr2thu to be. Pr2thu then
<>appointed Su1ta as his charioteer and Ma1gadha as his
<>adulator. From then onwards the Su1ta family became
<>charioteers and the Ma1gadha family flatterers. (Chap-
<>ters 13--70 Am3sa 1, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>MA1GADHI1. A river which flows through the middle
<>of five mountains. (Sarga 32, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MAGHA1 I. A sacred place. If one visits this place one
<>would get the benefit of performing the yajn5as like Agni-
<>s2t2oma and Atira1tra. (S4loka 51, Chapter 84, Vana
<>Parva).
<HI>MAGHA1 II. One of the twentyseven constellations. The
<>importance of this constellation is mentioned in the
<>Maha1bha1rata in several places.
<NI>(i) When the planet Kuja (Mars), during its retrograde
<>motion, comes near the constellation of Magha1 many
<>unhappy incidents occur in the world. (S4loka 14,
<>Chapter 3, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<NI>(ii) If Candra stays near Magha1 it is an ill omen. (S4loka
<>2, Chapter 17, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<NI>(iii) If one gives away land in charity on the day of
<>Magha1 one will be rich in children and cattle. (S4loka
<>12, Chapter 64, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(iv) If one gives pudding to the poor on the day of
<>Magha1 which comes in the black half of the month
<>of Tula1 (October) the Manes will be pleased. (S4loka
<>7, Chapter 88, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(v) If one worships the Manes on the day of Magha1
<>sitting in the shade of an elephant, the manes will be
<>satisfied. (S4loka 8, Chapter 88, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(vi) If one conducts the obsequial rites and acts of
<>charity on the day of Magha1 one would become the
<>most excellent member of the family. (S4loka 5. Chapter
<>89, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>MA1GHA. A Sanskrit poet who lived in the 7th Century
<>A.D. The only work of his which has come to light is
<>S4is4upa1lavadha known popularly as Ma1gha.
<Poem>Upama1 Ka1lida1sasya
<>Bha1raverarthagauravam /
<>Dan2d2inah2 padala1lityam3
<>Ma1ghe santi trayo gun2a1h2 //</Poem>
<NI>This is a very famous verse meaning thus: “The simile
<>of Ka1lida1sa, the depth of meaning of the words of
<>Bha1ravi and the simplicity of language of Dan2d2in are all
<>present in Ma1gha”. This indicates how great a poet
<>Ma1gha was.
<NI>From the last part of this Ka1vya it can be surmised
<>that Ma1gha was the son of Dattaka and grandson of
<>Suprabhadeva. Suprabhadeva was the minister of a King [Page461-b+ 64]
<>called Dharmadeva. Ma1gha was born in Gujarat. A
<>literary critic named Jacobi fixes the period of Ma1gha
<>as the 6th century A.D. while others fix it as the 8th
<>century A.D Ma1gha has made references to the drama
<>‘Na1ga1nanda’ written by Hars2a. Hars2a was a King
<>during the period 606 to 649 and that is why the
<>period of Ma1gha is fixed after that period.
<HI>MA1GHA. A month (February). This is so called be-
<>cause it is closely associated with the constellation
<>Magha1. This month is between the months of Paus2a and
<>Pha1lguna. Maha1bha1rata makes some statements about
<>the importance of the month of Ma1gha.
<NI>(i) He who bathes at Praya1ga during this month will
<>be free from all sins. (S4loka 37, Chapter 25, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva).
<NI>(ii) He who gives gingelly as gift to Brahmins during
<>this month will never go to hell. (S4loka 8, Chapter 66,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(iii) If one takes food only once a day during the whole
<>of this month one will be born very rich in the next
<>birth. (S4loka 31, Chapter 106, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(iv) If one worships S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a fasting on the Dva1das4i1
<>day of Ma1gha one will get the benefit of conducting a
<>Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a. (S4loka 5, Chapter 109, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva).
<NI>(v) Bhi1s2ma expressed his desire to Kr2s2n2a to end his
<>life on the as2t2ami1 day falling in the bright fortnight
<>of the month of Ma1gha. (Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter
<>167, S4loka 28).

<>Kubera).

<>Once, while the sun was thus going round, he
<>wished to take a little rest. He asked permission to
<>place the axle of his chariot for a short while on Maha1-
<>meru. The mountain agreed to it. The grateful Sun-
<>god (Su1rya) blessed Maha1meru that it would thence-
<>forth have golden colour. Until it received this blessing,
<>Maha1meru had the colour of ordinary mountains.
<NI>4) {%Other details.%}

<HI>MAHI1RATHA. A King who earned great merit by
<>observing Vrata in the month of Vais4a1kha (May).
<>This King gave to those in hell his one day's pun2ya
<>and all of them were released from hell. [Page465-b+ 65]
<>Mahi1ratha was a King who became prosperous by
<>accrued pun2ya. Kas4yapa was his guru. The King
<>entrusted the affairs of the state to his ministers and
<>led a very immoral life. The country began to decay
<>day by day and one day Kas4yapa gave Dharmopades4a
<>to Mahi1ratha. The Guru said: “Oh King, your body
<>which was in a state of sinning has attained a state of
<>virtue by your association with me. Those well-versed
<>in the Vedas say that the body is of three different
<>kinds. Firstly there is the one which is evil-natured
<>without either virtue or knowledge. Secondly, there is
<>the virtuous one with good conduct. Thirdly, there is
<>the agonising body which hides both virtue and evil.
<>The body without virtue and salvation is always a
<>body of sins. Your body has now become virtuous
<>by becoming devotional to your guru and attending to
<>my words. You are now fit to do virtuous deeds and I
<>shall now make you enjoy the benefits of Vais4a1khasna1na
<>(a bath with religious rites in the month of Vais4a1kha
<>(May).
<NI>After that Kas4yapa made him take the bath and worship
<>with proper Vedic rites in the month of Vais4a1kha. The
<>King became old and died. At once the servants of
<>Ka1la (King of Death) came to fetch the soul of
<>Mahi1ratha. But angels from Maha1vis2n2u came and
<>thrusting aside the agents of Ka1la took charge of the
<>soul of Mahi1ratha. Nymphs from above sang in praise
<>of the King whose sin had waned because of Vais4a1-
<>khapra1tassna1na (early morning bath in the month of
<>Vais4a1kha). The angels from Vis2n2u carrying the soul
<>of the King to Svarga took him through hell. The King
<>heard the agonising cries of those suffering from
<>different kinds of torture in hell. The King made
<>enquiries and feeling compassionate requested those in
<>charge of the hell to release those there in hell then
<>by accepting a portion of the pun2ya acquired by him.
<>The angels agreed to that and the King gave away the
<>Pun2ya he had acquired during one day by observing
<>the Vais4a1khavrata. At once all those in hell were
<>released from the agony and were sent to heaven.
<>(Vais4a1khama1ha1tmyaprakaran2a, Padma Pura1n2a, Pa1ta1la-
<>khan2d2a).
<HI>MAHIS2A. An Asura.
<NI>1). {%Birth.%} Long ago there was a famous Asura King
<>named Danu. Two sons named Rambha and Karam-
<>bha were born to him. Having no issue, they decided
<>to worship Ma1lavat2a yaks2a, praying to be blessed with
<>children. They started tapas, Karambha, in the
<>middle of water and Rambha in the middle of
<>Pan5ca1gni. Indra was alarmed at their tapas. He took
<>the form of a crocodile and went into the water in
<>which Karambha was standing and caught hold of his
<>feet, pulling him down. Karambha was drowned. The
<>mighty Rambha who was enraged at the death of his
<>brother, decided to cut off his own head and offer it
<>as sacrifice in the fire. He drew his sword and was
<>about to cut off his head, when Agni, the god of fire,
<>appeared before him and stopped him saying:--“Do
<>not kill yourself. Killing another person itself is a sin.
<>Suicide is a more serious sin. Ask for any boon you
<>wish to have; I shall grant it. Do not put an end to
<>your life.”
<NI>Then Rambha replied:-- “If you are prepared to
<>grant me a boon, let me have a son who is more
<>brilliant than yourself and who will be the conqueror [Page466-a+ 65]
<>of all the three worlds. He should not be defeated by
<>Devas or Asuras, and he should be as mighty as the
<>wind, handsome and an expert archer.” Agni replied:-
<>“You will have such a son by the woman who wins
<>your heart”.
<NI>When god Agni had left after saying this, Rambha
<>went to visit Ma1layaks2a, who was attended to by
<>Yaks2as. There, they had a treasure known as Padma
<>and numerous animals like elephants, horses, buffaloes,
<>cows and sheep. Among them was a three-year-old she-
<>buffalo of exceptional charm and Rambha fell in love
<>with her. She was also irresistibly attracted by him.
<>As fate would have it, a sexual union took place
<>between them.
<NI>The she-buffalo became pregnant and Rambha took
<>her with him to his own house in Pa1ta1la. There, the
<>other Da1navas, his kinsmen who came to know of his
<>connection with the she-buffalo, expelled him from
<>their midst as one who had committed a forbidden act.
<>So he returned to Ma1lavat2ayaks2a. The pretty she-
<>buffalo accompanied her husband to the holy Yaks2a-
<>man2d2ala.
<NI>While they were living there, she gave birth to an
<>attractive buffalo-calf. After that a he-buffalo came
<>across her. But she remained loyal to her Da1nava
<>husband who drew his sword and rushed towards
<>the he-buffalo. The terrible beast with his mighty
<>horns attacked Rambha who fell dead on the ground.
<>The widowed Mahis2i1 (she-buffalo) sought the protec-
<>tion of the Yaks2as. They saved her from the Mahis2a
<>(He-buffalo). The disappointed and love-stricken
<>Mahis2a drowned himself in a holy lake and was reborn
<>as a mighty and heroic Asura named Namara. The
<>Mahis2i1 spent some time under the protection of the
<>Yaks2as. When they cremated Rambha's body, she
<>jumped into the funeral pyre and burnt herself to
<>death. At once from the middle of the fire there arose
<>a monstrous being. That terrible monster, armed with
<>a sword drove away the Yaks2as and killed all the
<>Mahis2as. Mahis2a who was the son of Rambha alone
<>was spared. He was the Asura named Raktabi1ja. He
<>defeated all gods like Indra, Rudra, Su1rya, Va1yu and
<>others.
<NI>Mahis2a1sura became the King of the Asuras. The
<>alarmed Devas (gods) abandoned their posts of
<>honour. All the worlds were plunged in darkness.
<>(Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 17).
<NI>2) {%Mahis2a1sura's Reign.%} Mahis2a1sura who was intoxi-
<>cated with pride on account of the boon he had
<>received, became the undisputed and sole emperor of
<>the three worlds. He formed a strong council of
<>Ministers. Ciks2ura who was puffed with pride and an
<>expert in military Science, was installed as War-
<>Minister and Ta1mra, the gifted economist as Finance
<>Minister. The Prime Minister was Asiloma1. Bid2a1la
<>was Foreign Minister. Udarka became Military
<>Commander. Ba1s2kala, Trinetra and Ka1labandhaka
<>were assigned the posts of Members of the Executive
<>Council. S4ukra1ca1rya was the Education Minister.
<>Mahis2a strengthened his army. The State Treasury
<>overflowed with wealth. Kings of the neighbouring
<>states paid tribute and bowed their heads to him. The
<>Bra1hman2as offered the share of yajn5a to Mahis2a1sura
<>and prostrated before him. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th
<>Skandha). [Page466-b+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Outbreak of War.%} After strengthening his position
<>as Emperor of the world, Mahis2a contemplated the
<>conquest of Heaven. He sent a messenger to Indra.
<>The messenger ordered Indra to surrender to Mahis2a1-
<>sura. Indra answered with utter contempt to the
<>messenger and his master Mahis2a. The messenger
<>returned and reported the matter to Mahis2a1sura who
<>began to tremble with anger.
<NI>Although Indra sent away the messenger with scorn,
<>he had no peace of mind. He called together the
<>Devas and discussed what was to be done. They decid-
<>ed to declare war on Mahis2a1sura. Brahma1 and Indra,
<>accompanied by the other Devas set out to Kaila1sa.
<>From there, taking Paramas4iva with them, they
<>proceeded to Vaikun2t2ha. On arrival there, they offered
<>prayers to Maha1vis2n2u who appeared before them.
<>They submitted to him their grievances and sufferings
<>under the rule of Mahis2a1sura. After deep deliberations,
<>Maha1vis2n2u supported the proposal for war. Thus the
<>war between Devas and Asuras started.
<NI>4) {%Deva1sura Yuddha.%} It was a dreadful war. Mahis2a
<>himself appeared on the scene of battle. He struck at
<>Indra with his mighty club. Before he received the
<>blow, Indra broke the club with his Thunderbolt. The
<>Asura named Andhaka encountered Maha1vis2n2u. The
<>five arrows of that Asura were broken to pieces by
<>Maha1vis2n2u in the sky itself. Then they started a
<>terrible fight with various weapons such as sword,
<>spear, axe, arrow, discus etc. It lasted for about 50
<>days without a break. Ba1s2kala fought against Indra,
<>Mahis2a against Rudra, Trinetra against Yamadharma,
<>Maha1hanu against S4ri1da, and Asiloma1 against Pracetas.
<>In the course of the battle, Andhaka, struck a blow at
<>Garud2a with his cudgel. Garud2a, the vehicle of Vis2n2u
<>was stunned by the blow, but Vis2n2u restored his energy
<>by stroking him gently with his right hand. After that
<>he took up his bow S4a1rn3ga and tried to kill Andhaka
<>with a shower of arrows. But the Daitya warrior
<>countered all of them with 50 arrows which he shot at
<>Vis2n2u. Vis2n2u smashed all of them and sent his
<>destructive weapon “Sudars4ana Cakra” against
<>Andhaka. Without the slightest fear, Andhaka stopped
<>it with his own Cakra weapon and kept Vis2n2u's
<>weapon at bay and shouted in triumph. Finding that
<>Vis2n2u's weapon had failed and hearing the scornful
<>shout of Andhaka, the Devas were filled with panic.
<>At this critical moment, Vis2n2u took up his club
<>“Kaumodaki1” and rushed into the midst of the Asuras
<>and struck Andhaka with it. Under the blow, the
<>Asura hero reeled and fell down unconscious. At his
<>fall, Mahis2a himself rushed forward to Vis2n2u with a
<>terrible roar. Then there ensued a bitter fight between
<>Vis2n2u and Mahis2a. Each began a shower of arrows
<>on the other. But not a single arrow injured either.
<>In the thick of the battle Vis2n2u struck a blow on
<>Mahis2a's head and he dropped down unconscious.
<>But ere long the Da1nava rose up and taking up his iron
<>pestle aimed a mighty blow at Vis2n2u's head and
<>brought it down with deadly effect Under the blow,
<>even Vis2n2u fell unconscious on Garud2a's back. Vis2n2u's
<>condition made Garud2a withdraw from the scene of
<>battle temporarily, with Vis2n2u on his back. Indra and
<>the other gods began to cry aloud. S4iva, who saw this
<>desperate plight of the Devas, at once came to the
<>battlefield, carrying his trident, ready to fight against [Page467-a+ 65]
<>Mahis2a. When he tried to pierce the Asura's chest
<>with his trident, the latter thwarted the blow with his
<>own lance and aimed it at S4iva's breast. Although it
<>actually hit him, S4iva disregarded it and gave another
<>thrust to Mahis2a with his trident. By this time Maha1-
<>vis2n2u had recovered from his swoon. At once he return-
<>ed to the field of battle and joined S4iva in his attack on
<>Mahis2a. When Mahis2a saw that both S4iva and Vis2n2u
<>were launching a combined attack against him, in his
<>wild fury he assumed his own buffalo form and lifting
<>up his tail and shaking his head rushed towards his
<>mighty adversaries. With his terrible horns he lifted
<>up mountain peaks and hurled them at the enemy.
<>But the Deva leaders stopped them with their shower
<>of arrows. Vis2n2u sent his Cakra against him and it
<>made the Asura chief drop down senseless. But he
<>soon recovered and rushed forward to renew his attack
<>with a terrible roar. Vis2n2u then sounded his divine
<>conch “Pa1n5cajanya” and drowned the sound of his
<>roar. Just as the roaring of the asura frightened the
<>Devas, the sound of Pa1n5cajanya struck terror in the
<>minds of the Asuras.
<NI>5) {%Mahis2a's Death.%} The Asuras were terrified at the
<>sound of Pa1n5cajanya. In order to encourage them,
<>Mahis2a assumed the form of a lion and rushed into
<>the midst of the army of Devas roaring. Even the
<>Trimu1rtis were alarmed for a short while when they
<>saw the fierce beast advancing through their battle-
<>array killing and mauling hundreds of the Devas on
<>either side. Maha1vis2n2u at once sent his weapon Cakra
<>against the lion. The lion was reduced to ashes by it,
<>but Mahis2a rose up again in the form of a buffalo and
<>rushed forward. He gave a severe cut on Maha1vis2n2u's
<>chest with his long and powerful horn. Maha1vis2n2u
<>started fleeing to Vaikun2t2ha. At the sight of this, S4iva
<>concluded that Mahis2a was proof against killing and
<>so he also fled to Kaila1sa riding on his bull. When
<>Vis2n2u and S4iva took to their heels, Brahma1 also flew to
<>Satyaloka, riding on this swan. Although the leaders
<>left the field, the rest of the Devas under the leadership
<>of Indra, encountered Mahis2a again. Indra drew his
<>Vajra. The As2t2adikpa1lakas assisted him. The battle
<>raged fiercely again. The Devas began to flee for life.
<>Taking this opportunity, Mahis2a1sura forced his way
<>into Heaven. He planted his Daitya flag highly. He
<>drove out all the remaining Devas. In this way the
<>Asuras took possession of Devaloka. The Devas took
<>shelter on the tops of mountains.
<NI>Several centuries passed. The Devas assembled and
<>prayed to Brahma1. He took them again to Vaikun2t2ha.
<>S4iva also arrived there. The Devas submitted their
<>grievances to Vis2n2u. They prayed to him to devise
<>some method by which Mahis2a could be killed.
<>Brahma1 had given him a boon that no Man was
<>capable of killing him.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u said to them:--“By Virtue of the boon,
<>Mahis2a could be killed only by a woman. If we can
<>create a woman who is part of the Devas with their
<>power and glory, we could kill him with her help. So
<>let us try to create such a mighty woman, concentrating
<>all our powers on her. After her creation, we must
<>give her all our weapons.”
<NI>As soon as Maha1vis2n2u spoke these words, a figure with
<>dazzling effulgence issued forth from Brahma1's face.
<>Both Vis2n2u and S4iva were amazed at the sight of this [Page467-b+ 64]
<>figure radiating beams of light which were partly cool
<>and partly warm. Similar figures, embodying the
<>peculiar powers and qualities of Vis2n2u, S4iva, Indra,
<>Kubera, Varun2a and all other gods, emanated from
<>them. In a moment all these figures merged into a
<>single figure and transformed themselves into a single
<>woman with celestial beauty and having eighteen arms.
<>This woman of exquisite beauty combining all the
<>powers and glories of all the Devas was Devi1 herself.
<>The devas supplied her with jewels and ornaments and
<>gorgeous clothes. Decked in all glory and with fasci-
<>nating beauty, riding on a lion. she took her stand at
<>the entrance of Devaloka and challenged Mahis2a. At
<>the very first sight of Devi1, Mahis2a fell in love with
<>her. She declared she would become the wife of the
<>person who could defeat her in battle.
<NI>So Mahis2a made up his mind to defeat her in a fight.
<>It was a terrible battle. All the Ministers of Mahis2a,
<>like Ba1s2kala, Durmukha, Ta1mra, Ciks2ura, Asiloma1
<>and Bid2a1la were slain. At last Mahis2a himself appeared
<>on the scene to fight with Devi1. Mahis2a started with
<>a shower of arrows and Devi1 countered them all with
<>her own arrows. In the end she attacked him with
<>Vis2n2u Cakra. The Cakra cut off his throat and he
<>dropped down dead. The devas raised a thunderous
<>shout of joy and triumph. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th
<>Skandha).

<NI>1) {%General information.%} A mountain. This mountain was
<>the son of Himava1n and father of Kraun5ca. (S4loka 13,
<>Chapter 18, Harivam3s4a).
<NI>2) {%How the mountain helped Hanu1ma1n.%} There is an
<>unbreakable tie between Maina1ka and the Kings of
<>Iks2va1ku family. There is a story in Brahma1n2d2a
<>Pura1n2a that the sa1gara (ocean) was constructed by the
<>sixty thousand sons of the King Sagara of Iks2va1ku
<>family. This sa1gara once gave refuge to Maina1ka and
<>brought it up. There is a reason for that:-- [Page468-b+ 64]
<>In the early yugas mountains had wings and they used
<>to fly and drop to the ground as they liked. People
<>used to live in fright always and at the request of the
<>people Indra made the mountains stand in a row and
<>cut off their wings. At that time the god Va1yu (wind)
<>took away his friend Maina1ka and put him in the
<>ocean. From that day onwards Maina1ka and the
<>ocean developed an intimacy which even death could
<>not wipe off. Hanu1ma1n was the son of Va1yu, the
<>friend and saviour of Maina1ka. It was because of that
<>that Maina1ka gave refuge for Hanu1ma1n on his way to
<>Lan3ka1. Because the ocean gave refuge to Maina1ka
<>after its escape from the sword of Indra and because
<>the ocean (Sa1gara) was the creation of the sons of
<>Sagara, a King of the Iks2va1ku race, Maina1ka felt
<>indebted to Sagara and the entire race to which he
<>belonged. Maina1ka thus had great respect for S4ri1
<>Ra1ma who belonged to the Iks2va1ku race. This was
<>also responsible for Maina1ka giving relief to Hanu1ma1n
<>on his way to Lan3ka1. (See under Parvata).

<NI>(ii) Mainda was the minister of Sugri1va, King of the
<>monkeys. He was mighty, intelligent, and kind to
<>others. (S4loka 23, Chapter 28, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iii) Mainda was one of the leaders who led the

<NI>(iv) In the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle Mainda and others

<HI>MAITRA I. A demon tribe. Once a sage named
<>Lomas4a persuaded Dharmaputra to attack this tribe.

<>Maitramuhu1rta. (S4loka 6, Chapter 83, Udyoga
<>Parva). [Page469-a+ 64]
<HI>MAITRA III. A constellation. Kr2tavarma1 joined the
<>Kaurava side on the day of this constellation. (S4loka
<>14, Chapter 35, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MAITRA1VARUN2A. Another name for Vasis2t2ha.
<>Agastya also is known by this name. Because they were
<>born as the sons of Mitra and Varun2a they got this
<>name. How they came to be reborn as the sons of
<>Mitra1varun2as is told in Devi1 Bha1gavata.
<NI>There was once a celebrated emperor named Nimi in
<>the Iks2va1ku line of Kings. Nimi was the twelfth son
<>of Iks2va1ku. The agraha1ra found near the a1s4rama of
<>Gautama Mahars2i, called Jayantapura was constructed
<>by Nimi. Once Nimi decided to perform a big ya1ga
<>and after taking the consent of his father made pre-
<>parations for the same. He invited such great sages
<>as Bhr2gu, An3giras, Va1madeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and
<>R2ci1ka. He then went to their family preceptor Vasis2t2ha
<>and requested him to be the chief priest. But Vasis2t2ha
<>had already promised Indra to conduct a ya1ga for him
<>and so advised Nimi to postpone his ya1ga to a later
<>date. But Nimi was unwilling to postpone his ya1ga and
<>so he performed it with Gautama Mahars2i as the
<>chief priest. It took five hundred years for Nimi to
<>complete the ya1ga. After five hundred years Vasis2t2ha
<>after completing the ya1ga of Indra came to see Nimi
<>and found that he had already conducted the ya1ga
<>without him. Vasis2t2ha was angry and he cursed Nimi
<>saying that Nimi would become bodiless. But powerful
<>Nimi cursed Vasis2t2ha also and separated his soul from
<>his body.
<NI>Griefstricken, Vasis2t2ha went to Brahma1 and com-
<>plained to him. Brahma1 said, “Oh son, you go and
<>merge with the brilliance of Mitra1varun2as and stay
<>there. After some time you will be able to be born
<>without being in a womb; you will then have a memory
<>of the past and you will be very learned and will be
<>worshipped by all”.
<NI>Vasis2t2ha was pleased to hear that and he circumam-
<>bulated Brahma1 and prostrated before him and then
<>went to the a1s4rama of Mitra1varun2as. He then
<>abandoned his body there and merged with the
<>brilliance of Mitra1varun2as. One day Urvas4i1 with
<>her companions came to the a1s4rama of Mitra1varun2as
<>and attracted by her charm they spent a night with
<>her. Their semen at one time fell into a jar nearby
<>and from it were born two people, Agastya and
<>Vasis2t2ha, (Skandha 6, Devi1 Bha1gavata).

<NI>2) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Once Maitreya went to Hastina1pura and told
<>Duryodhana that he should behave kindly to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. Duryodhana who did not much relish the
<>advice sat tapping on his thighs with his hands, not
<>seriously attending to the sage. Maitreya was dis-
<>pleased at the discourtesy and cursed that Bhi1ma [Page469-b+ 65]
<>would one day break Duryodhana's thighs. (See under
<>Duryodhana).
<NI>(ii) Maitreya was a courtier of Yudhis2t2hira. (S4loka

<>(S4loka 6, Chapter 43, S4a1nti Parva).
<NI>(iv) Once he discussed with Vya1sa topics on Dharma.
<>(Chapter 120, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<NI>(v) When Sri1 Kr2s2n2a died, the spiritualistic ideology of
<>Dharmaputra became more dominant and he approach-
<>ed Vidura for Dharmopades4a. Vidura sent him to
<>Maitreya. Dharmaputra went to the A1s4rama of
<>Maitreya on the banks of the river Gan3ga1 and after
<>paying respects to him accepted Dharmopades4a
<>(Instruction in law, duty and morals) from him. (3rd
<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>MAITREYI1. Wife of the sage Ya1jn5avalkya. She was

<HI>MAITRI1. Daughter of Daks2a. Thirteen daughters of

<>deva. (4th Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>MAJJANA. A soldier of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 70, Chap-
<>ter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MA1KANDI1. A city of the King Drupada. This city was
<>on the banks of the river Gan3ga1. (S4loka 73, Chapter
<>137. A1di Parva). See under KAPAT2ABHIKS2U.
<HI>MAKARADAM3S2T2RA1. A prostitute of Mathura1, the birth
<>place of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. The story of this woman who had
<>made prostitution and cheating her aim in life was told
<>to Va1savadatta1 wife of Udayana by Vasantaka. The
<>curbing of the arrogance of Makaradam3s2t2ra1 by a poor
<>brahmin of name Lohajan3gha with the help of Vibhi1s2an2a,
<>emperor of the demons, is the theme of the story.
<NI>Makaradam3s2t2ra1 had a daughter named Ru1pin2ika1.
<>The mother tried to make the daughter also a prostitute.
<>Once Ru1pin2ika1 went to a far-off temple for worship as
<>instructed by her mother. There she met a poor brahmin
<>named Lohajan3gha and Ru1pin2ika1 was attracted to
<>him by his handsome features. She sent word through
<>her maid requesting Lohajan3gha to come to her house.
<>Ru1pin2ika1 came back and waited for her lover to come.
<>After some time Lohajan3gha came. Makaradam3s2t2ra1
<>scrutinised the new-comer with suspicion but Ru1pin2ika1
<>took him to her bed-room. Both of them remained
<>there making love. Makaradam3s2t2ra1 finding her daugh-
<>ter going against the principles of a prostitute called her
<>to her side and said: “Dear daughter, why do you keep
<>this poor brahmin? Is this the duty of a prostitute?
<>Love and prostitution never go together. We are like
<>dusk. The twilight of love remains for a few seconds
<>only. So do send away this brahmin who has no
<>money.”
<NI>Ru1pin2ika1 discarded the advice of her mother and
<>Makaradam3s2t2ra1 felt annoyed. She decided to send out
<>Lohajan3gha somehow. One day a prince came that
<>way and Makaradam3s2t2ra1 enticed him to her house and
<>requested the prince to accept Ru1pin2ika1 and send
<>Lohajan3gha out of her house.
<NI>The prince accepted the request of the mother-prosti-
<>tute. At that time Ru1pin2ika1 had gone to the temple [Page470-a+ 65]
<>and Lohajan3gha for a walk. After some time Lohajan3gha
<>came as usual and entered the house. and Makara-
<>dam3s2t2ra1 introduced Lohajan3gha to the prince. At once
<>the servants of the prince beat Lohajan3gha and carrying
<>him away out of the house put him in an excrement pit.
<>Lohajan3gha somehow escaped from there and ran away.
<>He was sorry to part with his love and he went on a
<>pilgrimage. He walked for a long distance in the hot
<>sun and feeling tired searched for a shady place to take
<>some rest. Then he saw the carcass of an elephant.
<>Jackals entering through the buttocks had eaten all
<>flesh and the animal lay hollow inside with the skin in
<>tact on the skeleton. Lohajan3gha entered the inside
<>of the elephant and slept there. That night it rained
<>heavily and the hole at the buttocks contracted with
<>little space for Lohajan3gha to get out. The rains continu-
<>ed, the water-level in the river Gan3ga1 rose and soon
<>the carcass of the elephant was carried away to the
<>river and it gradually reached the ocean. At that time
<>a great kite taking it to be flesh for food drew it up and
<>took it to the other side of the ocean. When it pecked
<>it open it found a man inside and frightened
<>left it there and flew away. By this time Lohajan3gha
<>awoke from his slumber and while he was looking
<>around him in surprise he saw two demons approaching
<>him. The demons thought he had come to the place
<>crossing the ocean like S4ri1 Ra1ma to bring disaster
<>to them and so they immediately ran up to Vibhi1s2an2a
<>and told him of the incident. Vibhi1s2an2a asked his ser-
<>vants to bring Lohajan3gha before him and when he
<>was brought before him enquired very politely who he
<>was and why he had come there and how he had come.
<>In reply to the enquiries Lohajan3gha said thus: “I am
<>a brahmin from Mathura1. I did penance to please
<>Vis2n2u to get relief from my poverty and one day Vis2n2u
<>appeared before me in person and said, ‘Go to my
<>devotee Vibhi1s2an2a, and he will give you enough wealth
<>to live happily’. It was in a dream and when I awoke
<>I found myself on this shore. I do not know how it all
<>happened.”
<NI>Vibh2i1s2an2a was immensely pleased to hear the story of
<>Lohajan3gha and gave him immense wealth including
<>many precious diamonds, golden replica of the emblem
<>of Vis2n2u consisting of S4an3kha, Cakra, Gada1 and
<>Padma and a small kite from the mountain of Svarn2a-
<>mu1la. Accepting all these Lohajan3gha flew on the back of
<>the kite back to Mathura1 and alighted at a deserted place
<>there. Keeping all his valuable articles in a secret place
<>he took one diamond and selling it acquired some cash
<>and with that purchased some ornamental dress for
<>himself. At dusk he dressed himself and holding the
<>emblem of Vis2n2u flew on the back of the kite to the
<>house of Ru1pin2ika1 and addressing Ru1pin2ika1 in private
<>said, “I am Vis2n2u. I have come to you for a
<>union because you are virtuous”. Hearing that Ru1pin2ika1
<>respectully surrendered herself to him. Before dawn
<>Lohajan3gha left the house and flew back to the desert-
<>ed place. Ru1pin2ika1 felt herself to be a goddess and
<>did not speak to anybody in the morning. The mother
<>was perplexed to find her daughter observing a vow of
<>silence and questioned her. Ru1pin2ika1 then told her
<>mother all that had happened on the previous night.
<>Makaradam3s2t2ra1 wanted to confirm the story of her
<>daughter and so she kept awake that night to see what
<>took place. She found Lohajan3gha arriving as Vis2n2u [Page470-b+ 65]
<>on the back of Garud2a and fully believing him to be
<>Maha1vis2n2u was overjoyed at the fortune of her daughter
<>and running to her the next morning said “Oh,
<>dear daughter, by the grace of S4ri1 Na1ra1yan2a you
<>have become a goddess. How fortunate am I? You
<>should do one thing for me. You must send me to
<>heaven with this body of mine along with your husband-
<>god.”
<NI>Ru1pin2ika1 agreed to do so. That night she told the fake
<>Vis2n2u the desire of her mother. Then Lohajan3gha said:
<>“Your mother who is a great sinner is not eligible to go
<>to Svarga in her present state. Day after tomorrow
<>on the Dva1das4i1 day the gates of heaven will open.
<>Early morning on that day the goblins of S4iva would
<>enter Svarga. I shall then try to send your mother
<>along with them. But your mother should then appear
<>as a goblin. The hair on the head should be shaved at
<>five places and the remaining hair locked to form five
<>tufts of hair. She should wear a garland of bones and
<>the body should be painted black on one side with char-
<>coal and red on the other side with saffron. The painting
<>should be in oil and she should not wear any clothes.
<>This would make her appear like a goblin of Mahes4vara
<>(S4iva) and then there will be no difficulty for me to allow
<>her to enter Svarga.
<NI>Lohajan3gha left the place early in the morning and
<>Ru1pin2ika1 told her mother all that her husband told
<>her. Makaradam3s2t2ra1 dressed herself as instructed by
<>Lohajan3gha and awaited the arrival of the fake Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. Lohajan3gha came at night and Ru1pin2ika1
<>showed him her mother dressed as desired by her
<>husband. Lohajan3gha took Makaradam3s2t2ra1 on the
<>back of his kite and flew up. As he rose high he saw a
<>tall flagstaff of a temple nearby. It had a wheel on its
<>top. Lohajan3gha placed her on the wheel and said,
<>“Do sit here for a while. I shall soon come back to
<>you and bless you”. To the people assembled in
<>the temple he spoke from the air, “Citizens, today the
<>goddess ‘Ma1ri1’, destroyer of everything, will fall on
<>you. If you want to avoid that, remain in this
<>temple and worship Vis2n2u”.
<NI>People were frightened when they heard the warning
<>from air and all remained in the temple chanting pra-
<>yers and reciting devotional songs about Vis2n2u. Makara-
<>dam3s2t2ra1 sat there for a while dreaming about the hap-
<>piness in store for her in Svarga and awaiting her
<>daughter's husband to come and take her. But Loha-
<>jan3gha had come to the temple in an ordinary dress
<>and was with the crowd in the temple. Time dragged
<>on and it became midnight and Makaradam3s2t2ra1 sitting
<>on the wheel of the flagstaff felt uneasy. She could not
<>sit there any longer and she cried aloud, “Oh, I am fal-
<>ling”. People mistook her for Ma1ri1 and cried back, “Oh,
<>goddess, do not fall”. It became morning and in the
<>sunlight they saw a figure sitting on the top of the flag-
<>staff and were surprised. The King was informed and he
<>came to the temple and so also all people from the place.
<>When the people on scrutinising the figure knew it was
<>Makaradam3s2t2ra1, they all clapped their hands laughing
<>loudly. Hearing the news Ru1pin2ika1 also came to the
<>temple and she somehow got her mother down from the
<>flagstaff. The King then made the prostitute tell her story
<>and when it was finished he declared thus: “Who has
<>thus played fraud on this prostitute who had throughout
<>her life cheated other people? If he comes before me [Page471-a+ 64]
<>now I will give him my crown and Kingdom”. Hearing
<>that Lohajan3gha appeared before the King and con-
<>fessed that he had done the mischief. He then narrated
<>his story to the king and placed before the king the
<>golden Seal of Visnu's emblem which Vibhi1s2an2a had
<>given him. The king as per his promise gave Loha-
<>jan3gha his kingdom and Ru1pin2ika1 once more became
<>his. The arrogance of Makaradam3s2t2r2a1 was thus curbed.

<>But the King did not heed the advice of his son. He
<>jokingly said that Induprabha was also their “Kalpa-

<>oath that he would either become a “Kalpavr2ks2a” or
<>lay down his life in the attempt. He left the palace at
<>once and began an austere tapas. Indra was pleased and
<>appeared before him. Receiving his blessing, Induprabha
<>returned to his capital and stood there as a “Kalpa-

<>later, Indra came to the tree to test Induprabha. He
<>told Induprabha: “Your mission of service is over; now
<>you may come to Heaven”. But he insisted that his
<>subjects also should be taken with him to Heaven. Indra
<>was pleased at the devotion and love of Induprabha for
<>his subjects and agreed to take all his subjects also with
<>him. Induprabha gave up the form of the tree and

<>He said, “There is a mountain named Triku1t2a on the
<>shores of the southern sea. There is a mountain on it
<>called Subala. Its main top grazes the sky. Its four
<>sides have been beautifully chiselled. No birds fly to its
<>top. I have constructed there at the request of Indra
<>a beautiful city surrounded by walls of gold and adorned

<>Lan3ka1 and you, demon-lords, can stay there. You will
<>get glory and prestige which even Indra could not
<>acquire in his Amara1vati1. If you live in Lan3ka1 with
<>your followers you will be unconquerable”.
<NI>The happy demons with their people went to Lan3ka1.
<>They married the daughters of a Gandharva woman

<NI>1) {%Curse of Ma1lyava1n.%} Once S4iva was telling Pa1rvati1 a

<>sat hiding in a place nearby. Pa1rvati1 got angry and
<>was about to curse when Ma1lyava1n intervened and re-
<>commended for mercy. Pa1rvati1 got angrier and cursed
<>them both to be born on earth as men. They begged
<>for relief and Pa1rvati1 said: “In the deep depths of the
<>forest of Vindhya mountains there lives a Yaks2a named
<>Suprati1ka who has been turned into a devil called
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti by a curse. Pus2padanta should narrate the
<>story he has now heard to Ka1n2abhu1ti and he will then
<>be released from the curse. Ka1n2abhu1ti would narrate to
<>Ma1lyava1n what he has heard from Pus2padanta and [Page473-a+ 65]
<>Ka1n2abhu1ti would then be released from his curse.
<>Ma1lyava1n should then make public the story he has
<>heard and then he will also be released from the curse”.
<>Pus2padanta was born as Vararuci in the city of Kau-
<>s4a1mbi1 and Ma1lyava1n as Gun2a1d2hya in the city of
<>Supratis2t2hita. (See under Gun2a1d2hya).
<NI>2) {%Another curse to Ma1lyava1n.%} By another curse Ma1lya-
<>va1n was born as a spider and Pus2padanta as an elephant

<>reached the presence of S4iva. It was the time of the
<>Deva1sura battle and Ma1lyava1n fought on the side of
<>the devas. Ma1lyava1n played a prominent part in the
<>battle. Ma1lyava1n had to fight against a fierce archer
<>named Kola1hala. Kola1hala sent three arrows one each
<>on the forehead and the two shoulders. Ma1lyava1n
<>returned the fight with arrows. Then Kola1hala showing
<>his swiftness of hand tormented him with several
<>different weapons. Unmindful of this vehement attack
<>Ma1lyava1n plucked a hillock and threw it at Kola1hala.
<NI>Then suddenly a fierce figure blazing with fire having
<>nine pairs of hands and feet and three heads looking
<>yellow in colour jumped out of the demon and made
<>Ma1lyava1n faint by the terrible heat it gave out.
<>Ma1lyava1n accepted defeat and ran away to the mountain.
<>(Chapter 13, Part 4, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>MA1LYAVA1N II. Son of the demon Sukes4a. He was the
<>brother of Ma1li1 and Suma1li1.
<NI>This Ma1lyava1n was the father of Ra1van2a's mother.
<>They were all living in Pa1ta1la but when Ra1van2a
<>obtained his boon he sent away Kubera from Lan3ka1
<>and became the ruler of Lan3ka1. Ma1lyava1n and other
<>demons followed Ra1van2a to Lan3ka1 and stayed with him
<>confirming his sovereignty over the place.
<NI>In the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a battle Sugri1va stole the crown of
<>Ra1van2a and kicked him on his face. Ashamed of the
<>insult Ra1van2a went back to his palace and the first per-
<>son he saw was Ma1lyava1n. The old man had come to
<>advise Ra1van2a to give back Si1ta1 to S4ri1 Ra1ma. But
<>Ra1van2a did not like the advice and tore to pieces the
<>letter of advice. (For more details see under Ma1li1).
<HI>MA1LYAVA1N III. A mountain. This mountain is situ-
<>ated between the mountains of Meru and Mandara in
<>the country of Ila1vr2ta. This mountain shines like gold.
<>(Chapter 7, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>MA1LYAVA1N IV. Another mountain near the Hima1-
<>layas. The Pa1n2d2avas visited this mountain on their way
<>to the mountain Gandhama1dana from the a1s4rama of
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a. (Chapter 153, Vana Parva).
<HI>MA1LYAVA1N V. A mountain situated in the country of
<>Kis2kindha1. The fight between Ba1li and Sugri1va took
<>place near this mountain. This is on the banks of the
<>river Tun3gabhadra1. Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a states that the
<>palace of Sugri1va was on the top of this mountain. S4ri1
<>Ra1ma stayed on the beautiful peak of this mountain for
<>four months. (S4loka 40, Chapter 280, Vana Parva).
<HI>MA1MA1N3KAM. Ma1ma1n3kam was a very important national
<>festival of Kerala. This festival used to be conducted on
<>the sandy beach of Tiruna1va1ya. It represented the crown-
<>ing ceremony of the sovereign of Kerala. There used to
<>be a grand assembly of all the artistes of Kerala. There
<>was an exhibition of the arts, trade and commerce of
<>the land attracting a huge crowd of people from differ-
<>ent parts of Bha1rata. Scholars believe that the word
<>Ma1ma1n3kam is derived from the Sanskrit word “Maha1- [Page473-b+ 65]
<>magha1”. Some say that it was so called because it was
<>conducted on the day of Magha1 in the month of
<>Ma1gha.
<NI>The festival was conducted under the auspices of the
<>supreme power in Malabar. For a long period Peru-
<>ma1ls were in power in Malabar and so Ma1ma1n3kam was
<>conducted under the control of the Peruma1ls. The last
<>of the line of Peruma1ls handed over the right to the
<>then mighty chief, the King of Valluvana1d2 and for
<>several years Ma1ma1n3kam was conducted under his aus-
<>pices. The foreign traders who came to Malabar, the
<>Mohammadans and the Portuguese, persuaded Sa1mu1tiri
<>(zamorin) to take control of this festival and with the
<>help of the foreigners Sa1mu1tiri wrested from the King
<>of Valluvana1d2 the right of conducting the Ma1ma1n3kam.
<>After some time the King. of Valluvana1d2 made an
<>attempt to get back the right from Sa1mu1tiri. This
<>enraged Sa1mu1tiri and there ensued a fight between
<>them resulting in much shedding of blood. An agree-
<>ment was reached that after twelve years each would
<>relinquish the right in favour of the other. So after
<>twelve years Sa1mu1tiri was compelled to relinquish his
<>right but by resorting to many sly tactics he retained
<>the right. The strength of Sa1mu1tiri increased and he
<>became a great power in Malabar. He was bold enough
<>to send away the Portuguese from the coast and
<>Sa1mu1tiri maintained his position till the advent of
<>Tippu Sultan to Malabar in the year 1788 A.D. Every
<>twelve years Sa1mu1tiri had to show his might to retain
<>the right of the Ma1ma1n3kam and those days of exhibit-
<>ing strength were ghastly.
<NI>The place of this Ma1ma1n3kam was at Tiruna1va1ya in Tiru1r
<>taluk. A S4iva temple of historic fame stands on the
<>shores of the river Bha1rata flowing through Tiru1r taluk.
<NI>There was an expansive sand beach on its shores,
<>become famous by being the scene of many socio-politi-
<>cal events there. It was the venue of the mighty
<>Nambu1diris of Malabar to discuss matters of socio-
<>political importance. Every year on the full-moon day
<>in the month of Ma1gha all the ruling chiefs of Kerala
<>would assemble there and on a special dais there
<>Sa1mu1tiri would sit with royal robes and a sword in his
<>right hand presiding over the assembly. The sword was
<>given to the Sa1mu1tiris by Cerama1n Peruma1l and was
<>considered the symbol of undisputed sovereignty of
<>Kerala. It was also a sanction to conduct the Ma1ma1n3-
<>kam. The Sa1mu1tiris came prepared to give a fight if their
<>authority was challenged by anybody. The ruling
<>Sa1mu1tiri would send an invitation to all chiefs of
<>Kerala. On either side of Sa1mu1tiri would sit the rela-
<>tives and friends of Sa1mu1tiri. There would be an army
<>of Nairs and Tiyyas ready outside and only after
<>defeating them could anybody approach the dais of
<>Sa1mu1tiri. The dais was called Nilapa1t2t2utara.
<NI>The whole atmosphere would resound with drummings
<>and shots from pop-guns. Majestic elephants adorned
<>with golden headdresses would be arrayed there. The
<>conference of the chiefs would last for twelve days and
<>the festival for twentyfour days. The Ma1ma1n3kam attract-
<>ed a huge crowd from far and wide because there were
<>then many items of interest and information. The
<>Ma1ma1n3kam commenced on a fixed day at an auspicious
<>hour in the morning when the caparisoned elephants
<>started moving to the accompaniment of drums and
<>pipes. The last Ma1ma1n3kam was in 1755 A.D. By the [Page474-a+ 64]
<>time of Ma1rttan2d2a Varma1 the centre of power shifted
<>from Malabar to the south. Even today the memories
<>of the same are brightening spots in the history of
<>Malabar.

<>him saying “You will also be beaten like this by a
<>brave monkey”. (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a).
<>(More details can be had from the entry An2i1ma1n2d2a-
<>vya). The a1s4rama of Ma1n2d2avya is considered a holy
<>place. Once the King of Ka1s4i1 went to this a1s4rama and
<>performed severe penance there. (Chapter 186, Udyoga
<>Parva).
<HI>MANDEHA(S). See the 2nd para under Pakal.
<HI>MA1NDHA1TA1. A King of pre-eminence in the dynasty
<>of Iks2va1ku.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descending in order from Vis2n2u were
<>born--Brahma1--Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Vivasva1n--

<>Anenas--Pr2thula1s4va--Prasenajit--Yuvana1s4va--
<>Ma1ndha1ta1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Yuvana1s4va, father of Ma1ndha1ta1 had a
<>hundred wives. Still he had no children. Greatly
<>griefstricken by the lack of a son he went to the forests
<>to see people of virtue and piety. During his
<>wandering in the forest he happened to reach a club
<>of sages. Yuvana1s4va went and sat in their midst. He
<>was happy to be in their midst but was worried in his
<>mind and so he sent up deep sighs as he sat there sad and
<>s4ilent. The sages asked him why he looked so sad and
<>the King crying like a child told them the cause of his
<>grief. The sages took pity on him and made him
<>conduct the ya1ga ‘Indradaivata’. They brought a jug
<>of water made potent by recitals of mantras to be
<>given to the queens to make them pregnant and placed
<>the pot in the ya1gas4a1la1. The ya1ga was coming to an
<>end. One day the King felt unusually thirsty and
<>unwilling to disturb the sages who were taking rest the
<>King entered the ya1gas4a1la1 and finding a jug there
<>full of water drank from it and quenched his thirst,
<>little knowing that it contained the water made
<>potent for a specific purpose by mantras. The next day
<>when the sages went to the ya1gas4a1la1 they found the
<>jug almost empty and were worried and started
<>making enquiries. The King then confessed what he
<>had done. The sages said that it was futile to fight
<>against fate and somehow finished the ya1ga and went
<>to their a1s4ramas.
<NI>The King became pregnant and after ten months a
<>child came out bursting open the right side of his
<>stomach. The King consulted his ministers as to
<>what should be done with the child and on their
<>advice the child was taken to the forests and left
<>there. But the child was protected by the Devas and [Page476-a+ 64]
<>they enquired among themselves as to whose breast-
<>feeding it would get when Indra appeared and said
<>“Ma1m3 Dha1ta1”, meaning it would drink me. That was
<>how the child got the name ‘Ma1ndha1ta1’. Indra thrust
<>the child's big toe into its mouth and the child began to
<>suck milk through it. Ma1ndha1ta1 who grew thus drink-
<>ing its own toe became a mighty man of renown. (7th
<>Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>3) {%Administration of the state and marriage.%} When
<>Ma1ndha1ta1 became a man of great strength his father
<>died and he ascended the throne and became an
<>Emperor of great fame. He conquered many kingdoms.
<>He made his enemies flee from him. Because he inti-
<>midated the dasyus he got the name Trasadasyu. He
<>married the perfect-figured chaste daughter Bindumati1
<>of S4as4abindura1ja. She got two sons named Purukutsa
<>and Mucukunda.
<NI>The Pura1n2as state that Ma1ndha1ta1 had another son
<>named Ambari1s2a and fifty daughters who were all
<>married to a sage named Saubhari.
<NI>4) {%How he caused rains in the country.%} Ma1ndha1ta1 ruled
<>the country very virtuously without at any time going
<>against truth and justice and his country became
<>prosperous. Once it so happened that there were no
<>rains for three successive years in the country and
<>the greatly worried King went to the forests to know
<>from the great sages there the reason for such a
<>calamity. The sages told the King thus: “Oh King,
<>of all yugas Kr2tayuga is the best. This yuga is a
<>brahmin-predominant one and Dharma stands on
<>four legs. Penance is for brahmins only and no man
<>of any other caste can do penance in this yuga. But
<>in your country a S4u1dra is performing penance and
<>that is why the clouds refuse to shower rains. Kill him
<>and then the evil will go”. Hearing this Ma1ndha1ta1
<>replied, “I will never kill an innocent ascetic. Teach
<>me my duty at this time of peril”. The sages were
<>pleased at the reply of the King and advised him thus:
<>“Oh King, start observing Vrata on the eka1das4i1 day.
<>(Eleventh day in each half of a month). The eka1das4i1
<>which falls in the bright half of Bha1drapada is called
<>‘Padmana1bha’, and if you observe it by its cogency you
<>will get not only rains but prosperity and happiness free
<>from misery of any kind. You must persuade your
<>subjects also to observe this”.
<NI>The King on returning to his palace started observing
<>‘eka1das4i1’ along with his subjects of all the four castes
<>and then it started to rain. Rains came in plenty and
<>all the crops were rich. The subjects became happy.
<>(Chapter 59, Padma Pura1n2a).

<HI>MAN2D2ODARI1 I. (MANDODARI1). (In South India
<>the name Man2d2odari1 is current). Wife of Ra1van2a.
<>The Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a contains a story about the
<>previous history of Mandodari1.
<NI>Maya, an asura, was born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his
<>wife Danu. Once Maya went to Devaloka to see the
<>dances of the celestial maidens there. Devas came to
<>know that Maya was in love with the nymph Hema1
<>and they married her to Maya. Maya went to the
<>southern vallcy of Himava1n and lived there with Hema1
<>constructing there a city called Hemapura. They got
<>two sons Ma1ya1vi1 and Dundubhi. But they grieved over
<>the lack of a daughter and she went to a side of
<>Himava1n and started penance there to get the bless-
<>ings of S4iva.
<NI>Once a celestial damsel named Madhura1 after observing
<>Somava1ravrata went to Kaila1sa to pay obeisance to
<>S4iva. Pa1rvati1 was absent from the place then, having
<>gone to attend the birthday celebrations of one of her
<>sons. So Madhura1 met S4iva sitting lonely and this led to
<>a clandestine sexual union between them. When Pa1rvati1
<>returned she saw traces of the ashes from the body of
<>S4iva on the naked breast of Madhura1 and Pa1rvati1 in
<>her anger cursed Madhura1 to live in a well for twelve
<>years as a frog. S4iva was stupefied at the curse and he
<>went to the well and consoled her by saying that she
<>would after the twelve years of life as a frog become
<>a very beautiful maiden and would be married by a
<>man of great fame and valour. It was near this well
<>that Maya and his wife were performing penance
<>to get a daughter.
<NI>After twelve years the frog changed itself into a beauti-
<>ful maiden and cried loudly from the well. Hearing
<>the cry Maya and Hema1, who were nearby peeped into
<>the well and seeing the young girl took her home and
<>brought her up giving her the name Mandodari1. Ra1van2a
<>returning after his victory march by that way visited
<>Maya and seeing the girl fell in love with her and
<>married her according to Vedic rites and took her to
<>Lan3ka1. Ra1van2a got three sons of her, Meghana1da,
<>Atika1ya and Aks2akuma1ra.
<NI>Mandodari1 was a very beautiful woman. Hanu1ma1n
<>when he entered the bed-room of Ra1van2a in search of
<>Si1ta1 was dumb-founded at the beauty of Mandodari1
<>and mistook her for a second for Si1ta1. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a).
<HI>MANDODARI1 II. A virtuous princess of the kingdom
<>of Sim3hala. She determined to live an unmarried life [Page477-a+ 64]
<>but was forced by destiny to marry a cruel and un-
<>charitable husband. The story of this Mandodari1 as
<>related to Devi1 by Mahis2a1sura is given below.
<NI>Candrasena, King of Sim3hala, got of his wife Gun2avati1
<>a very beautiful daughter named Mandodari1. Even
<>when she was ten years old the King started searching
<>for a suitable husband for her He found out Kambu-
<>gri1va son of Sudhanva1, King of Madrades4a and inform-
<>ed his daughter about his desire to make him his
<>son-in-law. But Mandodari1 replied that she never intend-
<>ed to marry and desired to spend her life worshipping
<>God. Candrasena felt miserable at her reply.
<NI>Years went by and Mandodari1 became a blooming
<>lady and yet she remained firm in her determination.
<>One day she was playing in the royal gardens with her
<>companions when the prince of Kosala, Vi1rasena came
<>that way by mistake. The extraordinary beauty of the
<>princess attracted him and he ma1de a request to her
<>through her companions to marry him. But Mandodari1
<>refused.
<NI>Time rolled on and soon the marriage of her younger
<>sister Indumati1 came. Candrasena invited all the neigh-
<>bouring Kings for that. The King of Madra Ca1rudes2n2a
<>was also present for the marriage. The King was very
<>charming to look at but was very bad in character.
<>Mandodari1 was attracted by his external beauty and she
<>expressed her willingness to marry him. Her father was
<>immensely pleased and on the nearest auspicious day
<>she was given in marriage to Ca1rudes2n2a.
<NI>Mandodari1 went to the palace of Ca1rudes2n2a and they
<>lived happily for some time. One day she saw her
<>husband having sexual acts with the wife of one of the
<>palace servants. She reproached her husband and yet
<>two days later she saw her husband with another
<>servant girl. She was greatly disappointed and she
<>left the palace for the forests where she started perform-
<>ing penance.
<HI>MAN2D2U1KA. A class of horse. These highclass horses
<>helped Arjuna in his campaign of victory. (S4loka 6,
<>Chapter 28, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>MAN2D2U1KA(S). A tribe. The King of this tribe was
<>A1yus. The daughter of A1yus, Sus4obha1 was married
<>to Pari1ks2it of Iks2va1ku dynasty. They had three sons,
<>S4ala, Dala and Bala. (Chapter 190, Vana Parva).
<HI>MAN3GALA. A deity in the form of Kuja or Planet Mars.
<>There are different versions in the Pura1n2as regarding
<>the birth of Man3gala.
<NI>(1) Sati1 committed suicide at the Daks2aya1ga and S4iva
<>greatly griefstricken at the loss of his wife started
<>penance. A sweat drop fell from the forehead of S4iva
<>doing severe penance and Man3gala was the son born
<>of that drop. S4iva then installed Man3gala among the
<>Navagrahas and according to the science of astrology
<>this Graha is considered the protector of the landed
<>property and the wife of a person. (S4iva Pura1n2a, Rudra
<>Sam3hita1 1-10 and Skanda Pura1n2a 4-1-17).
<NI>(2) S4iva married Vikes4i1 daughter of Hiran2ya1ks2a. One
<>day while they were engaged in sexual plays Agni
<>came to their presence. Enraged at this the eyes of S4iva
<>blazed with anger and a drop of hot water from his
<>eyes fell on the face of Vikes4i1 and she became pregnant.
<>After some days Vikes4i1 found it impossible to bear the
<>embryo of S4iva thus formed and she aborted it. A
<>child was born and the goddess of earth took it and [Page477-b+ 64]
<>fed it with breast milk. It was that child who later on
<>became Man3gala. (Skanda Pura1n2a).
<NI>(3) Man3gala was born of the blood drops of S4iva.
<>(Bhavis2ya Pura1n2a).
<NI>(4) Man3gala was the son of Bharadva1ja. (Gan2es4a
<>Pura1n2a).
<NI>(5) Man3gala was the son of Bhu1midevi1. Devas, sages,
<>Bra1hman2as, Manus and Gandharvas all worshipped
<>Bhu1mi at the time of Vara1hakalpa. It is also said in
<>the Vedas that Bhu1midevi1 is the wife of Maha1vis2n2u's
<>incarnation as Vara1ha. Man3gala alias the planet Mars
<>was born to Bhu1midevi1 of Maha1vis2n2u as Vara1ha. (9th
<>Skandha. Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>MAN3GALACAN2D2IKA1. A devi1. Vedas and Vedavids
<>alike praise this goddess who is always interested in
<>granting the requests of her devotees. Because she
<>showers prosperity on her devotees she became known
<>as Man3galacan2d2ika1. There is another version that she
<>got the name because she was worshipped by Man3gala
<>(Kuja) and because she grants the requests of Man3gala.
<>Yet another version is that she got the name because
<>she was worshipped by the King Man3gala chief of
<>the seven islands. Born of the species of Durga1devi1 she
<>is very kind and affectionate to her devotees. Parama-
<>s4iva worshipped this Devi1 before he went to destroy
<>the demon-trio Tripuras. (9th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1ga-
<>vata).
<HI>MAN2I I. A serpent born of the family of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra.
<>This serpent was burnt to death in the Sarpasatra of
<>Janamejaya. (S4loka 19, Chapter 57, A1di Parva).
<HI>MAN2I II. A sage. This sage was a member of the
<>Brahmasabha1. (S4loka 24, Chapter 11, Sabha1 Parva).
<HI>MAN2I III. One of the two Pa1rs2adas given to Subrah-
<>man2ya by Candra. The other one was named Suman2i.
<>(S4loka 32, Chapter 45, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MAN2I IV. A son born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his wife
<>Kadru1. Man2i lived near the city of Girivraja. This ser-
<>pent did penance to please S4iva and obtained a boon
<>that Garud2a should give refuge to him. (31: 6, A1di
<>Parva and Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).
<HI>MAN2IBHADRA I. A Yaks2a. He who worships this
<>Yaks2a would get his desire fulfilled. This Yaks2a is
<>installed in a temple near the city of Ta1mralipti. If any-
<>body commits adultery in that place Man2ibhadra would
<>take him to the temple and keep him there for the night.
<>Next morning he would take the couple before the
<>King and exposing the sin would get them killed by
<>the King.
<NI>Once a Vais4ya named Samudradatta committed adult-
<>ery and another house-holder found it out and took
<>them to the temple of Man2ibhadra and kept them there
<>S4aktimati1, the virtuous wife of Samudradatta came to
<>know of the mishap to her husband and the intelligent
<>woman went to the temple with materials for worship
<>and under the pretext of worshipping made the priest
<>of the temple open the doors. When she entered
<>Samudradatta felt ashamed and sat with his head bent
<>down. S4aktimati1 gave the other woman her own dress
<>taking hers in return and sent her out as S4aktimati1 with-
<>out raising the least suspicion in the priest. Then she
<>remained with Samudradatta, and when in the morn-
<>ing officers of the King came to take them they were
<>surprised to find that the culprits were really husband
<>and wife. The house-holder was punished for giving [Page478-a+ 64]
<>wrong information and Samudradatta was set free with
<>his wife. (Katha1mukhalambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>MAN2IBHADRA II. A King of the Lunar dynasty. This
<>King had many children of his wife Kavika1. Of these
<>seven sons learned magic from Maya. The seven palm
<>trees which S4ri Ra1ma broke by an arrow while on his
<>search for Si1ta1 were but the cursed forms of these seven
<>sons. The Pura1n2ic story relating to S4ri1 Ra1ma giving them
<>relief from the curse is narrated in the Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a
<>of Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>The seven sons of Man2ibhadra after learning magic
<>from Maya created a huge cobra and travelled all
<>over the world on it. One day they reached a
<>mountain near R2s2yamu1ka1cala. They saw the sage
<>Agastya coming that way and just to tease him they
<>coiled that cobra and hid it beneath the ground in the
<>form of a circle and they themselves stood on it as seven
<>palm trees in a circle and caused obstruction to the sage
<>in his path. The sage as he came near the trees knew
<>by his spiritual powers what trick had been played on
<>him and said cursing, “May you stand like this for ever”.
<>The princes knew the hideousness of the curse and
<>pleaded for redress and the sage said, “After centuries
<>the incarnation of Vis2n2u as S4ri1 Ra1ma would come and
<>give you salvation”.
<NI>The princes stood there as trees grown to unusual heights
<>with round black trunks casting shades all around.
<>Underneath grew a shrubbage deep and thick and the
<>seven trees stood there presenting to the onlookers a
<>sight of wonder.
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma and party reached the place of the seven trees.
<>Suddenly Ra1ma took his bow and arrows and pressing
<>his foot on a stone beneath sent an arrow and to the
<>wonder of all, the seven trees standing in a circle fell
<>all together and the arrow returned to his quiver.
<NI>When Ra1ma pressed the stone on the ground with his
<>foot he was pressing on a vital point on the head of the
<>cobra lying coiled in a circle under the ground bearing
<>the seven trees. The cobra got a shock and instantly
<>straightened itself for a second and the trees thus came
<>in a row straight on the path of the arrow of S4ri1 Ra1ma.
<>They were all cut at once and before they had time to
<>fall down the serpent coiled itself again and regained
<>his original position and so the trees fell down in the
<>circle in which they stood. All these happened so quickly
<>that nobody was able to see what happened and so every
<>body was surprised to see all the seven trees in a circle
<>falling down by a single arrow. The princes were thus
<>relieved from the curse.
<HI>MAN2IBHADRA III.

<HI>MA1N2IBHADRA. A Pa1rs2ada of S4iva. (See under Candra-

<HI>MAN2IKUT2T2IKA1. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka
<>20 Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MA1N2IKYAVA1CAKAR (MA1N2IKKA-VA1S4AHAR). A de-
<>votee and poet who lived in Tamilna1d2u. He is believed
<>to have lived during the period between the eighth and
<>ninth centuries A.D. He was born in Tiruva1davu1r in
<>an A1dis4aiva brahmin family. Tiruva1davu1r was a village
<>near Madura, the capital of Pa1n2d2ya kingdom. His
<>father was S4ambhupa1da1s4rita and mother S4ivajn5a1navati1.
<>The name given by his parents to Ma1n2ikyava1cakar is
<>still unknown. Because he was born in Tiruva1davu1r
<>everybody called him Tiruva1davu1ra1r. He became a
<>scholar in his sixteenth year. The Pa1n2d2ya king called
<>him to his palace and appointed him as his minister.
<>He gave him the honour of the title ‘Tennavar Brahma-
<>ra1yar’. Ma1n2ikyava1cakar showed more interest in devo-
<>tional matters than in matters of the state.
<NI>Once when the King was holding his durbar he got in-
<>formation that in one of the eastern ports had landed a
<>set of good war-horses for sale. He sent Tiruva1davu1ra1r
<>to that place. The minister, when near the port of
<>Tirupperundurai, heard a sound of Vedic utterances and
<>he immediately went to the place from where the sound
<>came. He saw Lord S4iva sitting under a tree in the guise
<>of a Guru. Forgetting all state affairs he became engross-
<>ed in the meditation of S4iva. Suddenly he developed
<>a talent for poetry and music and sweet attract-
<>ive poems in praise of S4iva started flowing
<>from his tongue. S4iva was immensely pleased and gave
<>him the name Ma1n2ikyava1cakar meaning that every
<>Va1caka (sentence) coming out of his tongue was equal
<>in value to a ma1n2ikya (Ruby). The guru gave him a
<>ruby too. Ma1n2ikyava1cakar in the garb of a mendicant
<>joined a troop of S4iva devotees and spent all the money
<>he had for the service of the devotees of S4iva and also
<>for the reconstruction of a dilapidated S4iva temple in
<>Tirupperundurai.
<NI>Ma1n2ikyava1cakar reached Madura and informed the
<>King that the horses would arrive at the palace on the
<>day A1van2i-mu1la (Mu1la star in the month of S4ra1van2a)
<>and presented the king with the ruby which his Guru
<>had given him. The king was not satisfied and he im-
<>prisoned him. On the A1van2i-mu1la day at the stipulat-
<>ed time the horses arrived at the palace. The horses
<>were led by strange foreigners. It was S4ri1 Parames4vara
<>himself who had come as the chief of the horsemen.
<>Ma1n2ikyava1cakar was released from jail and he also came
<>to see the horses. The King gave the leader of the troopers
<>a silk shawl as present. The head of the troopers received
<>it by the end of his whip. The King resented this but the [Page479-a+ 64]
<>troopers went back without any trouble. The horses
<>were put in stables and Ma1n2ikyava1cakar went to his
<>a1s4rama.
<NI>At midnight all the new horses in the stables turned in-
<>to jackals and roamed about in the streets howling
<>loudly and disturbing everyone. After some time they
<>all disappeared. The anger of the king knew no bounds.
<>He imprisoned Ma1n2ikyava1cakar again. The servants
<>of the king took him to river Vaigai. That day there
<>was an unusual flood in the river and the city of
<>Madura was submerged in waters. The king then realis-
<>ed his mistake and begged pardon of Ma1n2ikyava1cakar.
<>Ma1n2ikyava1cakar asked the king to repair the dam in
<>the Vaigai. The king assented to the proposal but to
<>save money the work was entrusted to the citizens of
<>Madura.
<NI>At that time there was an old woman in Madura called
<>Vanti1. She earned her livelihood by selling sweetmeats.
<>The servants of the king ordered her also to join the
<>work of the dam. She prayed to Paramas4iva and
<>then a young man came to the old woman and offered
<>to work for her in her stead. The young man representing
<>Vanti1 went to Vaigai and started to work for her. When
<>the king came to inspect the work he found the young
<>man not doing his work satisfactorily and struck him
<>on his back with a whip. A basketful of sand the young
<>man was carrying fell down and the work of the dam
<>was instantly completed. Not only that; all the persons
<>including the king felt as though they were struck.
<>Vanti1 attained Svarga and Ma1n2ikyava1cakar went to
<>Cidambaram. The king repented.
<NI>Ma1n2ikyava1cakar saw S4iva in person several times. Many
<>wonderful events happened at the Cidambaram temple
<>after the arrival of Ma1n2ikyava1cakar there. The King
<>of Lan3ka1 hearing about the greatness of Ma1n2ikyava1cakar
<>brought his dumb daughter to him and she gained the
<>power of speech. The Buddhist saints of Lan3ka1 came
<>to Ma1n2ikyava1cakar and entered into philosophical
<>discourse with him. They became dumb. The king of
<>Lan3ka1 and his followers became devotees of S4iva.
<NI>Ma1n2ikyava1cakar sat in his a1s4rama and composed divine
<>songs. Once S4iva in the guise of a brahmin came there
<>and copied the songs written by him. Even while he
<>was reciting his divine songs to the devotees his soul
<>left his body and merged with that of S4iva.
<NI>The divine songs in praise of S4iva by Ma1n2ikyava1cakar
<>constitute the eighth Khan2d2a of S4aivite hymns by name
<>“Tirumurai”. They include “Tiruva1cakam” and
<>“Tirukkovaiya1r”. The Tiruva1cakam contains 654 verses
<>in 51 hymns and the Tirukkovaiya1r contains 400 verses.

<>the outskirts of Ka1s4i1. Man3kan2a completed the temple
<>and Gan2es4a (Nikumbha) installed himself in that

<>Devotees began to flow into the temple and Nikumbha
<>sitting there answered the prayers of all. But he never

<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>MAN3KAN2AKA (MAN3KAN2A). A sage
<NI>1) {%General information.%} He was born to Va1yubhagava1n
<>of his wife Sukanyaka1. (S4loka. 58, Chapter 38, S4alya
<>Parva).
<NI>Va1mana Pura1n2a, 38th Chapter states that Man3kan2a
<>was one of the spiritual sons of Kas4yapapraja1pati.
<NI>2) {%Juice of potherb flows from finger.%} The sage was living
<>in Saptasa1rasvatati1rtha and one day by accident his
<>thumb was cut off from his hand by the sharp edge of
<>Kus4a grass. But instead of blood, the juice of potherb
<>began to flow from the thumb and the sage, overjoyed
<>at this strange phenomenon, started dancing. Along
<>with Man3kan2a the earth and the sky also started
<>dancing and the dancing showed no signs of stopping.
<>S4iva then appeared before Man3kan2a and asked him the
<>cause of his non-stop dancing. S4iva was in disguise and
<>Man3kan2a did not recognise the new-comer and the
<>sage told him about the strange phenomenon. As they
<>were talking S4iva touched the thumb of the sage with
<>his little finger and lo! the flow from the finger changed
<>from pot-herb juice to sugar-candy juice. Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a states that it was ashes which flowed from the
<>finger. The hermit was ashamed. He understood that
<>the guest was S4iva and he fell at his feet. S4iva blessed
<>the hermit and granted him boons. [Page480-b+ 65]
<NI>3) {%Man3kan2a falls in love with Sarasvati1 Devi1.%} One day
<>Sarasvati1devi1 came to the place of his residence in the
<>guise of a very attractive woman. Man3kan2a had seminal
<>emission on seeing her and the semen fell on the surface
<>of the water. The sage stored the water with semen
<>in a pot and soon seven sons were born from it. They
<>all became sages named Va1yuvega, Va1yubala,
<>Va1yuha1, Va1yuman2d2ala, Va1yujva1la, Va1yuretas and
<>Va1yucakra. (Chapter 83, Vana Parva and Chapter 38,

<>Man3kan2a who invoked the river Sarasvati1 and made
<>it flow through Kuruks2etra. Chapter 38, Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>MAN3KI I. A great sage. It was Bhi1s2ma, while he was
<>lying on his bed of arrows who narrated the story of
<>this sage. Man3ki was an aspirant of worldly things and
<>once he got two bullocks. He was ploughing with them
<>one day when a camel came and carried them away.
<>Disappointed he came to the a1s4rama and lamented
<>deeply over it. This lamentation became known later
<>as the famous Man3kigi1ta1. By the time the gi1ta1 reached
<>its end the mind of the sage was changed and he became
<>one bereft of all worldly desires and he acquired
<>moks2a. (Chapter 177, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>MAN3KI II. A sage who lived in Treta1yuga. He was
<>the son of Kaus2i1takibra1hman2a and was a Vais2n2avite of
<>great virtue. This sage had two wives named Suru1pa1
<>and Viru1pa1. Both had no sons and as per the advice of
<>his guru he went to Sabarmati1tat2a and did penance
<>there. After several years of rigorous austerities he got
<>very many children. The place where Man3kimahars2i
<>sat and did penance was known later as Man3kiti1rtha.
<>It is also called Saptasa1rasvata. In Dva1parayuga the
<>Pa1n2d2avas visited the place and gave it the name Sapta-
<>dha1ra also. (Uttara Khan2d2a, Padma Pura1n2a).
<HI>MANMATHAKARA. A warrior of Subrahman2ya.
<>There is a reference to this warrior in Maha1bha1rata,
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Verse 72.
<HI>MANODARI1. Wife of Da1ruka1sura. (See under Ghan2t2a1-
<>karn2a).
<HI>MANOGUN2A. Man may do many things, right or
<>wrong, good or bad, but it is the purity of your mind
<>that matters. The following story is to illustrate how
<>much your life depends on the quality of your thoughts
<>(Manogun2a).
<NI>Once on the shores of Gan3ga1 a Bra1hman2a and a
<>Can2d2a1la sat side by side and performed penance. After
<>some days of foodless penance the Bra1hman2a felt hungry
<>and his thoughts went to the fishermen he had seen
<>earlier. He thought thus, “Oh how happy are these
<>fishermen. They catch good fishes and eat to their
<>heart's content and are happy. They are the luckiest
<>people of this world”. The thoughts of the Can2d2a1la
<>also went to the fishermen. But he thought thus: “Oh
<>how cruel are these fishermen! How many innocent
<>lives do they destroy to fill their belly. They must be
<>demons to do so.” Both of them died after some days
<>and the Bra1hman2a was born as a fisherman and the
<>Can2d2a1la a prince. Both of them were re-born near
<>their abodes in their previous birth and both remem-
<>bered their previous lives. The Can2d2a1la was happy but [Page481-a+ 65]
<>the Bra1hman2a regretted his fault. (Taran3ga 1, Madana-
<>man5cuka1lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>MANOHARA1 I. Wife of the Vasu, Soma. Varcas was
<>born of her first. Then she had three more sons named
<>S4is4ira, Pra1n2a and Raman2a. (S4loka 22, Chapter 66, A1di

<HI>MANOHARA1 II. A nymph of Alaka1puri1. Once when
<>As2t2a1vakra went to the court of Kubera this nymph
<>gave a performance in dancing in honour of that sage.
<>(S4loka 45, Chapter 19, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>MANOJAVA I. The eldest son of the Vasu Anila.
<>Anila begot this son of his wife S4iva1. (S4loka 25,
<>Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<HI>MANOJAVA II. During the Manvantara of Ca1ks2us2a,

<>the Devas. (Am3s4a 3, Chapter 160, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>MANOJAVA III. A follower of Subrahman2ya. (S4loka 17,
<>Chapter 46, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MANOJAVA IV. A sacred place situated in Vya1savana

<>participated in the Janmotsava of Arjuna. (S4loka 62,
<>Chapter 122, A1di Parva).
<HI>MANORAMA1 III. Once by his spiritual powers the
<>sage Udda1laka brought the river Sarasvati1 to his place
<>of yajn5a and that diversion was then known as Mano-
<>rama1. (S4loka 25, Chapter 38, S4alya Parva).
<HI>MANORATHA. A calf once created by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a by
<>his spiritual powers. (See under Surabhi).
<HI>MANOVATI1. The city of Brahma1. This city is situated
<>in the centre of the nine cities on the top of the
<>mountain Maha1meru. Around it are the cities of the
<>As2t2adikpa1lakas. (8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<HI>MANTHARA1 I. A maid of Kaikeyi1 the wife of
<>Das4aratha. This hunchbacked woman was born of the
<>species of a Gandharvi1 named Dundubhi1. (S4loka 10,
<>Chapter 276, Vana Parva). When everything was
<>made ready to crown S4ri1 Ra1ma as the heir-apparent
<>of Ayodhya1, it was Manthara1 who persuaded Kaikeyi1
<>to go to Das4aratha and ask him to send S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>to the forests. Had not the cruel tongue of Manthara1
<>played like that, the history of the solar dynasty itself
<>would have been different. (See under Kaikeyi1).

<>Pradha1. (Chapter 59, Verse 44, A1di Parva).
<HI>MA1NUS2ATI1RTHA. A sacred pond lying on the
<>outskirts of Kuruks2etra. There is a legend showing
<>the origin of this pond. Once a hunter wounded a
<>deer with his arrow and the deer ran and dropped
<>itself into the pond. When it rose up from the water
<>it became a man. From that day onwards the pond
<>became holy and got the name Ma1nus2ati1rtha. (S4loka
<>65, Chapter 86, Vana Parva).
<HI>MANUSMR2TI. A code of conduct written by Manu
<>alias Ma1nava1ca1rya who was the father of man-kind for
<>the harmonious existence of a social life. The book
<>contains twelve chapters. The first chapter deals with
<>the origin of the Smr2ti and the origin of the world.
<>No other Smr2ti begins like this and so it is believed
<>that this chapter must have been added to it later.
<>The contents of each of the other eleven chapters are

<NI>{%Second chapter.%} It deals with the sense organs and
<>stresses the importance of conquering and controlling

<NI>The basis of the present Hindu Law is Manusmr2ti and
<>it is believed to have been written in B.C. 500. [Page482-a+ 64]
<HI>MANUS2YA (MAN) The Pura1n2as have not given a
<>definite explanation regarding the origin of Man, the
<>most important of all living beings. Many stories
<>regarding the origin of Man were current among the
<>ancient people. According to Hindu Pura1n2as Man
<>was born of Sva1yambhuva Manu who in turn was born
<>of Brahma1. According to Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a (Sarga 14,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a) all the living beings including man
<>were born to Kas4yapapraja1pati of his eight wives,
<>Aditi, Diti, Danu, Ka1lika1, Ta1mra1, Krodhavas4a1, Manu
<>and Anala1. From Aditi were born the devas; from
<>Diti, the daityas; from Danu, the da1navas; from Ka1li1,
<>the asuras Ka1laka and Naraka; from Ta1mra1, the bird-
<>flock Kraun5ci1, Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and Suki1;
<>from Krodhavas4a1 the animal flock, Mr2gi1, Mr2gamanda1,
<>Hari1, Bhadramada1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, Sveta1 and
<>Surabhi; from Manu, mankind and from Anala1, the
<>flora.
<NI>There is basis to believe that the Greeks and the people
<>of Bha1rata accepted with slight modifications the
<>theory of evolution. The Das4a1vata1ras of Vis2n2u almost
<>represents the progressive changes in the form of a
<>living thing from a fish into man. The theory of
<>Darwin that life was first formed in water was current
<>among the sages of ancient Bha1rata, even from very
<>early times.
<Poem>Apa eva sasarja1dau
<>Ta1su vi1ryamapa1sr2jat // </Poem>
<>(He created water first and cast virility therein).
<NI>In the Das4a1vata1ras (ten incarnations of Vis2n2u) the
<>first avata1ra is Matsya (Fish). The next one is Ku1rma
<>or Tortoise which is a progress in the form of fish.
<>The third is Vara1ha or boar which is another step
<>forward in evolution. The fourth is Narasim3ha (Man
<>cum lion) which is the first step towards the formation
<>of Man. That avata1ra has got the traits of both man
<>and animal. The next one is Va1mana or a small man.
<>Then S4ri1 Ra1ma and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, both fully grown men
<>but with different kinds of culture.
<HI>MANVANTARA(M).
<NI>1) {%Kalpa, Manvantara and Caturyuga.%} The Prapan5ca
<>(universe) is perishable. At one time, it takes its origin,
<>at another time it perishes. Brahma1, the creator of
<>the universe has birth and death. The period between
<>the birth and death of a Brahma1 is known as a “Maha1-
<>kalpa”. The flood that comes at the death of a Brahma1
<>is called “Maha1pralaya”. One day of Brahma1 is called
<>Kalpaka1la. In the Pura1n2as one Kalpa or one day of
<>Brahma1 is divided into fourteen parts. The master or
<>ruler of each of these divisions is a Manu. There are
<>fourteen Manus. The life span of each Manu is called
<>a “Manvantaram”.
<NI>There are seventy one Caturyugas in each Manvantara.
<>The four yugas namely Kr2tayuga, Treta1yuga, Dva1para-
<>yuga and Kaliyuga make np one Caturyuga. At the end
<>of seventyone such Caturyugas, that is, at the end of
<>every two hundred and eightyfour (71 × 4) yugas, a
<>Manu completes his life-span. Along with that, the
<>Devas who were born at the time of the birth of that
<>Manu, also come to the end of their lives. Fourteen such
<>Manvantaras make one day of Brahma1. It is at the end
<>of that day that the original universe perishes. Brahma1's
<>life-span is 120 years. At the end of that period, that
<>Brahma1 perishes. That is to say, at the end of every [Page482-b+ 65]
<>42,200 divine days (120 × 360) which is the life-span of
<>a Brahma1, a deluge takes place. Thus in one Brahma1's
<>time 42,200 Kalpas take place. A Brahma1's life span
<>is known as “Maha1kalpa” and the close of a Brahma1's
<>period is called “Maha1pralaya”.
<NI>2) {%Human year (Manus2ya vars2a) and Divine year (Deva
<>vars2a).%} When two leaves are placed one over the other
<>and they are pierced by a needle, the time required
<>for the needle to pass from the first leaf to the second
<>is called “Alpaka1la”. Thirty such alpaka1las make one
<>“Trut2i”. Thirty trut2is make one “Kala1”. Thirty Kala1s
<>make one “Ka1s2t2ha1”, which is also known as “Nimis2a”
<>“Not2i” or “Ma1tra1”. Four “Nimis2as” make one
<>“Gan2ita”. Ten Gan2itas, one “Net2uvi1rppu”. Six net2u-
<>vi1rppus, one “Vina1zhika1”. Sixty vina1zhika1s one
<>“Ghat2ika1”. Sixty ghat2ika1s one day (day and night
<>together). Fifteen days, one “Paks2a”. Two Paks2as, one
<>“Ca1ndra ma1sa” (lunar month). One Ca1ndrama1sa for
<>human beings is one “ahora1tra” (one day and night
<>making up one full day) for the pitr2s. Twelve Ca1ndra
<>ma1sas make one year for human beings. One year for
<>human beings is one ahora1tra for the gods. Three
<>hundred ahora1tras of gods make one “Deva Vatsara”
<>or “Divya vatsara”. 4,800 divyavatsaras make one Kr2ta-
<>yuga. 3,600 divyavatsaras make one Treta1yuga, 2,400
<>divyavatsaras make one Dva1parayuga. 1,200 divya-
<>vatsaras make one Kaliyuga. 12,000 divyavatsaras
<>comprising a set of Kr2ta, Treta1. Dva1para and Kaliyugas
<>make one Caturyuga. A Manu's period is completed
<>at the end of 71 Caturyugas. With that, the first
<>group of gods also comes to an end. At the end of four-
<>teen such Manus, one “Kalpa” is over and a deluge
<>takes place. The whole of this period comprises one
<>night for Brahma1. Night is the time of complete inacti-
<>vity. With the end of the night, creation is started
<>again. When 360 such ahora1tras of Brahma1 are com-
<>pleted, he completes one year. After completing 120
<>such years, a Brahma1 perishes. Again a period of abso-
<>lute inactivity follows for the length of a Brahma1's
<>life-span. After a period of 120 Brahma vars2as (the life-
<>span of a Brahma1) another Brahma1 comes into being.
<NI>The life-span of Brahma1 is shown in the following
<>tabular form:
<>360 days for gods--One Deva vatsara.
<>12,000 Deva vatsaras--1 caturyuga (36 lakhs years
<>for human beings).
<>71 caturyugas--1 Manvantaram (One
<>Manu's life-span).
<>14 Manvantaras--1 Kalpa (one day time for
<>Brahma1)
<>2 Kalpas--One day (and night) for
<>Brahma1. (Ahora1tra)
<>360 days of Brahma1--1 Brahma Vars2a
<>120 Brahma Vars2as--One Brahma1's life-span.
<NI>This life-span of one Brahma1 is therefore 30 crores 9
<>lakhs 17 thousands 376 hundreds of years of human
<>beings.
<NI>It is said that a Manu's period of reign is 4,32,000
<>Manus2yarvars2as. (Bha1gavata, 3rd Skandha).
<NI>3) {%The caturyuga scheme.%} A caturyuga consists of the
<>four yugas, namely Kr2ta, Treta1, Dva1para and Kali
<>yugas. At the end of each Caturyuga, the Vedas perish
<>Then the “Saptars2is” (seven sages) come down from
<>heaven to the earth and restore them again. Manu
<>who is the propounder of Dharma s4a1stra, is also born [Page483-a+ 65]
<>in every Kr2tayuga. The Devas of each Manvantaram
<>feed upon the share of Havis (offerings at sacrifices) of
<>the ya1ga till the end of that Manvantara. During the
<>whole period of the Manvantara, the earth is protected
<>and preserved by the sons of Manu and their descen-
<>dants. Thus Manu, the Saptars2is, Devas, Indra and the
<>Kings who are the sons of Manu are the authorities of
<>the Manvantara. After 14 Manvantaras a Kalpa of
<>about 1,000 yugas, comes to an end. After that there is
<>a night extending over the same period in duration. At
<>that time Maha1vis2n2u sleeps on his bed Ananta in the
<>ocean of deluge. After that, he wakes up again and
<>performs creation. Manus, Kings, Indra, Devas and
<>Saptars2is are the Sa1ttvika aspects of Maha1vis2n2u, who
<>performs the work of protecting the world. In Kr2ta
<>yuga, Maha1vis2n2u assumes the form of Kapila and others
<>and preaches “Paramajn5a1na”. In Treta1 yuga he assumes
<>the form of an emperor and destroys the wicked people.
<>In Dva1para yuga, he assumes the form of Vya1sa and
<>after dividing the Veda into 4 sections, classifies each
<>of the sections into the various branches. At the end
<>of Kaliyuga, Maha1vis2n2u assumes the form of Kalki and
<>restores the vicious to the path of righteousness. This is
<>the “Caturyuga scheme” of Maha1vis2n2u. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a.

<>were once offering worship to the idol of Devi1 on the
<>banks of the river Ka1lindi1. After twelve years, Devi1
<>appeared, under the name of Bhramara1mbika1 and blessed
<>them that in their next births they would become
<>rulers of Manvantaras. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>2) It is said that the four Manus, Sva1rocis2a, Uttama,
<>Ta1masa and Raivata belonged to Priyavrata's family.
<>It was because Priyavrata who was a Ra1jars2i offered
<>tapas to Vis2n2u that four Manus were born in his family.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a. Part III, Chapter 1).
<NI>3) It is the power of Vis2n2u that dominates all the
<>Manvantaras as the basic divinity. In the first Sva1yam-
<>bhuva Manvantara it was a part of that power of Vis2n2u
<>itself that originated as Yajn5apurus2a in A1bhu1ti. After
<>that when Sva1rocis2a Manvantara came it was again that
<>divinity that took its origin in Tus2ita1 as Ajita among the [Page486-a+ 64]
<>Tus2itas. In Uttama Manvantara that divinity Tus2ita him
<>self was born again under the name of Satya as the son of
<>Satya1 in the group of Devas called Satyas. When Ta1masa
<>Manvantara began, that divinity was born again as the
<>son of Harya1 as a Hari in the group of Devas called
<>Haris. It was that divinity Hari himself who was born
<>in Sambhu1ti under the name of Ma1nasa among the
<>Devas called Raivatas in Raivata Manvantara. In Ca1ks2us2a
<>Manvantara that Vis2n2u Bhagava1n took birth in Vikun2t2hi1
<>as one of the Vaikun2t2has. In the present Vaivasvata
<>Manvantara, Vis2n2u has incarnated in Aditi as Va1mana,
<>the son of Kas4yapa. That great Va1mana conquered
<>all the three worlds and presented them to Devendra.
<>(Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part III, Chapter 2).
<NI>Besides the fourteen Manus mentioned above, certain
<>other Manus are also referred to in the Pura1n2as. Some
<>details about them are given below:--
<NI>(1) It is seen from Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a,
<>14th Sarga, verse 11, that Kas4yapa had a wife named
<>Manu.
<NI>(2) There is a reference to a Ra1jars2i (Saintly king)
<>named Manu in R2gveda, first Man2d2ala, 16th Anuva1ka,
<>112th Su1kta.
<NI>(3) A son named Manu was born to the Agni Tapa or
<>Pa1n5cajanya. This Manu has another name Bha1nu. He
<>had three wives named Supraja1, Br2hadbha1sa1 and Nis4a1.
<>Six sons were born to him by the first two wives. By
<>his third wife he had one daughter and seven sons.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 221, Verse 4).
<NI>(4) In Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 57, verse 43,
<>we find a reference to another Manu named Pracetas.
<HI>MA1NYAVATI1. Wife of Aviks2it, son of Karandhama.
<>Ma1nyavati1 daughter of Bhi1mara1ja was carried away by
<>force by Aviks2it from the marriage hall on the marriage
<>day. (Ma1rkan2d2eya Pura1n2a).
<HI>MANYU I. A Vedic god. The origin of this god is des-
<>cribed in Brahma Pura1na as follows:--
<NI>Once a terrible war broke out between Devas and
<>Asuras. The Devas who were defeated, went to the
<>Gautami1 river valley and performed penance to S4iva
<>praying for victory. S4iva produced Manyu from his
<>third eye and presented him to the Devas. In the
<>battle which followed they defeated the Asuras with the
<>help of Manyu.
<HI>MANYU II. A king of the Pu1ru dynasty. Bha1gavata, 9th
<>Skandha states that Manyu, the son of Bharadva1ja, had
<>five sons including Br2hatks2aya.
<HI>MANYUMA1N. Second son of the Agni Bha1nu. (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 221, Verse 11).
<HI>MARAN2A (M) (DEATH). Death is a goddess whose
<>name is Mr2tyu. The Pura1n2as state that there was no
<>death in the world before the birth of this goddess. In
<>Maha1bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter 53 there is the
<>following story about the circumstances in which
<>Brahma1 created Mr2tyu.
<NI>Living beings multiplied endlessly on earth. As they
<>had no death, the goddess Earth found their weight too
<>much for her to bear. She went weeping to Brahma1 and
<>prayed for his help. At that time, Rudra and Na1rada
<>were present in Brahma1's assembly. Brahma1 said that
<>he did not like destroying living beings. Because of
<>the pressure of Rudra and Na1rada, Brahma1 created out
<>of Vis4vapraka1sa (Cosmic Light) a woman. She
<>was born from the south and Brahma1 gave her the [Page486-b+ 65]
<>name “Mr2tyu”. He gave her permission to destroy
<>human beings.
<NI>When she heard that she was to kill living beings, she shed
<>tears and Brahma1 gathered those tears. She went to
<>Dhenuka1s4rama and other places and performed tapas. At
<>last Brahma1 called her back and assured her that it was
<>not against Dharma to kill living beings. He changed
<>the tears he had gathered from her face into the various
<>diseases and returned them to her. He gave those dis-
<>eases and the god Yama as her companions. Thus the
<>goddess Mr2tyu started her dance of destruction. (See
<>also under the word PUNARJANMA).
<HI>MA1RDAMAHARS2I. One of the sons of Vis4va1mitra who
<>was a Brahmava1di1. (S4loka 57, Chapter 4, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva).
<HI>MA1RGAN2APRIYA1. A daughter born to Kas4yapa Praja1-
<>pati of his wife Pradha1. (S4loka 45, Chapter 65, A1di
<>Parva).
<NI>MA1RGAS4I1RS2AMA1SA. The month of Dhanu (Decem-
<>ber). The month has got great Pura1n2ic importance.
<>If one lives taking food only once during the whole of
<>this month one will be free from all sins and diseases.
<>(S4loka 17, Chapter 106, Anus4a1sana Parva). If on the
<>Dva1das4i1 day in this month one fasts the whole day
<>and night and worships Kes4ava one will get the
<>benefit of conducting an As4vamedha yajn5a. (S4loka 3,
<>Chapter 109, Anus4a1sana Parva).
<HI>MARI1CA. A Da1nava. There is a reference to him in
<>Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a.
<HI>MA1RI1CA I. The uncle of Ra1van2a.
<NI>1). {%Birth.%} On the banks of the river Sarayu1, there were
<>two states lying adjacent called Malada and Karu1s2a.
<>The great sages conducted Jaladha1ra1 (showering of
<>water) on the head of Indra to absolve him of his sin
<>of killing Vr2tra1sura at this place. At that time Mala (ex-
<>creta) and Karu1s2a (spittings) of Indra fell at those places
<>and so they got the name of Malada and Karu1s2a. At
<>that place was born after a few years a demoness named
<>Ta1t2aka1 who had the strength of a thousand elephants.
<>A demon called Sunda married Ta1t2aka1 and she got
<>two sons named Ma1ri1ca and Suba1hu. (Sarga 24, Ba1la
<>Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a and Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Ma1ri1ca in his previous birth.%} Ma1ri1ca was the servant
<>of the gate-keepers of Vaikun2t2ha. One day Maha1vis2n2u
<>was displeased by a conduct of his and he cursed him
<>to be born as a demon on earth. But he added that
<>Ma1ri1cawould get salvation from the curse when he was
<>killed by S4ri1 Ra1ma in which capacity Vis2n2u would in-
<>carnate soon. He would then return to Vaikun2t2ha to
<>his original place. That was how Ma1ri1ca was born as
<>the uncle of Ra1van2a.
<NI>3) {%A1s4rama life.%} Ma1ri1ca and Suba1hu were two insepara-
<>ble brothers. They learned all tactics of war and their
<>hobby was to torment the innocent sages of the forests
<>(Sarga 19, Ba1laka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a). When
<>the exploits of Ma1ri1ca became unbearable, Vis4va1mitra
<>brought Ra1ma and Laks2man2a from Ayodhya1 for help.
<>The instant Ma1ri1ca heard the fierce twang of Ra1ma's
<>bow he fled to the other shore of the sea. From that
<>day onwards Ma1ri1ca grew matted hair and wore
<>barks of trees and spent his life in an a1s4rama. (Sargas
<>35 and 36, Aran2yaka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%Death.%} When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were living in
<>the Dan2d2aka1ran2ya with Si1ta1 they were annoyed by a [Page487-a+ 65]
<>demoness named S4u1rpan2akha1. In the fight that ensued
<>very many demons were killed. S4u1rpan2akha1 complained
<>to Ra1van2a who decided to kill Ra1ma and carry away
<>Si1ta1. For this he sought the help of his uncle Ma1ri1ca.
<>Flying in his golden Vima1na and crossing mountains and
<>oceans he approached Ma1ri1ca and told him of his plan.
<>Ma1ri1ca who was aware of the force of Ra1maba1n2a dis-
<>suaded Ra1van2a from such a venture. But Ra1van2a
<>persisted in his plan and gave Ma1ri1ca the following
<>instructions: “Become a golden deer with beautiful
<>white spots all over the body and roam about near the
<>a1s4rama of Ra1ma for his wife Si1ta1 to see. I am sure Si1ta1
<>will request her husband Ra1ma to catch hold of you.
<>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a will follow you and Si1ta1 will be
<>left alone. I will then carry away Si1ta1 as Ra1hu takes
<>Candrika1 (moonlight) and live happily with her. I will
<>be contented if I can then tease Ra1ma who will be
<>lamenting over his separation from his wife”. Thinking
<>that it would be better to die at the hands of Ra1ma
<>than at the hands of Ra1van2a, Ma1ri1ca agreed to do as
<>his nephew desired.
<NI>Ra1van2a and Ma1ri1ca came near the a1s4rama of Ra1ma in
<>Ra1van2a's aerial chariot. Ma1ri1ca on alighting from it
<>took the form of a beautiful fawn and entered the pre-
<>cincts of the a1s4rama. The false fawn was capable of
<>attracting the attention of anybody. It is described
<>thus: “It appeared as a wonder to those who saw it.
<>It was golden in colour with blue horns with white
<>lines on it. The ears were like leaves of blue lotus and
<>the face was of the colour of red lotus. The lips were like
<>sapphire and the body beautifully shaped with sides
<>like yellow flowers. The waist was thin and well-shaped
<>and a rain-bow-coloured tail adorned its back. The
<>whole body was silver-spotted and the deer was a feast
<>for the eyes of anybody.”
<NI>The deer went and grazed in places where it could be
<>seen by Si1ta1. It would run away from the a1s4rama and
<>graze hidden from Si1ta1 but would come back again to
<>the vision of Si1ta1. It would mix with the deer of the
<>a1s4rama for some time and run away from them to dis-
<>tant places. Like a butterfly it flitted about always
<>trying to attract the attention of Si1ta1. Other deer appro-
<>ached it but on getting its scent flew away from it. The
<>false deer suppressing the demon-instinct in him to kill
<>and eat the animals which came near it played well the
<>role of a fawn.
<NI>Si1ta1 was enamoured of the deer and expressed to Ra1ma
<>her desire to get it. Ra1ma followed it and finding it
<>keeping a distance always got suspicious and shot it
<>down with an arrow. The deer cried “Ha1 Laks2man2a”
<>and fell down dead. The cry was intended to mislead
<>Laks2man2a and draw him also away from Si1ta1.
<>(Chapters 43-44, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MA1RI1CA II. Kas4yapapraja1pati. Mari1ci was the father
<>of Kas4yapa and so Kas4yapa was known as Ma1ri1ca also.
<>(Sarga 46, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MARI1CI I. A Mahars2i (sage) born from Brahma1's
<>mind.
<NI>1) {%Birth and Genealogy.%} The six great sages born from
<>Brahma1's mind were:--Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya,
<>Pulaha and Kratu, according to Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva.
<NI>2) {%Domestic life.%} Mari1ci had several wives and children.
<>He married Kala1, the daughter of Kardama Praja1pati
<>by his wife Devahu1ti. Mari1ci had two sons Kas4yapa [Page487-b+ 64]
<>and Pu1rn2iman by Kala1. This Kas4yapa was the original
<>ancestor of all living beings. But Pu1rn2iman's family did
<>not become well-known. Pu1rn2iman had two sons, Virajas
<>and Vis4vaga and a daughter Devakulya1. Devakulya1
<>washed the feet of Maha1vis2n2u and merged with A1ka1s4a
<>Gan3ga1.
<NI>U1rn2a1 was another wife of Mari1ci. Six sons were born
<>to U1rn2a1. Under a curse of Brahma1 they were born first
<>as the sons of Hiran2yakas4ipu and in their next birth
<>as the sons of Vasudeva and Devaki1. It was these six
<>children who were born as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's elder brothers
<>whom Kam3sa killed immediately after their birth.
<>(See under Kr2s2n2a).
<NI>Mari1ci had another wife named Sambhu1ti. She gave
<>birth to Paurn2ama1sa. In Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part I, Chapter
<>10, we see that Paurn2ama1sa who was a Maha1tma1 had
<>two sons Virajas and Parvata. Dharmavrata1 was yet
<>another wife of Mari1ci. She was a daughter born to
<>Dharmavati1 by Dharmadeva.
<NI>3) {%Dharmavrata1 cursed.%} Mari1ci lived happily for long
<>with his wife Dharmavrata1. Once he returned from
<>the forest, carrying darbha grass, flowers etc.
<>He was tired after a long walk. After taking food, he
<>wanted his wife to massage his legs. While she was
<>massaging him Mari1ci fell asleep. Just then Brahma1
<>happened to come there. Dharmavrata1 was in a fix.
<>She had to attend to her husband and at the same time
<>receive Brahma1 with due respect. She could not leave
<>her husband's guru (Sire). It was her duty to honour
<>him properly.
<NI>At last she got up and welcomed Brahma1, offering
<>him the customary honours. Meanwhile Mari1ci woke
<>up and not finding his wife near him cursed her to be
<>turned into a stone. Dharmavrata1 who was distressed
<>at the curse pleaded innocence and explained to him
<>that she had been honouring his guru. She warned him
<>that he would incur the curse of S4iva.
<NI>Under Mari1ci's curse Dharmavrata1 was separated from
<>him. She performed penance in the midst of fires. Maha1-
<>vis2n2u appeared before her and asked her what boon
<>she wanted. She prayed that her curse might be lifted.
<>Vis2n2u replied:--“It was Mari1ci who cursed you. That
<>curse cannot be withdrawn. You will be turned into a
<>sacred stone. Your name “Dharmavrata1” will be
<>changed into “Devavrata1”. In future, that stone will
<>become famous under the name “Devavrata1” or “Deva-
<>s4ila1”. Brahma1, Vis2n2u, Mahes4vara and goddesses like
<>Laks2mi1 will dwell in that stone.”
<NI>After saying this, Maha1vis2n2u disappeared. Once
<>Dharmadeva held this Devas4ila1 above the demon Gaya
<>and the place became famous under the name of “Gaya1
<>ti1rtha”. (See under Gaya1ti1rtha).
<NI>4) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Mari1ci had participated in the celebration connect-
<>ed with Arjuna's birth. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 122,

<>who was lying on “S4ara S4ayya1” (bed of arrows). (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 47, Verse 10). [Page488-a+ 65]
<NI>(v) Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 334, Verse 35,
<>mentions that Mari1ci is a Praja1pati.
<NI>(vi) Mari1ci is one of the group of sages known as Citra-

<NI>(vii) Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 340, Verse
<>44, describes Mari1ci as one of the As2t2aprakr2tis.
<NI>(viii) Mari1ci once visited Dhruva who was performing
<>penance and gave him advice. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part I,
<>Chapter 11).
<HI>MARI1CI II. A celestial woman. In Maha1bha1rata, A1di
<>Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 62 we find that she attended
<>a dance at the celebrations at the time of Arjuna's
<>birth.
<HI>MARI1CI III. An author of Dharmas4a1stra. His state-
<>ments are quoted in Apara1rka1, Smr2ticandrika1, Mita1-
<>ks2ara1 and other works.
<HI>MA1RIS2A1 I. A nymph created as a maiden of the Flora
<>(See under Kan2d2u).
<HI>MA1RIS2A1 II. A river of Pura1n2ic fame. (S4loka 36,
<>Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>MA1RIS2A1. A place of habitation of ancient Bha1rata.
<>(S4loka 69, Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma Parva).
<HI>MA1RJA1RA. Son of Ja1mbava1n. It is said in Brahmapura1n2a
<>that the ma1rja1ras (cats) have their origin from this
<>son of Ja1mbava1n.
<HI>MARKA. See under the word S4an2d2a1marka.
<HI>MA1RKAN2D2EYA. The son of Mr2kan2d2u. He was a great
<>devotee of S4iva.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Bhr2gu, son of Brahma1, begot of his wife
<>Khya1ti a daughter named Laks2mi1 and two sons named
<>Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1.
<NI>Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1 married A1yati and Niyati daughters
<>of Maha1meru. Dha1ta1 begot of his wife A1yati a son
<>named Pra1n2a and Niyati bore Vidha1ta1 a son named
<>Mr2kan2d2u Ma1rkan2d2eya was the son of Mr2kan2d2u and
<>Vedas4iras was the son of Ma1rkan2d2eya.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} Mr2kan2d2u did not have sons for a long time and
<>so he performed penance for several years to please S4iva
<>to get a son. S4iva appeared before him in person and
<>asked him thus “Do you desire to have a virtuous, wise and
<>pious son who would live up to sixteen years or a dull-
<>witted evil-natured son who would live long?” Mr2kan2d2u
<>chose the first type and soon a son was born. He was
<>named Ma1rkan2d2eya. Even from boyhood Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>knew all the Vedas and s4a1stras. His pleasing manners
<>got the approval of his teachers and the boy was liked by
<>one and all. But the parents were sad and whenever they
<>looked at their son a gloom spread over their face. The
<>secret of the short span of his life was hidden from him.
<NI>The sixteenth year was fast approaching and one day
<>unable to control their grief they wept before him. Ma1r-
<>kan2d2eya asked them the reason why they wept. Mr2kan2d2u
<>with tears running down his cheeks told him the story.
<>From that day onwards Ma1rkan2d2eya started performing
<>penance wearing barks of trees for his dress and growing
<>matted hair. The boy was soon engrossed in severe aus-
<>terities.
<NI>The day of his death came and the boy sat before the
<>idol of S4iva in deep meditation. The servants of the god
<>of Death could not approach Ma1rkan2d2eya for the radia-
<>tion from him was too hot for them. So Yama, the god
<>of Death, himself came to fetch him. Then Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>crying loudly for help embraced the idol before him.
<>Yama threw his rope in a loop and it went and circled
<>round the idol also. Angry S4iva rose from the idol and [Page488-b+ 65]
<>coming down killed Yama to save the child. From that
<>day onwards S4iva got the names Mr2tyun5jaya and Ka1la-
<>ka1la. After that at the request of the devas S4iva gave
<>life to Yama again and made Ma1rkan2d2eya to be of six-
<>teen years for ever.
<NI>3) {%Penance of Ma1rkan2d2eya.%} The Pura1n2as state that after
<>getting the blessing from S4iva, Ma1rkan2d2eya lived for ten
<>crores of years. While he was in deep meditation six
<>Manvantaras passed away. When Ma1rkan2d2eya conti-
<>nued his meditation to the seventh Manvantara Indra
<>got frightened and he made an attempt to abort the
<>penance of Ma1rkan2d2eya. Indra sent his troops of
<>Gandharvas, nymphs, Manmatha and Vasanta to the
<>a1s4rama of Ma1rkan2d2eya. The a1s4rama of Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>was at a place which was on the northern side of the
<>Hima1layas and was famous by the presence there of
<>the river Pus2pabhadra1 and the rock Citra. The agents
<>of Indra came there and tried to entice him with many
<>temptations. Beautiful celestial maidens danced around
<>the a1s4rama. Flowers fell from their hair when their
<>waists shook by the weight of their heavy breasts. En-
<>chanting girls played with balls here and there. As they
<>played the bracelets on their waists fell down and the
<>thin garments that hid their bodies flew up showing an
<>alluring nakedness. Ka1ma (God of Love) sent his arrows
<>at that time against the sage. But Ma1rkan2d2eya sat un-
<>concerned as rigid as a rock and Indra accepted defeat.
<>When Indra and his troops returned disappointed Maha1-
<>vis2n2u with many sages went to Ma1rkan2d2eya. He awoke
<>from his meditation and worshipped Vis2n2u.
<NI>4) {%Vision of Pralaya.%} On one evening at dusk Ma1rkan2-
<>d2eya was sitting at Pus2pabhadra1ti1ra when from some-
<>where a wind began to blow. The wind increased in
<>strength and the sky became covered with clouds. The
<>place resounded with peals of thunder and soon it began
<>to rain. Rains became heavy. Rivers became flooded and
<>water-level in the oceans rose. Everything around was
<>submerged in water and Ma1rkan2d2eya alone stood there
<>with his matted hair swinging in the wind. It was im-
<>possible to know the directions and Ma1rkan2d2eya started
<>walking. He fell into whirlpools but was the next instant
<>thrown up on to the top of surging waves. Then he saw
<>on the top of a high wave a banyan tree. On a branch
<>on the north-east of the tree he saw an infant lying, de-
<>vouring the darkness by its effulgence. He was attracted
<>to the infant by its vital force and went inside the infant
<>as it inhaled. Inside the belly of the kid Ma1rkan2d2eya
<>had a vision of the entire universe. He saw the sky, the
<>horizon, the stars, the oceans, the mountains expanses of
<>land, Suras, Asuras, forests and all that the universe
<>contained in its proper set-up. He saw passing before
<>his eyes the elements, the Yugas and the Manvantaras.
<>After some time he was thrown out by an exhalation of
<>the infant. He stood on the waters. The old banyan
<>tree was still there. An infant was still lying on a leaf on
<>that tree. Ma1rkan2d2eya then knew it was Maha1vis2n2u.
<>He rushed to embrace the child; but the child disappear-
<>ed before he reached it. Ma1rkan2d2eya praised Maha1-
<>vis2n2u.
<NI>5) {%Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara come to Ma1rkan2d2eya.%} When
<>Maha1vis2n2u disappeared from his vision he felt he was
<>sitting at Pus2pabhadra1ti1ra and he again went into
<>meditation. At that time Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara came
<>that way and appeared before Ma1rkan2d2eya. The sage
<>worshipped them and they both blessed Ma1rkan2d2eya [Page489-a+ 64]
<>and said “Every desire of yours will be fulfilled. You
<>will never be rugous or grey-haired and will live virtu-
<>ous and famous till the end of the world. Omniscience
<>will be an asset for you”. After having said so much
<>Pa1rvati1 and Parames4vara disappeared. The Pura1n2ic be-
<>lief is that the realised soul of Ma1rkan2d2eya is moving
<>about in the universe. (10th Skandha, Chapters 8 to 11,
<>Bha1gavata).

<HI>MARUTS. In the Pura1n2as there are references to 49
<>gods who are known as “Maruts”. All of them are
<>the sons of Kas4yapa. The story of how the child in [Page490-a+ 65]
<>Diti's womb was cut into 49 pieces which became 49
<>Maruts. is given in Chapter 71 of Va1mana Pura1n2a as
<>follows:
<NI>Kas4yapa's first wife Aditi became the mother of Devas
<>and his second wife Diti became the mother of Daityas.
<>The chief of the Devas was Indra and the chiefs of
<>Daityas were Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2yakas4ipu. At the
<>request of Indra, Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2yakas4ipu were
<>slain by Maha1vis2n2u. Diti who was grieved at the death
<>of her sons, approached Kas4yapa and requested him
<>to give her a son who would be strong enough to kill
<>Indra. Kas4yapa told her that if she could perform
<>tapas for 10,000 Divyavars2as with due observances,
<>she would get a son who would be able to kill Indra
<>and conquer the three worlds. He gave her a long list
<>of conditions to be observed during the tapas, some of
<>which were as follows:--Do not injure any creature;
<>do not curse; do not tell lies; do not cut nails or hair;
<>do not touch any unclean object; do not get angry, do
<>not speak to wicked people; do not wear soiled clothes;
<>do not wear garlands used by others; do not eat what
<>is left over by another; do not eat meat touched by a
<>S4u1dra woman. Putting on clean, white dress, carrying
<>auspicious substances, everyday before breakfast, cows,
<>Bra1hman2as, goddess Laks2mi1 and Kas4yapa himself
<>should be worshipped.” This observance is known as
<>“Pum3savana.” He said that if she performed the tapas
<>with this austere observance, a son capable of killing
<>Indra would be born to her.
<NI>Diti started the observance as advised by her husband.
<>Kas4yapa left for Udaya mountain. After his departure,
<>Indra came to the A1s4rama and pretending friendship
<>offered to serve Diti as an attendant. Diti accepted his
<>offer and allowed him to serve her. One day Diti who
<>was utterly tired fell asleep and Indra took advantage
<>of this opportunity and gained entrance into her womb
<>through her nostrils. He cut the child in Diti's womb
<>with his weapon Vajra into seven pieces. At that time
<>the child cried aloud and Indra said to it “Ma1 ruda”
<>which means “Do not cry”. He cut each of the seven
<>pieces again into seven pieces and thus 49 Maruts were
<>born out of the 49 pieces. Since Indra said “Ma1 ruda”,
<>they came to be known as “Maruts”. All these
<>Maruts subsequently became Indra's servants.
<NI>After this, Indra with his weapon came out of Diti's
<>body. With joined palms he begged Diti's pardon and
<>explained to her that he destroyed the child in her
<>womb since he was destined to be his (Indra's) enemy.
<HI>MARUTTA I. A wealthy king who lived in Kr2tayuga.
<NI>1). {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order:--Brahma1, Mari1ci, Kas4yapa, Vivasva1n, Vaivas-
<>vata Manu, Maha1ba1hu, Prasandhi, Ks2upa, Iks2va1ku,
<>Vim3s4a, Kalya1n2a, Khani1netra, Suvarcas, Karandhama
<>and Marutta.
<NI>2) {%How Marutta got gold.%} As soon as Marutta became
<>king he began to perform a Ya1ga. Money was required
<>for it. He was puzzled as to how to raise funds. Be-
<>sides, Indra was trying to obstruct the Ya1ga. At last
<>he consulted Na1rada who told him that Br2haspati's
<>brother Sam3vartaka was performing tapas in the forest
<>and if Marutta approached him, he would give him
<>enough money for this purpose. So Marutta went to
<>Sam3vartaka. He advised Marutta to worship S4iva.
<>Accordingly Marutta went to Kaila1sa and got plenty
<>of gold by worshipping S4iva and returned with it and [Page490-b+ 64]
<>began his Ya1ga. In spite of their efforts, Indra and other
<>gods were not able to spoil Marutta's Ya1ga. After the
<>Ya1ga Marutta stored up the surplus wealth in the
<>neighbourhood of Hima1layas where his capital was
<>situated.
<NI>After the Bha1rata Yuddha, Dharmaputra was in need
<>of money to re-establish his administration and for
<>conducting an As4vamedha ya1ga. At that time sage
<>Vya1sa informed him about the gold which Marutta
<>had left in the neighbourhood of the Hima1layas.
<>It was by fetching that gold that the Pa1n2d2avas conduct-
<>ed their As4vamedhaya1ga. (M.B. As4vamedha Parva,
<>Chapters 3-10).
<NI>3) {%Marutta and Ra1van2a.%} Once Ra1van2a started on
<>a triumphal tour in his Pus2paka Vima1na with his
<>followers. It was at that time that Marutta was per-
<>forming his famous Ya1ga. The various gods were also
<>present on that occasion. Alarmed at the sight of
<>Ra1van2a who was invincible by virtue of a boon he had
<>received, the gods assumed the shape of different
<>animals and birds. Indra became a peacock, Dharma-
<>ra1ja (Yama) became a crow; Kubera became a
<>chameleon; Varun2a transformed himself into a swan,
<>and so on. Ra1van2a entered the precincts of the Yajn5a
<>and said to Marutta:--“Either you fight with
<>me, or else admit defeat from me.” To this Marutta
<>replied calmly:--“May I know who you are?”
<>Ra1van2a answered with a smile of contempt:--“I am
<>amused at your strange pretence! Do you mean to say
<>that you do not know Ra1van2a who is the younger
<>brother of Kubera? There is no one but you in all
<>the three worlds, who does not know me. I have won
<>the Pus2pakavima1na after defeating my elder brother.”
<>Marutta retorted with bitter irony:--“As a younger
<>brother who has defeated his elder brother, you are
<>certainly a great man. There is no praiseworthy hero
<>equal to you in all these three worlds. Do you brag
<>that you have defeated your elder brother? I do not
<>know whether you have received the boon by your
<>righteous conduct. I have not heard the stories which
<>you have told just now. You wicked fellow, stop there!
<>I don't think that you will return alive!” Saying
<>this Marutta took his bow and arrows and got ready
<>for a fight.
<NI>But Sam3vartaka stopped Marutta saying “O King!
<>If you would please heed my advice, do not prepare
<>for a fight here. We have started “Mahes4varasatra”.
<>If we do not bring it to a conclusion, the whole family
<>will come to an end. One who performs this Ya1ga
<>should not be engaged in a fight. He should not even
<>become a victim to anger. This Ra1ks2asa (Ra1van2a) is
<>invincible. Your victory is doubtful.” At this,
<>Marutta put down his bow and began to occupy
<>himself again with the affairs of the Yajn5a. Just then
<>S4ukra shouted, “Ra1van2a has won.” The Ra1ks2asas and
<>their leader Ra1van2a continued their tour after eating
<>the Mahars2is who had come to take part in the Ya1ga.
<>After Ra1van2a left the place, the Devas resumed their own
<>forms. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>4) {%Other Details.%}
<NI>(i) Marutta flourished in Yama's assembly. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 8, Verse 16).
<NI>(ii) Marutta is considered as one of the “Pan5camaha1-
<>samra1t2s” (five great emperors). The five great emperors [Page491-a+ 50]
<>are--Yuvana1s4va, Bhagi1ratha, Ka1rtavi1rya, Bharata and
<>Marutta. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 15).
<NI>(iii) Once S4iva presented him a golden peak of the
<>Hima1layas. Indra, Br2haspati and other Devas attended
<>Marutta's assembly. His Yajn5aman2d2apas were all
<>golden. His cooks were groups of Maruts. He was able
<>to make all his subjects strong and healthy. In Ma1ha1-
<>bha1rata, Dron2a Parva, Chapter 55, we see that Marutta
<>ruled over the country for 1000 years as an ideal
<>emperor.
<NI>(iv) Once Marutta received a sword from King Mucu-
<>kunda. Marutta gave it to Raivata. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter, 166, Verse 77).
<NI>(v) Marutta gave his daughter to An3giras and attained
<>Heaven according to Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 234. Verse 18.

<>which says that since Marutta had no sons he had
<>adopted Dus2yanta, a King of the Pu1ru dynasty, as his
<>son.
<HI>MARUTTA II. A great sage. He entered into a
<>dispute with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, who was on his way to Hastina1-
<>pura as the messenger of the Pa1n2d2avas. (M.B. Udyoga
<>Parva, Chapter 83, Verse 27).
<HI>MARUTVA1MALA. In south India, at the southern tip
<>of the Sahya ranges, a mountain reputed for medicinal
<>herbs, may still be seen. This mountain is known by the
<>name “Marutva1mala”. A legend connected with the
<>origin of this mountain, is given in Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>as follows:--
<NI>It was the time of the battle between S4ri1 Ra1ma and
<>Ra1van2a. Ra1van2a's younger brother Vibhi1s2an2a joined
<>the side of Ra1ma and fought against Ra1van2a. The
<>enraged Ra1van2a shot his arrow at Vibhi1s2an2a. In his
<>endeavour to save Vibhi1s2an2a, Laks2man2a fell down
<>unconscious. Ra1ma and his followers discussed how

<>Laks2man2a could be revived. Ja1mbava1n observed that

<>of the Hima1layas and if it was brought at once,
<>Laks2man2a could be restored to his senses. Hanu1ma1n
<>flew to the Hima1layas immediately. But although he
<>combed the forests there, he was not able to find the
<>herb Dron2am. So he tore away and lifted a whole peak
<>which was full of all kinds of medicinal herbs and
<>returned to Lan3ka1. Ja1mbava1n took the needed herbs
<>from it and deposited the peak at the southern end of
<>India. This is the present Marutva1mala. (Mala means

<NI>2). {%What the names of the months indicate.%}
<NI>1). {%Malaya1lam months.%} The months are named based
<>on certain beliefs. It takes twelve months for the earth
<>to go round the Sun once. When the earth passes through
<>the twelve divisions, it faces a separate set of constella-
<>taions in the universe in each of these divisions. In the
<>month of Cin3n3am the earth faces a cluster of constella-
<>tions in the shape of a lion and so the month is called
<>Sim3ha (lion) or Cin3n3am. In the next division the
<>earth faces the constellations in the shape of a Kanyaka1
<>and so the month was called Kanni. The earth faces
<>next the constellations in the shape of a balance and so
<>the month was called Tula1m (Tula1=balance). In the
<>next division the earth faces the constellations in the
<>shape of a scorpion and so the month was called Vr2s4-
<>cikam (scorpion). The set of constellations which faces
<>the earth in the next division is shaped like a bow
<>(dhanus) and so the month got the name Dhanu. In the
<>next division the earth faces a set of constellations in
<>the shape of a Makaramatsya (makara-fish) and so
<>the month was called Makaram. Kumbha means a jar
<>and Mi1nam means a fish and Med2am (Mes2a) means
<>a goat and Id2avam (R2s2abha) means an ox. The shapes
<>of the constellations in those divisions are like the things
<>mentioned and the months were so named after them.
<>In the next two divisions the constellations appear as
<>twins and a crab respectively and the months were so
<>called Mithunam (twins) and Karkat2akam (crab).
<NI>2). {%English months.%}
<NI>i) January has come from the word Janus, the name of
<>a Roman devata1. Janus is twinfaced, one facing the front
<>and the other back.
<NI>ii) February means ‘to purify’ and the festival of purifi-
<>cation of the Romans is conducted in that month.
<NI>iii) March is Mars, a devata1 of War. Rome was built
<>by the brave warrior Romulus. In his time there were
<>only ten months in a year and the number of days
<>in a month varied considerably. There were months
<>with twenty days and thirtyfive days. It was in the
<>year 700 B.C. that the then King of Rome, Numa,
<>divided the year into twelve months and added January
<>and February to it. Till then March was the first month
<>of the year.
<NI>iv) April--Aperio means ‘blossoming’ and since the
<>trees and plants blossom in that month it got the name
<>of April.
<NI>v) May is named after Maia daughter of the demigod
<>(devata1) Atlas. There is an opinion that it is named
<>after Maius, another name of Jupiter.
<NI>vi) June gets its name after the devata1 Juno though there
<>is a version that it is named after a Roman tribe called
<>Junius.
<NI>vii) July was formerly known as Quintilis meaning the
<>fifth counting from March which was the first month of
<>the year till the time of Numa. It was to commemorate
<>the name of Julius Caesar that the name was changed
<>to July.
<NI>viii) August. This month was formerly known as Sex-
<>tilis meaning the sixth month. But it was renamed Aug-
<>ust in honour of Augustus Caesar. But it still lacked
<>the importance of July as it contained thirtyone days and
<>August only thirty days. So Augustus took one day
<>from February and made the number of days in August
<>thirtyone.
<NI>ix) September means the seventh month from March. [Page492-b+ 65]
<NI>x) October means the eighth month.

<NI>(4) All men and women who worship Vis2n2u on the
<>dva1das4i1 day in Vr2s4cikam fasting for the whole day will

<>Parva, Chapter 9, Verse 53.
<HI>MATAN3GA I. An ancient sage. The Ra1ma1yan2a in
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a describes the a1s4rama of Matan3ga.
<>Ra1malaks2man2as after crossing the forest of Kraun5ca
<>came to the a1s4rama of Matan3ga. Kabandha was slain
<>at this place After abandoning his demoniac body
<>Kabandha extolled the greatness of Matan3ga1s4rama
<>to Ra1ma and Laks2man2a. “The flowers of this a1s4rama
<>are never plucked and worn on heads. Even if they are
<>not plucked they never fade. They remain fresh always.
<>There is a reason for this. The disciples of Matan3ga
<>once brought a heavy load of fruits for their guru and
<>when they reached the a1s4rama they were tired and
<>drops of perspiration fell on the plants and they became
<>flowers. S4abari1 is performing penance in this as4rama.”
<>Matan3ga once cursed Ba1li. It happened that while the
<>sage was living on the mountain of R2s2yamu1ka Ba1li and
<>the asura Dundubhi fought against each other and
<>blood flowing from the body of Dundubhi by a blow
<>of Ba1li spurted out and fell on the hands of the sage. [Page493-a+ 64]
<>Matan3ga then cursed Ba1li saying that his head would
<>blow off if he entered R2s2yamu1ka1cala again. (Sarga 46,
<>Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a and Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a, Pu1rva Ka1n2d2a). Matan3ga1s4rama was a holy
<>place. (Chapter 84, Vana Parva).
<HI>MATAN3GA II. Another name of Tris4an3ku. The name of
<>Matan3ga is used for Ra1jars2i Tris4an3ku in Verse 31, of
<>Chapter 71, of A1di Parva. For more detail see under
<>Tris4an3ku.
<HI>MATAN3GA III. A mahars2i born to a barber of a
<>brahmin woman. This clandestine birth was not known
<>either to the brahmin husband or Matan3ga for a long
<>time. Once his brahmin father sent him to the fields
<>for ploughing. He put a donkey to the yoke and plough-
<>ed. When the donkey slowed down its work Matan3ga
<>beat it hard. The mother of the donkey saw it and wept.
<>She called Matan3ga to her side and told him that he
<>was the son of a barber and that was why he behaved
<>like a can2d2a1la showing no kindness to wards the animal.
<>Matan3ga ran to his house and told his parents what
<>the mother-donkey said. After that he left his house
<>and did penance to become a brahmin. Indra was
<>pleased and he asked Matan3ga what he wanted and he
<>replied he wanted to become a brahmin. Indra made
<>him a brahmin and sent him back. (Chapter 27, Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva).
<HI>MATAN3GA IV. A preceptor. He was the guru of S4abari1.
<>(Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MA1TAN3GA Sage Matan3ga was known by this name
<>also. (See under Matan3ga).
<HI>MATAN3GAKEDA1RA. A sacred place. He who bathes
<>in a pond there would get the benefit of making a
<>thousand Goda1nas (Chapter 85, Vana Parva).
<HI>MA1TAN3GI1. The great grandmother of the elephants.
<>Ma1tan3gi1 was the daughter of Krodhavas4a1, daughter of
<>Daks2a and wife of Kas4yapapraja1pati. Ma1tan3gi1 had nine
<>sisters. Elephants were born of Ma1tan3gi1. (Sarga 14,
<>Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a; Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MA1TALI. Charioteer of Indra. Chapter 69 of Va1mana
<>Pura1n2a gives the following story about the birth of
<>Ma1tali.
<NI>A child was born to sage S4ami1ka. It was the time
<>of Deva1sura war. A great army of asuras under the
<>leadership of Andhaka attacked Devaloka and conquer-
<>ed it. In the great battle with Andhaka the Vajra1-
<>yudha of Indra broke into two. Indra was thinking of a
<>new weapon for him. Maha1vis2n2u then appeared before
<>him and advised him to praise the glory of Agni. Indra
<>did so and then a divine weapon rose from the fire.
<>Indra flew at the asuras carrying the new weapon.
<>There was no clever charioteer to drive the chariot of
<>Indra. Still, seated in the golden chariot given to
<>him by the Vasus Indra drove very swiftly against the
<>asuras. The earth shivered by the din of the chariot-
<>wheels.
<NI>When the earth began to quake the sage S4ami1ka follow-
<>ing directions of his wife Tapasvini1 placed the child
<>on the ground outside the hermitage. An astrologer had
<>told her that a child would become two if it was
<>placed in an open ground at the time of earth-quake.
<>Tapasvini1 wanted one more child. As soon as her child
<>was placed on the ground another child identical in
<>every respect with the first one was born by the side of
<>the other. But the second child, as soon as it [Page493-b+ 64]
<>was born rose up and ran to Indra for driving his
<>chariot.
<NI>When the Gandharvas knew he was coming to help
<>Indra, they showered him with brilliance and the child
<>approaching Indra said “Oh, Lord of the Devas, I
<>shall be your charioteer.” Indra asked him, “Child,
<>whose son are you? How will you drive my horse? I
<>doubt your competence.” The child replied, “I am the
<>son born to S4ami1ka on the ground. I have been given
<>power and brilliance by the Gandharvas and so I am
<>capable of driving your chariot.” On hearing this, Indra
<>accepted him as his charioteer and named him Ma1tali.
<HI>MA1TARIS4VAN. A devata1 (demigod). There are
<>several stories in the Vedas regarding the birth of Agni
<>(fire). Though Agni originating from the clouds rea-
<>ches the earth as lightning it hides itself making it invisi-
<>ble to man. It was Ma1taris4van who took its form from
<>the earth and gave it to the Bhr2gu family and made it
<>possible for them to make it as and when it was requir-
<>ed. (R2gveda).
<NI>This Ma1taris4van was one of the prominent sons of
<>Garud2a. (S4loka 14, Chapter 10, Udyoga Parva).

<>be the author of the book Sa1n3khyaka1rika1vr2tti. (Kaus2i1-
<>taki1 Bra1hman2a).
<HI>MA1T2HARAVANA. A holy place in Daks2in2a Bha1rata.

<>situated here. (S4loka 10, Chapter 88, Vana Parva).
<HI>MATHURA1. The birth place of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<HI>MATI. A daughter of Daks2apraja1pati. She became the
<>wife of Dharmara1ja. (S4loka 15, Chapter 66, A1di
<>Parva).
<HI>MATINA1RA. A King of Puruvam3s4a. The line from Pu1ru
<>is as follows: Pu1ru-Janamejaya-Pra1cinva1n-Manasyu-
<>Vi1tabhaya-S4un2d2u-Bahuvidha-Sam3ya1ti-Rahova1di1-
<>Bhadra1s4va-R2ks2eyu-Kr2s2eyu-Sannateyu-Ghr2teyu-Sthan2-

<>83, Vana Parva).
<HI>MATSYA I. The first and foremost incarnation of Maha1-
<>vis2n2u. (See under Avata1ra).
<HI>MATSYA II. An ancient country of Pura1n2ic fame. The
<>people of this country are called Matsyas. The details
<>available regarding Matsyades4a from the Maha1bha1rata

<>attendants. (Chapter 278, Agni Pura1n2a).
<HI>MATSYAPURA1N2A. One of the eighteen Pura1n2as. This
<>Pura1n2a was told to Manu Satyavrata by Maha1vis2n2u
<>during his incarnation as Matsyu. There are thirteen
<>thousand s4lokas in it. For prosperity this Pura1n2a should
<>be given as gift on the Vis2uvat day along with a golden

<>Ra1van2a returning after his victory march came that way.
<>Seeing the sage sitting in a wonderfully queer posture [Page494-b+ 65]
<>Ra1van2a was amused and playfully tapped the staff
<>with his Candraha1sa. The staff broke into two and
<>Maudgalya fell flat on the ground breaking his spine.
<>The sage was furious and he cursed Ra1van2a saying
<>that his Candraha1sa would thenceforth have no effect
<>at all. (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>MAUHU1RTTIKA1GATI. When the Sun passes through

<>Sus4arma1, King of Trigarta, fought against Arjuna
<>taking along with him the warriors of Ma1vellaka. Arjuna
<>killed them all. (S4loka 20, Chapter 17, Dron2a Parva).
<HI>MAYA. A Da1nava king who served Devas and Asuras
<>as their architect and builder.
<NI>1) {%General.%} Kas4yapa Praja1pati, son of Mari1ci and
<>grandson of Brahma1 married the thirteen daughters of
<>Daks2a. Among them, the first was Aditi, the second
<>was Diti and the third was Danu. A1diteyas were born
<>to Aditi, Daityas were born to Diti and Da1navas were
<>born to Danu. The chief among the sons of Danu
<>was Maya.
<NI>Maya was found to be very proficient in the art of archi-
<>tecture even from his boyhood. He worshipped Brahma1
<>in the Hima1layas to gain unrivalled skill in architecture
<>Brahma1 was pleased and appeared before him. He
<>blessed Maya to become the unequalled architect of the
<>Devas. Asuras and Da1navas. After that Maya was en-
<>gaged in building magnificent mansions for Devas and
<>Asuras. He was also anointed King of the Da1navas.
<NI>It was a period of friendly co-operation and brotherly
<>relations between Devas and Asuras. Once there was a
<>dancing show in Devaloka. Maya was also invited to
<>see the performance of the women of Devaloka. All the
<>dancers acquitted themselves creditably. But what
<>attracted Maya most, was the dance of Hema1, the
<>Apsara1 woman. Maya and Hema1 were mutually
<>attracted and fell in love with each other. The Devas
<>who came to know of this, gave Hema1 in marriage to
<>Maya. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Domestic life.%} Maya and Hema1 went to the valley
<>south of Himava1n and built there a city named “Hema-
<>pura”. While leading a happy life there, two sons,
<>Ma1ya1vi1 and Dundubhi were born to them. But they had
<>no daughter. So they worshipped S4iva, praying for a
<>daughter.
<NI>At about that time, one day, an Apsara1 woman,
<>Madhura1, after observing Somava1ra Vrata, came to
<>S4iva and did obeisance to him. Pa1rvati1 was not at home
<>at the moment. Fascinated by Madhura1's charm, S4iva
<>embraced her. Pa1rvati1 who came to know of it, cursed [Page495-a+ 65]
<>Madhura1 and turned her into a frog. But she said that
<>after twelve years, the curse would be lifted and she
<>would become a woman again. It was in a well near
<>the place where Maya and Hema1 were performing tapas
<>that Madhura1 fell as frog. After twelve years, the frog
<>recovered her former shape as a woman. At that time
<>Maya saw her, and taking her to be the daughter
<>given to him by S4iva, took her with him to his palace.
<>He gave her the name “Mandodari1”. It was this
<>“Mandodari1” whom Ra1van2a married later.
<NI>Besides these three children, Maya had some other
<>sons and daughters. In Devi1 Bha1gavata, 8th Skandha
<>there is a reference to the Da1nava named Bala, the son
<>of Maya, living in Atala, a section of Pa1ta1la. In Katha1
<>saritsa1gara, Madanaman5cuka1lambaka, 3rd Taran3ga we
<>find that Maya had two daughters named Svayam-
<>prabha1 and Somaprabha1. Of them, Somaprabha1 was
<>married by Nalaku1bara, the son of Vais4ravan2a.
<NI>3) {%Alliance with Arjuna and construction of Indraprastha.%}
<>Once Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna offered Kha1n2d2avavana to Agni-
<>deva as a feast. (See under the word “Kha1n2d2avada1ha”).
<>While Agni was furiously feeding upon the forests, the
<>human and animal inhabitants in it began to flee from
<>it. Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna shot them down with arrows. At
<>that time Maya was hiding himself in the disguise of
<>Taks2aka. When the flames of fire approached that place
<>Maya left his shelter and rushed out. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a aimed
<>his weapon Cakra at him. Crying aloud with fear,
<>Maya ran to Arjuna praying for protection. Arjuna
<>stopped Agnideva and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and thus saved Maya.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 240).
<NI>From that time, Maya became a loyal follower of
<>Arjuna. After Kha1n2d2avada1ha, Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna were
<>taking rest when Maya approached them with joined
<>palms and asked Arjuna what he should do in return
<>for saving him from the fury of Kr2s2n2a and the blazing
<>fire. Arjuna replied that he expected no return from
<>Maya for saving his life but wanted only his friend-
<>ship. Maya was not satisfied. He insisted that Arjuna
<>should accept some service from him as a token of his
<>deep gratitude. On hearing this, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a suggested
<>that Maya should build a beautiful palace for
<>the Pa1n2d2avas. Accordingly he built a magnificent
<>palace for the Pa1n2d2avas at the place called Kha1n2d2ava-
<>prastha. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 1).
<NI>4) {%Maya settled down in Vindhya.%} Once Maya sought
<>shelter from Maha1vis2n2u. Vis2n2u offered shelter to Maya
<>and so he built a mansion called “Sudharma1” for all
<>the Devas. It was a building of inexpressible beauty and
<>rare architectural workmanship. The Asuras who
<>became angry with Maya for his allianee with the Devas
<>made preparations to attack him. Alarmed at it, Maya
<>fled southwards with his family and reached Vindhya.
<>There he built a lovely mansion and settled down in it.
<>(Katha1s4aritsa1gara, Madanaman5cuka1lambaka, 3rd
<>Taran3ga).
<NI>In Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Kis2kindha1 ka1n2d2a, 50th sarga
<>also there is a reference to this wonderful mansion
<>which Maya built on the Vindhya mountain. In their
<>search for Si1ta1, Hanu1ma1n and the other monkeys
<>reached the Vindhya mountain. There they combed the
<>forests and caves to find out Si1ta1. When they cam3e to
<>the peak to the south west of the mountain, they saw a
<>huge dark cave. They entered it and cautiously moved
<>forward. After a long and tedious walk the monkeys [Page495-b+ 64]
<>were exhausted with hunger and thirst. When they
<>proceeded a little further, they came across a bright
<>place. There they saw a woman sitting alone, dressed
<>in deer skin and barks of trees. She greeted them and
<>in the course of her talk with the monkeys she told
<>them that the cave was made by the magician Maya
<>and that her name was Svayamprabha1. Her mother was
<>Merusa1varn2i1 and that she (Svayamprabha1) was entrust-
<>ed with the task guarding the wonderful mansion.
<>Then she gave them fruits and fresh water.
<NI>5) {%Building of Tripuras.%} It was Maya who built three
<>magic dwellings for the three Da1navas, Kamala1ks2a,
<>Ta1raka1ks2a and Vidyunma1li1. (For details see under the
<>word Pura).
<NI>6) {%Other details.%}
<NI>(i) Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 227, Verse 41
<>says that Namuci the Da1nava was the brother of Maya.
<NI>(ii) Maya had two sons named Suni1tha and Sudan2d2ika
<>They became human beings under a curse. (For details
<>see under the word Su1ryaprabha1).
<NI>(iii) In Katha1saritsa1gara Madanaman5cuka1lambaka,
<>8th Taran3ga we see that Maya was an incarnation of
<>Vis4vakarma1.
<NI>(iv) At the time when Maha1vis2n2u as Va1mana took the
<>three worlds from Maha1bali, Maya joined with other
<>Da1navas and fought against Va1mana. (M.B. Bhavis2ya
<>Parva, Chapter 55).
<NI>(v) Once Maya was relaxing with his friends on the
<>Malaya mountain. Knowing about it Mahes4vara sent
<>Indra to that mountain. Indra challenged the Da1navas
<>for a fight. In the battle that followed, Indra killed the
<>Da1nava named Pa1ka. Thus he got the name, “Pa1ka-
<>s4a1sana”. Indra killed Pura, the son of Maha1bali also in
<>that battle and so came to be known as “Purandara”
<>The remaining Da1navas under the leadership of Maya
<>fled to Pa1ta1la. (Va1mana Pura1n2a, Chapter 71).
<HI>MA1YA1.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A consort of Maha1vis2n2u, Ma1ya1
<>has got a very prominent place in Hindu Pura1n2as. The
<>Pura1n2as state that this whole universe is unreal, illusory
<>and if we feel it real it is because of the working of this
<>Ma1ya1.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} How was Ma1ya1 born? Agni Pura1n2a in its
<>twentieth chapter gives a genealogy of Ma1ya1. Him3sa1
<>(injury) is the wife of Adharma (evil). They got two
<>children named Anr2ta (falsehood) and Nikr2ti (wicked-
<>ness). From them were born Bhaya (fear), Naraka (hell)
<>Ma1ya1 (illusion) and Vedana1 (pain). Ma1ya1 in turn gave
<>birth to Death, the destroyer of all pain produced from
<>Hate or Misery. Mr2tyu (death) produced Vya1dhi
<>(disease), Jara1 (rugosity), S4oka (sorrow), Tr2s2n2a1 (desire)
<>and Krodha (anger).
<NI>3) {%Exhibition of Ma1ya1.%} Maha1vis2n2u once told Na1rada thus:
<>“There is nothing like living beings on earth. All is an
<>illusion due to Ma1ya1.” Na1rada requested Maha1vis2n2u
<>to show him that and Vis2n2u took Na1rada to the banks
<>of a river and exhibited the wonderful working of
<>Ma1ya1. (For details see under Ta1ladhvaja I).
<NI>4) {%How Ga1thi, a brahmin, saw Ma1ya1.%} In the country
<>of Kosala there was once a brahmin named Ga1thi.
<>He went to the forests and standing there in water in
<>a pond, immersed up to his neck, started doing penance.
<>For eight months he did penance thus and then Maha1-
<>vis2n2u appeared before him and asked him what boon [Page496-a+ 64]
<>he wanted. The brahmin said he wanted to see Ma1ya1-
<>devi1. Vis2n2u granted the boon and disappeared.
<NI>Several years passed after that and nothing happened.
<>One day the brahmin as usual went to bathe in a pond.
<>When he took a dip in the waters he forgot all his
<>prayers and mantras. There was a change of mind. He
<>felt he was lying dead in his house. Relatives were
<>sitting around weeping. His wife was in tears and was
<>holding his legs. In an atmosphere of mourning, his own
<>people weeping bitterly carried his body to a frightening
<>burial ground and put it on a funeral pyre. It was burnt
<>to ashes. He then felt himself in the womb af a Can2d2a1la
<>woman living in a village near Hu1n2aman2d2ala. The
<>foetus developed and a black boy was born. The boy
<>grew passing the stages of infancy, childhood and boy-
<>hood and became a man, black and stout. He started
<>enjoying sexual life with a beautiful can2d2a1la girl. The
<>amorous plays were done on leaf-beds, in creeper-huts,
<>bushes and in caves and soon many evil-natured sons
<>were born to him. Gradually his health faded and he
<>constructed a hermitage and lived there as a hermit.
<>His children grew up and he became old and then all
<>on a sudden all his children and wife and other
<>members of his family died and he was left alone. He
<>then left the place and travelling much reached the
<>capital city of Ki1raman2d2ala. The city gates were deco-
<>rated and inside people stood in groups. The road to
<>the palace from the gate had been beautified and as he
<>reached the palace gates he saw an elephant as big and
<>black as mountain standing there well caparisoned. It
<>was customary in those days to post an elephant well
<>bedecked before the palace gates when a King died.
<>The elephant he saw was one who had been let loose
<>to select a new King in the place of the one who had
<>just died. The elephant on seeing him took him by its
<>trunk and placed him on its back. The people when
<>they saw it shouted “The King”, “The King”. Drums
<>were beaten and people shouted with joy. He was
<>taken to the palace where he was received by young
<>and beautiful girls. He was dressed in royal robes and
<>he took over the administration of the state. Gradually
<>he accepted as his wives the wives of the former King
<>and lived there accepting the name of Ga1lava. He
<>ruled the state to the satisfaction of all for eight
<>years. One day the King went out for a stroll dressed
<>as an ordinary man. Just outside the gate of the palace
<>a set of Can2d2a1las were sitting singing songs to the
<>accompaniment of a violin. As soon as they saw Ga1lava
<>one of the Can2d2a1las, a red-eyed old man, got up from
<>the group and addressing the King as “Hi, Kalan5ju”
<>shouted loudly, “Friend, where had you been all this
<>time? It is a long time since we saw you. It is our luck
<>we saw you at least now”. The King of Ki1ra did not
<>like the words of the Can2d2a1la and he rebuked the old
<>man. The queens and others standing on the terrace of
<>the palace could see this scene. They were shocked. They
<>regretted they had all along been serving a Can2d2a1la.
<>The news spread like wild fire in the state. The King
<>had to live in the palace without the help and co-oper-
<>ation of anybody inside or outside the palace.
<NI>People wanted to atone for the crime they had commit-
<>ted in installing a Can2d2a1la as their King. They made
<>small firepits throughout the country and started
<>committing suicide by jumping into it. The King [Page496-b+ 65]
<>lamented that such a mass suicide was due to him and
<>he also made a fire-pit and jumped into it.
<NI>The heat of the fire-pit woke him from his day-dream
<>and Ga1thi found himself in the pond where he had
<>come to bathe. “What! Who am I? What all roles did
<>I take just now?” These puzzling thoughts filled him
<>and he went back to the a1s4rama and started life as
<>usual. One day an old friend of his came to the a1s4rama
<>and after the daily routine they lay down to sleep.
<>During their conversation Ga1thi1 asked his friend why
<>he had become fleshless and so lean. Then his friend
<>narrated a story exactly similar to the experiences
<>which Ga1thi had in the country of Ki1ra. He added
<>that to atone for the sin of his association with the
<>Can2d2a1las he was conducting Praya1gasna1na (bath in
<>Praya1ga), Japa and Ca1ndra1yan2amaha1vrata. All those
<>things he explained, made him lean.
<NI>Ga1thi knew that the story of the guest related to him
<>and he was eager to visit the country of Ki1ra. When he
<>went to Ki1ra he saw everything there in the same way
<>as in his dream. Then he realised that it was an ex-
<>hibition by Vis2n2u of the working of Ma1ya1. Ga1thi then
<>renounced everything and went into a cave and started
<>doing penance there. After some years Maha1 Vis2n2u
<>appeared before him and blessed him. (Jn5a1nava1sis2t2ha).

<>in Maha1bha1rata. Chapters 227 to 233 of A1di Parva,
<>are included.
<HI>MA1YA1DHARA. An asura. Indra got down Puru1ravas
<>to fight against this demon who was always giving
<>trouble to the devas. Puru1ravas killed Ma1ya1dhara in a
<>battle. The day the demon was killed Indra gave a
<>banquet in honour of Puru1ravas. After the banquet
<>there was a dance performance by Rambha1 and as she
<>was dancing before A1ca1rya Tumburu, Puru1ravas openly
<>criticised Rambha1 for the mistake in dancing she
<>committed then. Tumburu did not relish it and he
<>cursed Puru1ravas saying that Puru1ravas would bear a
<>separation from his wife Urvas4i1. It was because of this
<>curse that Urvas4i1 was once carried away from the palace
<>of Puru1ravas by the Gandharvas. (Katha1saritsa1gara,
<>Taran3ga 3, La1va1n2akalambaka).
<HI>MA1YA1MR2GA. Ma1ri1ca, uncle of Ra1van2a, took the form
<>of a beautiful deer to tempt Si1ta1 and went to the
<>a1s4rama where Si1ta1 was staying. This deer is called
<>Ma1ya1mr2ga. (See under MA1RI1CA).
<HI>MA1YA1PURI1. A city of the asuras. (See under Kraun5ca).
<HI>MA1YA1SI1TA1. When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were in exile
<>in the forests with Si1ta1, Ra1van2a came to carry away
<>Si1ta1. At that time the real Si1ta1 disappeared in Agni
<>and in her place a false Si1ta1 was installed. It was this
<>phantom Si1ta1 who was carried away by Ra1van2a and
<>who lived in Lan3ka1 till the time of Ra1van2a's death. It
<>was this Ma1ya1si1ta1 whom Ra1ma asked to jump into the
<>fire to test her purity. At that time Ma1ya1si1ta1 disap-
<>peared and the real Si1ta1 came out from the fire. (See
<>under SI1TA1).
<HI>MA1YA1S4IVA. Padma Pura1n2a gives a story of how once an
<>asura named Jalandhara approached Pa1rvati1 as S4iva to
<>induce her to surrender to his desires. This S4iva was
<>called Ma1ya1s4iva.
<NI>A great battle between the devas and asuras was going
<>on. The asuras were winning and the devas got frighten-
<>ed at the strength of the asuras and so S4iva himself
<>entered the battlefield. Jalandhara who led the army of [Page497-a+ 65]
<>the asuras found the fight against S4iva very tough and
<>smelt defeat. He decided to cheat Pa1rvati1, the consort
<>of S4iva, to compensate for his defeat in the battle-field
<>and so making an asura named S4umbha as the chief,
<>he left for Kaila1sa. S4umbha became a ma1ya1 Jalandhara
<>and continued the fight.
<NI>Taking another asura named Durva1ran2a, Jalandhara
<>went to a cave in Kaila1sa and there changed himself
<>into an exact replica of S4iva. He made Durva1ran2a look
<>like Nandikes4a.
<NI>Then they went to the top of the mountain where Pa1r-
<>vati1 and her companions were staying. S4iva approached
<>Pa1rvati1 on the shoulders of Nandikes4a with wounds all
<>over his body and blood oozing from them. Pa1rvati1
<>seeing S4iva thus, with tears rolling down her cheeks
<>asked him, “Oh, Lord of the gods what happened to
<>your lordship? Who defeated you in the battle? Why
<>do you weep like a low-bred man?” Ma1ya1s4iva took
<>from his body all his ornaments like Va1suki and gave
<>them to the companions of Pa1rvati1. When Pa1rvati1 saw
<>the heads of Gan2apati and Subrahman2ya in the hands
<>of her husband she cried in bitterness. S4iva told her
<>that all his pa1rs2adas like Man2ibhadra, Vi1rabhadra,
<>Pus2padanta, Damana, Dhu1mata1mra and Ku1s2ma1n2d2a
<>were killed in the battle. Can2d2i1, Bhr2n3gi1, Kiri1t2i1, Maha1-
<>ka1la, S4r2n3khali1, Can2d2i1s4a and Guptanetra were all killed.
<>Ma1ya1s4iva told her that he had picked up the heads of
<>Gan2apati and Subrahman2ya found lying in the battle-
<>field. He requested Pa1rvati1 to console him by embracing
<>him. Pa1rvati1 resented the request. She said, “What
<>you say is unfit for the situation. Sexual enjoyment is
<>forbidden in times of misery, fear, meditation, vomiting
<>fever, performing offering to the manes, journey, royal
<>visits, marriage festivities and in the presence of elders
<>and teachers. Why do you make this request to me
<>when I am mourning the death of my sons?
<NI>Pretending to be grief-stricken Ma1ya1s4iva said “She who
<>does not give sexual pleasure to a man in distress would
<>go to hell. I have no pa1rs2adas now. I have lost my
<>sons also. I lost my house. Now you also hate me. I am
<>going to my cave. Let me end my life there. Come
<>on, Nandikes4a, Vajra, we will go.
<>Hearing this Pa1rvati1 went near him.
<NI>At this time there happened a few bad omens in the
<>ocean of milk where Vis2n2u was residing, and calling
<>Garud2a to his side Vis2n2u asked him to go and enquire
<>about the battle that was going on between the devas and
<>asuras. To prevent him from being deceived by the magic
<>of the asuras Vis2n2u dropped into the mouth of Garud2a
<>a pill of great potency. Garud2a reached the battlefield
<>very soon but could not find anything out of the way
<>and so flew to Kaila1sa. He did not see Pa1rvati1 first but
<>hearing a noise from somewhere else peeped in and
<>saw Ma1ya1s4iva. Garud2a could understand him because of
<>the power of the pill and so flew swiftly back to Maha1-
<>vis2n2u and told him what he saw.
<NI>Maha1vis2n2u knew that Pa1rvati1 had been deceived by
<>Jalandhara. So he decided to cheat Vr2nda1, wife of
<>Jalandhara. Maha1vis2n2u filled with amorous desires,
<>avoiding Maha1laks2mi1, covering his head with a
<>yellow scarf and taking the figure of another person by
<>his yogic powers stepped out of his abode taking Ananta
<>for his company. He went to Durga1ka1nana the abode
<>of Vr2nda1. They constructed an a1s4rama there and the
<>wild animals like the lion, tiger, boar, bear and monkey [Page497-b+ 64]
<>became their disciples taking human form. Then Vis2n2u
<>created mental agony in Vr2nda1 to attract her to his
<>a1s4rama. Vr2nda1 started getting hot and her maids
<>fanned her continuously and anointed her with sandal-
<>wood paste. She thought of her husband in the battle-
<>field and often fainted. She had a very bad dream. She
<>saw her husband Jalandhara lying wounded on his
<>head, ears and nose, with his body smeared with ashes
<>and his eyes pecked by vultures. She saw Ka1li1, with her
<>hair lying lose, her face reddened with blood, with a
<>skull in her hand dancing before the body of her hus-
<>band before starting to eat it. At this moment she was
<>awakened by the music of the Ma1gadhas and loud
<>chanting of family praises by Kimpurus2as. She at once
<>stopped the music and prayers and paid them off. Then
<>she sent word for pandits to explain the dream she saw.
<>The Pandits said “Devi1, this appears to be a dream
<>giving unimaginable fear. To calm the fear give as gifts
<>to brahmins, diamonds, garments, cows and elephants.”
<>Then the brahmin pandits sprinkled on her, water made
<>potent by mantras. There was no waning of the fever.
<>Dismissing the pandits, queen Vr2nda1 went and sat
<>alone upstairs. She felt the whole palace burning and
<>by the craft employed by Vis2n2u she found living inside
<>the palace unbearable.
<NI>She got out of the palace and boarding a chariot drawn
<>by mares she went to her play-garden. The sight of
<>the garden filled with beautiful flowers and celestial
<>maidens where no one else but pleasing breeze could
<>enter made her remember her husband. She then
<>brooded on how to find out Jalandhara, and there also
<>she did not get peace of mind. So she accompanied
<>by her maids started for another garden. That garden
<>gave a ghastly sight with huge trees standing crowded
<>interspersed with black rocks and the place resounding
<>with the roars of lions and tigers. Vr2nda1 got frightened
<>and she hastened to say “Smaradu1ti1, I feel frightened.
<>Please drive back the chariot home.”
<NI>Hearing this Smaradu1ti1 said, “Oh, Devi1, I do not know
<>the place. I do not understand the directions also. To
<>which direction am I to drive? The horses look tired.
<>There is no way here. Anyhow let it go as directed by
<>God. If we stay here we will be eaten by man-eaters.”
<>So saying the maid drove the chariot and soon they
<>reached a forest more grisly than the former. It was a
<>forest where great yogins lived. There was no light
<>there neither water nor wind. No sound came. Even
<>the sounds of the bells on the horses and the chariot
<>stopped. Vr2nda1 moaned, “Where are we to go now,
<>maid! There is no peace of mind for me anywhere in
<>this world.”
<NI>Smaradu1ti1 looking ahead cried, “Look Devi1, there is a
<>great black mountain in front of us. The horses refuse
<>to move, for they are afraid of it.”
<NI>Cold with fear the queen stood up from the chariot and
<>keeping her hands on the pearl necklace on her breast
<>jumped out of the chariot. Then a very fierce demon
<>came towards them. He was yellow in colour with three
<>legs, five hands, seven eyes and ears like a tiger's and
<>the shoulders and chin like those of a lion. It was a
<>horrible sight and Vr2nda1 hid her eyes with her hands
<>and trembled like a plantain leaf. The maid jumping
<>out of the chariot cried aloud “Oh, my queen, help me.
<>This demon is going to eat me.” The demon approaching [Page498-a+ 65]
<>them took the chariot with the horses and whirled it
<>round in the air. Both the queen and the maid fainted
<>at this exhibition of strength. The demon ate all the
<>horses and then catching hold of the hands of the queen
<>he roared, “If you want your life make me your husband.
<>Your husband has been killed by S4iva in the battle. If
<>you join me you can live for years together without
<>fear. Come on, drink this sweet liquor with flesh”.
<>Vr2nda1 became half dead when she heard that.
<NI>At that time Maha1vis2n2u in the guise of an ascetic
<>wearing barks of trees and matted hair appeared
<>before them. An angered look form Vis2n2u sent the
<>demon away from the place. Vr2nda1 took refuge in the
<>ascetic and the false ascetic said, “I am Devas4arma1, son
<>of Bharadva1ja. Renouncing all worldly pleasures I have
<>come here to do penance and if it pleases you, you can
<>come and stay in my a1s4rama and do penance. We can
<>go to another forest far away from here.” As soon as
<>they reached the a1s4rama Maha1vis2n2u appeared before
<>her in the figure of Jalandhara. They embraced each
<>other and lived there joyfully for many days. One day
<>at the end of a sexual act Vr2nda1 saw instead of Jalan-
<>dhara the ascetic in embrace with her. She was shocked
<>and stood up separated from him. Then Maha1vis2n2u
<>said “Vr2nda1, I am Vis2n2u husband of Laks2mi1. Your
<>husband has gone to conquer S4iva and get Parvati1 for
<>himself. I am S4iva also. We appear separate. Your hus-
<>band Jalandhara has been killed in the battle. Join with
<>me.”
<NI>Vr2nda1 got angry. She cursed Vis2n2u ; she said, “You
<>cheated me by pretendiug to be an ascetic. Let your
<>wife also be once cheated by a false ascetic.” The
<>cursed Vis2n2u disappeared and Vr2nda1 started penance.
<>Many Gandharva ladies came with temptations to dis-
<>suade Vr2nda1 from continuing the penance. But all such
<>attempts failed and Vr2nda1 ended her life doing penance.
<NI>The nymphs showered flowers on her from above and
<>the dead body of Vr2nda1 was cremated by Smaradu1ti1
<>and Smaradu1ti1 jumped into the funeral pyre of Vr2nda1
<>and gave away her life. The nymphs made an image of
<>her with the ashes from the funeral pyre and floated it
<>on the river Gan3ga1.
<NI>Pa1rvati1 did not consent to having any sexual enjoyment
<>with Ma1ya1s4iva and she escaped from the place and went
<>to A1ka1s4agan3ga1 and started doing penance there. One day
<>Pa1rvati1 called her maid Jaya1 to her side and said “Jaya1
<>you go in my dress to S4iva and find out whether he is
<>really S4iva or not. If he kisses you and embraces you he
<>will surely be a da1nava come in disguise by his Ma1ya1.
<>But if he asks you about my welfare he will be real S4iva.
<>Go and tell me what happens.”
<NI>Jaya1 went to Ma1ya1s4iva. Jalandhara when he saw her
<>mistook her for Pa1rvati1 and caught hold of her and
<>immediately semen flowed out from him. Jaya1 returned
<>and told Pa1rvati1 that it was Jalandhara and not S4iva.
<>Pa1rvati1 afraid of Jalandhara hid in a lotus and her
<>companions became beetles sitting on the lotus. In the
<>meantime the guards of the palace finding the queen
<>absent from the palace reported the matter to S4umbha
<>fighting against S4iva. He sent Can2d2amun2d2as to Jalan-
<>dhara to inform him of the situation. Jalandhara-came
<>back to the battle-field running and took up the fight
<>against S4iva again.
<HI>MA1YA1SURA. An asura. He had a daughter named
<>Somaprabha1. (Katha1saritsa1gara). [Page498-b+ 65]
<HI>MA1YA1VASIS2T2HA. There was once a King called Mitra-
<>saha among the Kings of the Solar dynasty who ruled
<>Ayodhya1. One day while he was hunting he saw two
<>demons roaming about as tigers and Mitrasaha killed
<>one of them. The other demon waited for an opportu-
<>nity to wreak vengeance and an opportunity presented
<>itself. Mitrasaha was conducting an As4vamedha ya1ga to
<>which Vasis2t2ha was the chief priest. The demon went
<>to the King as Vasis2t2ha and privately told him that
<>he desired to eat meat and the King accordingly pre-
<>pared meat which was greatly resented by the real
<>Vasis2t2ha and the sage cursed Mitrasaha to become a
<>demon. The false Vasis2t2ha who played the trick on the
<>King is called Ma1ya1vasis2t2ha. (See for details under
<>Kalma1s2apa1da).
<HI>MA1YA1VATI1. An incarnation of Ratidevi1. An asura
<>named S4ambara made her his wife. But Pradyumna,
<>son of Kr2s2n2a, carried her away to Dva1raka1. (See under
<>Pradyumna).
<HI>MA1YA1VI1. An asura.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Ma1ya1vi1 was born to the great architect of
<>the Da1navas, Maya, of his wife Hema1, a nymph. Maya
<>fell in love with Hema1 when he once found her dancing
<>in Devaloka and the devas coming to know of it gave her
<>in marriage to Maya. Maya took Hema1 to the southern
<>side of the Hima1layas and constructing a city there
<>called Hemapura stayed there happily. They got two
<>sons named Ma1ya1vi1 and Dundubhi. (Uttara Ra1ma1-
<>yan2a).
<NI>2) {%Death.%} Valorous Ma1ya1vi1 fought against anybody and
<>everybody. He once challenged Ba1li to a fight. But the
<>mighty blows of Ba1li were unbearable to him and the
<>defeated Ma1ya1vi1 ran away from Ba1li and hid himself
<>in a big cave. Ba1li followed him and when he reached
<>the mouth of the cave he posted his brother Sugri1va
<>there with instructions to shut tight the opening of the
<>cave in case he died in the cave in the fight. He said
<>that if blood flowed from the cave the dead person was
<>Ma1ya1vi1 and if milk flowed from the cave the dead person
<>was himself. In the cave a great fight ensued in which
<>Ma1ya1vi1 was killed. But Ma1ya1vi1 by his powers of magic
<>made the blood that flowed out look like milk for
<>Sugri1va and the latter thinking that it was his brother
<>who was killed shut tight the mouth of the cave and went
<>his way. (Sarga 9, Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a
<>and Pu1rva Ka1n2d2a, Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a.
<HI>MAYIL (PEACOCK). In Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a there is
<>a story about how the peacock got its beauty. Mayil in
<>Malaya1lam means peacock.
<NI>Once Ra1van2a set out in his Pus2paka Vima1na with his
<>army of Ra1ks2asas, determined to gain victory over all
<>Kings. They got down on the mountain called Us4i1ravi1ra.
<>Ra1van2a examined the valley to see whether there were
<>any Kings doing tapas anywhere there. A King named
<>Marutta was performing a ya1ga called “Ma1hes4vara” in
<>an a1s4rama. Indra and other gods were also present to
<>receive the share of offerings (Havirbha1ga). At the sight
<>of Ra1van2a, the gods took different disguises and fled
<>in panic. At that time Indra assumed the form of a big
<>peacock. As soon as Ra1van2a left the place, the gods re-
<>assembled there. From that time, Indra who put on the
<>disguise of a peacock felt a special attachment to that
<>bird. He called the peacock and said:--“Till now you
<>were blue in colour. But from today onwards, your
<>feathers will have various colours. All my thousand eyes [Page499-a+ 65]
<>I transfer to you Besides, you will be immune from all
<>diseases. Whoever kills you, will meet with death, soon
<>after. You will dance at the commencement of the rainy
<>season. People will greet you with enthusiasm.”
<NI>It is because of Indra's blessing that Peacocks are so
<>beautiful in appearance and dance at the onset of the
<>rainy season.
<HI>MAYU1RA. An asura who fought against Subrahman2ya.
<>Skanda Pura1n2a, Vi1ramahendra Ka1n2d2a describes the
<>terrible battle between Mayu1ra and Subrahman2ya.
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65 says that after
<>death, Mayu1ra was reborn in the world as a King named
<>Vis4va.
<HI>MAYU1RADHVAJA. A King of Ratnanagara. After per-
<>forming seven As4vamedha ya1gas this King started
<>another As4vamedha in the Narmada1 river valley. The
<>task of protecting the sacrificial horse was undertaken
<>by the King's son Sucitra or Ta1mradhvaja. He set out
<>for the conquest of the world with the chief minister
<>Bahudhvaja. On his return, he came across Yudhis2t2hira's
<>As4vamedha horse at the city of Man2ipur. The heroic
<>Sucitra encountered S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna who were
<>leading the horse. After making them unconscious,
<>he entered the city with the sacrificial horse.
<NI>When they recovered their senses, S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a disguised
<>himself as a Bra1hman2a and Arjuna as a Bra1hman2a boy
<>and they went to Mayu1radhvaja's palace. The King
<>welcomed them respectfully. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, in his disguise
<>as Bra1hman2a told the King that he was coming from
<>Dharmapuri1 to meet the King's priest, Kr2s2n2a who was
<>to officiate at the marriage of his (Bra1hman2a's) son. He
<>added that unfortunately on his way through a forest
<>a lion caught hold of his son. Although he prayed to
<>Lord Narasim3ha, the boy could not be rescued. The
<>lion told him that he would release his son, if the
<>Bra1hman2a persuaded Mayu1radhvaja to offer one half of
<>his body as food to the lion.
<NI>On hearing the Bra1hman2a's story, Mayu1radhvaja agreed
<>to give half of his body to the lion. Just then his queen
<>Kumudvati1 appeared before them and said, “I am the
<>left half (Va1mabha1ga) of the King. You may take me
<>and offer me as food for the lion.” But the Bra1hman2a
<>replied that the lion wanted the right half of the King's
<>body.
<NI>When the King heard this, he readily agreed to give the
<>right half of his own body. Accordingly, they started
<>cutting his body into two halves. Just then, seeing tears
<>coming down from Mayu1radhvaja's left eye, the Bra1h-
<>man2a said:--“I find that you are in great sorrow; I do
<>not wish to accept a gift which is not given whole-
<>heartedly.” Mayu1radhvaja explained that his tears were
<>not caused by pain or sorrow. His left side was dis-
<>appointed in not being able to be of as much service as
<>the right side.
<NI>When S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a heard these words of the King, he
<>resumed his own shape and embraced him and blessed
<>him. After that Mayu1radhvaja completed his ya1ga and
<>started with Kr2s2n2a and Arjuna, taking Yudhis2t2hira's
<>sacrificial horse with them. (Jaimini; As4vamedha:
<>41-46).
<HI>MEDA. A serpent of the clan of Aira1vata. This serpent
<>was burnt to death at the Sarpasatra of Janamejaya.
<>(S4loka 11, Chapter 57, A1di Parva).
<HI>MEDHA1. One of the twentyfour daughters born to
<>Daks2apraja1pati of his wife Prasu1ti. Of these, thirteen [Page499-b+ 64]
<>daughters including Medha1 were married by Dharma-
<>deva. (Chapter 7, Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>MEDHA1TITHI I. Grandson of Sva1yambhuva Manu.
<>Sva1yambhuva Manu had two sons named Priyavrata and
<>Utta1napa1da. Of these Priyavrata married Saru1pa1 and
<>Barhis2mati1, daughters of Vis4vakarmapraja1pati. Medha1-
<>tithi was the son born to Priyavrata of Saru1pa1. Agni1-
<>dhra, and others were the brothers of Medha1tithi.
<>Medha1tithi became the King of Plaks2advi1pa after the
<>death of Priyavrata. (8th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<>Medha1tithi got seven sons named S4a1ntahaya, S4is4ira,
<>Sukhodaya, A1nanda, S4iva. Ks2emaka and Dhruva. They
<>all became Kings of Plaks2advi1pa. The countries they
<>ruled were named after them as S4a1ntahayavars2a, S4is4ira-
<>vars2a, Sukhodayavars2a, A1nandavars2a, S4ivavars2a, Ks2ema-
<>kavars2a and Dhruvavars2a. There are seven mountains
<>showing the boundaries of these states and they are
<>called Gomeda, Ca1ndra, Na1rada, Dundubhi, Somaka,
<>Sumana and Vaibhra1ja. In these beautiful countries
<>and grand mountains live a great many Devas,

<NI>Medha1tithi was a celebrated sage of Bha1rata. The
<>mahars2i referred to in S4u1kta 12, Anuva1ka 4, Man2d2ala
<>1 of R2gveda is Medha1tithi son of Kan2va. Once
<>Indra coming in the form of a goat drank the soma of
<>Medha1tithi and the latter called him ‘goat’ (Mes2a)
<>and thenceforth Indra got the name Mes2a. (Su1kta 51,

<HI>MEDHA1VI1 I.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A fierce sage. His father was a
<>sage known as Ba1ladhi. For a very long time Ba1ladhi
<>had no children and so, griefstricken, Ba1ladhi did
<>penance and Medha1vi1 was born as a result of his
<>penance. Even from boyhood the child showed wonder-
<>ful powers of grasping things and so he was named
<>Medha1vi1. (Chapter 135, Vana Parva). [Page500-a+ 65]
<NI>2) {%How Medha1vi1 cursed a nymph.%} One day in spring,
<>Man5jughos2a1 (S4ucismita1), a nymph, was playing with
<>other companions in the Caitrarathodya1na. Medha1vi1
<>was doing penance in a place nearby and Man5jughos2a1
<>fell in love with the sage and she went near him and
<>made love to him by dance and music. Medha1vi1 was
<>attracted by her and the sage accepted her advances
<>and lived with her for a long time.
<NI>One day Man5jughos2a1 sought permission to go to Deva-
<>loka. “Wait till daybreak” said the sage. When it was
<>morning the nymph renewed her request and the sage
<>said “Wait till I finish my evening prayers.” Hearing
<>this S4ucismita1 said “Oh, best of brahmins, how many
<>mornings and evenings have gone by this time! Fiftyfive
<>years nine months and three days have gone by since we
<>started living together”. The sage then counted the
<>years and found she was correct. The astounding fact
<>that his penance had such a long break made the sage
<>angry and he cursed her and made her into an evil
<>spirit. She begged for pardon and the sage said “If you
<>observe with fasting the Caitrakr2s2n2aika1das4i1 called
<>Pa1pamocini1 it will absolve you of all sins and give you
<>release from the curse”. (Chapter 48, Part 4, Padma

<>maiden called Sulaks2an2a1. She became an attendant of

<>of the Devas which surrounded him. When Meghana1da
<>saw it he broke the army circle of the devas and getting

<>preparations for the ya1ga. He invited Bhr2gu, An3giras,
<>Va1madeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and R2ci1ka all of whom
<>were well-versed in the Vedas and were worthy of being
<>priests in a Ya1ga of the kind he was conducting. He
<>then went and invited his Kulaguru (family priest and
<>preceptor) Vasis2t2ha for the Ya1ga. But Vasis2t2ha had to
<>officiate at a Ya1ga conducted by Indra and so he
<>commanded Nimi to postpone the Ya1ga by five hundred
<>years. Nimi did not act according to it and he perform-
<>ed the Ya1ga with the help of the other sages and com-
<>pleted it successfully. After five hundred years when
<>the Ya1ga of Indra came to a close, Vasis2t2ha came to see
<>Nimi. Nimi was asleep then and the servants in the
<>palace hesitated to go and inform him of the arrival of
<>the sage. Vasis2t2ha got angry and cursed him and made
<>him Videha (without body). At once the body of the
<>King fell to the ground and the soul got out of it. But
<>before the soul separated from the body Nimi cursed
<>Vasis2t2ha also and separated his soul from his body.
<>Vasis2t2ha was again born as the son of Mitra1varun2as.
<NI>The other sages present there took the lifeless body of
<>Nimi and after sacrificial ceremonies and worship of
<>gods started to churn the body. After some time a mighty
<>and perfect man of great brilliance was born out of it.
<>Because he was born by Mathana (churning) he was
<>named Mithi. Because he was born from his father
<>(Janaka) he was called Mithijanaka and because he was
<>born of Nimi, a Videha, he was called Videha also.
<>The country which was ruled by Mithi got the name
<>of Mithila1. It is the country of Si1ta1.
<HI>MITHILA1.
<NI>1) {%General information.%} A celebrated country of ancient
<>Bha1rata. This is situated on the north-eastern side of

<>by the renowned Janaka Kings. See under Mithi to
<>know how the country got the name Mithila1.
<NI>2) {%The-wealth of Mithila1.%} Mithila1 was the capital of the
<>extensive country of Videha. Successive generations of
<>Janaka ruled the country. Mithila1 was noted more for
<>its sa1ttvic virtues than for the pomp and glory of kings.
<>Everyday on the protruding breasts of an idol of
<>Ra1jasa-ra1jalaks2mi1 (embodiment of royal prosperity)
<>bhasma (ashes) and candana (sandalwood paste) would
<>be smeared. In the middle of Treta1yuga Videha was
<>ruled by a Janaka who brought fame and prosperity to
<>the successive generations. A devotee of S4iva and of a
<>sa1ttvic disposition he was a Nityabrahmaca1ri1 (observing
<>celibacy throughout life) and his wife a disciple of
<>Maitreyi1 and well-versed in Advaitaveda1nta was a
<>Nit abrahmaca1rin2i1.
<NI>Videha grew prosperous with agricultural wealth by
<>hard work put up by the peasants and divine wealth
<>by the virtuous deeds of the King and the people. Agri- [Page503-b+ 65]
<>culture was given importance, so much so that the
<>royal emblem itself was the figure of a plough. Rains
<>were there in season and in plenty because of the ya1gas
<>conducted properly by the King. (Ba1laka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).

<>the Dva1das4a1dityas (twelve Su1ryas) Mitra and Varun2a.
<>These two are always seen together. Agastya and
<>Vasis2t2ha were born as sons of Mitra1varun2a. It was due
<>to a curse by Mitra1varun2as that Urvas4i1 had to marry
<>King Puru1ravas, a man of the earth. Manu had no
<>children and he performed a ya1ga to placate Mitra1-

<HI>MOHINI1. The female form of Maha1vis2n2u. Devas and
<>Asuras quarrelled with each other over the right of
<>partaking the Amr2ta (nectar) obtained from the sea of
<>Milk. At that time Maha1vis2n2u appeared before them
<>in the guise of a beautiful maiden of maddening charm
<>and the asuras were guilefully made to turn their
<>attention on her for some time during which time the
<>nectar was carried away by the Devas. The female form
<>of Maha1vis2n2u was called Mohini1.
<NI>S4iva fell in love with Mohini1 and by the union of the

<>Skandha, Bha1gavata).
<HI>MOKS2A II.
<F>1) Ji1va1tma1 = The individual soul enshrined in the human body imparting to it life, motion and sensation as opposed to Parama1tma1.
<>Parama1tma1 = The Supreme spirit or Brahman
<>Sam3sa1ra = The circuit of life consisting of births and rebirths with sufferings and enjoyments of woes and happiness.</F> Moks2a means liberation and is generally
<>meant to convey the meaning of the deliverance of the
<>soul from recurring births. The Ji1va1tma1 enshrined in
<>the body has the delusion that it enjoys or suffers happi-
<>ness or woe. In truth it neither suffers nor enjoys anything.
<>It is detached from all. It is the Supreme Being (Para-
<>brahman). When Ji1va1tma1 deserts its woes it gets moks2a
<>i.e. Ji1va1tma1 gets merged with Parama1tma1. When once
<>Ji1va1tma1 merges with Parama1tma1, Ji1va1tma1 is devoid
<>of happiness or woes. It need not be enshrined in any
<>body. A Ji1va1tma1 getting released from one body joins
<>another new body and thus a Ji1va1tma1 in succession
<>enters thousands of bodies and each time without know-
<>ing the absolute Truth laments over its woes. In the
<>words of a R2s2i it is explained thus: “Ji1va1tma1, which is
<>bliss in itself living in births after births searches for
<>bliss elsewhere just as a person wearing a golden neck-
<>lace round his neck searches for the same elsewhere.”
<>The passage of Ji1va1tma1 from one birth to another and
<>the bodies that enshrine it each time constitutes the
<>worldly life. When once a Ji1va1tma1 thus involved
<>in Sam3sa1ra (mundane existence) gets real knowledge,
<>the knowledge that Ji1va1tma1 and Parama1tma1 are one
<>and the same, then that Ji1va1tma1 gets final emancipa-
<>tion, liberation from recurring births. It merges with
<>Brahman. This is called Moks2a.
<HI>MOKS2ADHARMAPARVA. A sub-divisional Parva of
<>S4a1nti Parva. It contains the chapters 174 to 365 of
<>S4a1nti Parva.
<HI>MR2GADHU1MA. A sacred place on the border of Kuru-
<>ks2etra. If one goes there and worships Maha1deva one
<>will get the benefit of conducting an As4vamedhayajn5a.
<>(S4loka 101, Chapter 83, Vana Parva).
<HI>MR2GAMANDA1. A daughter of Kas4yapa. (See under
<>Mr2gas).
<HI>MR2GA1N3KAKA. A sword. Once Kubera cursed a Yaks2a
<>and making him a lion posted it to guard the palace- [Page505-b+ 61]
<>gates of Maha1bali. He said he would be released from
<>the curse when any man on earth defeated it. Once a
<>brahmin warrior named S4ri1datta defeated this lion and
<>at once the lion changed into a Yaks2a and the Yaks2a
<>presented S4ri1datta with the sword named Mr2ga1n3kaka.
<>(Katha1pi1t2halambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>MR2GA1N3KAVATI1. Daughter of an ancient King called
<>S4ri1 Bimbaki. (See under S4ri1datta).
<HI>MR2GAS (DEER). All the animals originated from
<>Kas4yapapraja1pati. Kas4yapapraja1pati, son of Mari1ci,
<>married the eight daughters of Daks2a named Ta1mra1 etc.
<>From Ta1mra1 were born birds. Krodhavas4a1 gave birth
<>to ten girls named Mr2gi1, Mr2gamanda1, Hari1, Bhadra-
<>mada1, Ma1tan3gi1, S4a1rdu1li1, S4veta1, Surabhi, Surasa1 and
<>Kadru1. Mr2gas (deer) are the children of Mr2gi1. (Va1l-
<>mi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 4).
<HI>MR2GASVAPNODBHAVAPARVA. A subsidiary Parva
<>of the Vana Parva of Maha1bha1rata. Chapter 258 of
<>Vana Parva constitutes this Parva.
<HI>MR2GA1VATI1. See under Udayana.
<HI>MR2GAVYA1DHA. The disguise S4iva took when he
<>went to test the devotion of Paras4ura1ma. Paras4ura1ma
<>once went to the forests and did penance to please S4iva
<>to learn archery from him. S4iva in the form of a
<>Mr2gavya1dha (forest hunter) appeared before Paras4u-
<>ra1ma and tested his sincerity in his penance in several
<>ways. S4iva was pleased to find Paras4ura1ma's devotion
<>to S4iva unwavering and blessed him. He gave instruct-
<>ions in archery and also permitted him to go round the
<>earth. (Chapter 65, Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a).

<>children named Dambha and Ma1ya1. (4th Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).
<HI>MR2TAM. See under Pramr2tam.
<HI>MR2TASAN5JI1VANI1. This is a medicinal herb to give
<>life to those who are dead. When in the Ra1ma-Ra1van2a
<>battle Laks2man2a and others fell dead, S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>wanted Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 to be brought to revive them
<>back to life. Ja1mbava1n the oldest among the monkey-
<>warriors then instructed Hanu1ma1n to get it from the
<>mountain Maha1meru explaining to him the way to
<>reach there. He said: “If you go a hundred yojanas
<>(1200 Kilometres) from here to the north you would
<>reach Ra1mes4vara the southernmost point of Bha1rata.
<>From there if you go to the north another thousand
<>yojanas you would reach the Hima1layas which is the
<>northern-most point of Bha1rata. Himava1n is thousand
<>yojanas high, two thousand yojanas wide and is
<>long enough to reach the two oceans on the east and
<>the west.
<NI>On that mountain is the marriage-dais of Pa1rvati1 and
<>Parames4vara and you will find places where Parames4-
<>vara had sat for practising penances. On the northern
<>side under a big Ku1vala tree lies Ka1madhenu. This
<>cow gives milk to the sages and tourists who go there. [Page506-a+ 64]
<>Nine thousand yojanas to the north of this there are
<>two mountains named Hemaku1t2a and Ratnaku1t2a. The
<>centre of that is R2s2abhavars2a. On a big Ka1raskara
<>tree there will be hanging a king with his face down-
<>wards after being cursed by the sage Durva1sas. He
<>will be released from the curse by you. If one eats the
<>fruits of this tree one will be free from greying of hairs
<>and rugosity.
<NI>If you go farther north from Hemaku1t2a you will reach
<>the mountain Nis2adha. There is a lake there. If one
<>bathes there one will be granted all prosperity by
<>Laks2mi1devi1. Farther to the north is situated Maha1meru.
<>The greatness of this mountain is indescribable.
<NI>Maha1meru has got four supporting mountain pillars
<>named Mandara, Merumandara, Supa1rs4va and
<>Kumuda. The abode of the three deities is on the top
<>of this mountain. On a peak in the centre is living
<>Brahma1 with his wives Va1n2i1, Ga1yatri1 and Sa1vitri1 as
<>creator of the universe. This place is called Satyaloka
<>and to the west of it is S4ri1 Vaikun2t2ha the abode of
<>Maha1vis2n2u. Ma1devi1 and Bhu1devi1 are his two wives.
<>He is the god who protects us all. To the east of
<>Satyaloka is Kaila1sa, the abode of S4iva. He lives there
<>with his wives Gan3ga1 and Pa1rvati1 and sons Gan2es4a
<>and S4ubrahman2ya. To the south of Satyaloka is the
<>city Sam3yamani1 the abode of Yamadharmara1ja. He
<>lives there with his wife Ka1lini1 and sons Vid2ava,
<>Mahima1 and Di1paka. To the east of this is the wonder-
<>ful Devaloka. There lives Indra, his wife S4aci1devi1 and
<>son Jayanta with thirtythree crores of Devas. Celestial
<>nymphs like Urvas4i1, Rambha1 and Tilottama1 live there.
<>Ka1madhenu, the Kalpa tree, Aira1vata, Uccais4s4ravas,
<>and Cinta1man2i are all there. You will find Amara1vati1
<>the Capital of Indra and Sudharma1 his court there.
<NI>On the northern side of Meru is a tall As4vattha tree.
<>To the north of that is the Ni1la-maha1giri (the great
<>blue mountain). Kas4yapa has installed a deity named
<>S4vetavara1hamu1rti there. Beyond that is the R2s2abha1dri
<>(ox-shaped mountain). It is believed that a divine ox
<>became a mountain there. Its two horns are like two
<>peaks. This mountain contains many divine medicines
<>of which S4alyaharan2i1, Vis4alyakaran2i1, Sandha1nakaran2i1
<>and Mr2tasan5ji1vani1 are the most important.
<NI>Once the asuras defeated the Devas. Then Parames4-
<>vara and Maha1vis2n2u gave the Devas these four
<>medicinal herbs. They planted them here and watered
<>them from the Milk-sea. Around these precious plants
<>stand guard the pa1rs2adas of S4iva and the Discus
<>Sudars4ana of Vis2n2u.” (Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Kamba
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>There is another statement in the Maha1bha1rata that
<>San5ji1vani1 is an art, the use of a mantra. S4ukra1ca1rya
<>by this art brought to life all the asuras killed in a war

<>of Adharma. They got a son named Anr2ta and a
<>daughter named Nikr2ti. From them were born Bhaya, [Page506-b+ 64]

<>in Maha1bha1rata. The statements regarding Mr2tyu as
<>a deva are as follows:--
<NI>(i) Three sons were born to Nikr2ti, wife of Adharma.
<>One of them was Mr2tyu. Mr2tyudeva has neither wife
<>nor children because he is the destroyer of all. (S4loka
<>54, Chapter 66, A1di Parva).
<NI>(ii) Once the son of an old Gautami1 was bitten by a
<>snake. A hunter seeing it rushed to kill the serpent
<>but Gautami1 objected to it. She advised him that it
<>was a sin to injure any living being. The serpent then
<>said, “It is not my fault that I bit the boy. I was
<>persuaded by the god of death to do so.” The god of
<>death Mr2tyudeva also appeared there then. He con-
<>firmed the snake's statement and added that God had
<>programmed all events beforehand and the boy's
<>death was not due to any mistake on anybody's part.
<>(S4loka 50, Chapter 1, Anus4a1sana Parva)
<NI>(iii) Once Mr2tyu followed the King Sudars4ana, but
<>Mr2tyudeva had to withdraw after accepting defeat
<>because the King had been living a virtuous life of high
<>standard. (See under Sudars4ana).
<NI>The statements regarding Mr2tyu as a goddess are the
<>following:
<NI>(1) This devata1 was born from the body of Brahma1
<>in the shape of a woman. (S4loka 17, Chapter 53,
<>Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(2) Brahma1 gave the work of destruction to Mr2tyu.
<>When she got that work she wept aloud. (S4loka 21.

<>(S4loka 17, Chapter 54, Dron2a Parva).
<NI>(4) Brahma1 assured the goddess of death that any
<>destruction by her would not be deemed as a sin.
<>(S4loka 44, Chapter 54, Dron2a Parva).

<HI>MUKTA1PHALAKETU. A Vidya1dhara youth. The
<>story of this young man who was born to kill Vidyud-
<>dhvaja, a fire-brand of an asura, is told thus in Katha1-
<>saritsa1gara.
<NI>An eminent asura of name Vidyutprabha performed
<>penance to propitiate Brahma1 to get a son. As a
<>result of the blessings of Brahma1 he got a son invincible
<>to the Devas. He was named Vidyuddhvaja. Even
<>from boyhood he was very brave and daring. Once
<>when he saw some demons standing guard to protect
<>the asura family he said “At present our country is
<>being protected by the hands of others. I shall, there-
<>fore, perform penance and obtain boons to remove
<>this disgrace. I will conquer our enemies.” Vidyud- [Page508-a+ 65]
<>dhvaja went straight to the forests and performed penance
<>to propitiate Brahma1. When the austerities became
<>severe, Vidyuddhvaja observed fasting without break
<>and the whole world became excited due to anxiety.
<>So Brahma1 appeared before him in person and gave
<>him many divine weapons like Brahma1stra. For
<>Brahma1stra the only counter-missile was Pa1s4upata
<>and so Brahma1 warned him that it should be used
<>only when it was found absolutely necessary.
<NI>Vidyuddhvaja became arrogant with the possession of
<>such divine weapons and started for Indraloka with
<>his father and his army to conquer Indra. He knew
<>that Indra was ready to face him with a big army
<>headed by Candraketu and Padmas4ekhara.
<NI>The battle that ensued was very grim. Even Brahma1
<>and Rudra came to see the fight. In a combat with
<>Indra, Vidyutprabha was killed. Vidyuddhvaja saw
<>his father killed, got furious and sent Brahma1stra
<>against Indra who in turn opposed it with Pa1s4upata.
<>Vidyuddhvaja fainted. Devas sounded the trumpets of
<>victory and left the place.
<NI>After some time Vidyuddhvaja awoke from the swoon
<>and lamented thus to those of his men who were
<>around:--“My tapobala (strength resulting from
<>penance) was of no use. I have decided to die fighting
<>against Indra. I do not want to return to a country
<>where my father is not alive. On hearing this his aged
<>minister pointed out to him his mistake in having
<>used the Brahma1stra untimely.
<NI>Vidyuddhvaja decided to attain more powers and so
<>he went to the base of the Hima1layas to perform
<>penance to propitiate S4iva. Pleased at his penance of
<>five thousand years S4iva appeared in person and asked
<>him to name the boon he wanted. Vidyuddhvaja
<>demanded “I must be able to kill Indra in a battle.”
<>S4iva granted him the boon.
<NI>Vidyuddhvaja once again attacked Indra with a huge
<>army. In the fierce battle that followed Indra fell
<>down fainting by the weapons of Vidyuddhvaja. At
<>once a voice from the air commanded, “Take away
<>Indra from the battlefield. It is dangerous to keep
<>him there” Va1yu came and carried him away swiftly.
<>When Indra awoke from fainting he went to
<>Brahmaloka with all the other devas.
<NI>Vidyuddhvaja established himself in Amara1vati1, the
<>capital city of Indra and lived there enjoying his life
<>as Indra. In the meantime Candraketu, King of the
<>Vidya1dharas was sitting in Va1yuloka musing thus, “How
<>long should we remain thus displaced from our
<>positions! There is no waning of the power of Vidyud-
<>dhvaja. My friend Padmas4ekhara, King of Gandhar-
<>vas, has gone to S4ivapura to perform penance. I do
<>not know whether he has been blessed by god. Anyhow
<>I will act after hearing from him.”
<NI>As his musings came to an end Padmas4ekhara himself
<>appeared before him and said: “I have come to tell you
<>the glad news that S4iva told me. S4iva said “Son, do
<>not grieve. You will get your country back. You will
<>get a son and a daughter. They will be top-ranking
<>men in all activities. The husband of your daughter
<>will kill Vidyuddhvaja.”
<NI>A happy Candraketu went to Kaila1sa with his wife
<>Mukta1vali1 and started penance. Padmas4ekhara went
<>and mentioned to the devas all that had happened.
<>The devas then went to Maha1vis2n2u and told him of [Page508-b+ 65]
<>the boons which Vidyuddhvaja had received from S4iva
<>and how he was ruling Indraloka then. After hearing
<>them patiently Vis2n2u said that only S4iva could do
<>anything in that matter. They all then went to the
<>temple of Siddhi1s4vara and sat there meditating on
<>S4iva.
<NI>In the meantime Bhagava1n appeared before Candraketu
<>and blessed him and said he would get a very valorous
<>son who would kill Vidyuddhvaja and restore Devaloka
<>to the devas. But after that he would be born as a man
<>on earth by a curse. Padma1vati1 daughter of a
<>Gandharva King, would by the strength of her penance
<>release him from the curse and help him to get his
<>original state as a Gandharva. He would then marry
<>Padma1vati1 and remain as emperor of the Vidya1dharas
<>for ten Kalpas together. Candaraketu and wife came
<>back to Va1yuloka.
<NI>At this time S4iva appeared in person to those sitting
<>in the temple of Siddhi1s4vara and said that a son would
<>be born to Candraketu from a part of his and that
<>valorous youth would kill Vidyuddhvaja. Mukta1vali1
<>wife of Candraketu became pregnant at that time and
<>soon delivered a son. He was named Mukta1phalaketu.
<>Even from boyhood he became an ardent devotee of
<>S4iva and started performing penance to propitiate
<>S4iva. S4iva appeared before him and gave him the
<>secrets of many techniques in archery.
<NI>Vidyuddhvaja was once bathing in a river when muddy
<>waters flowed from up the river and the arrogant
<>demon sent a servant to find out the cause thereof.
<>When he went up by the shores he saw an ox and an
<>elephant bathing in the river. They were the Va1hanas
<>of S4iva and Indra. The elephant was the famous
<>Aira1vata. He came back and intimated to Vidyuddhvaja
<>what he saw. The demon then ordered his people to
<>bring the culprits to his side. But the Va1hanas killed
<>those who went to capture them and then they went
<>to their masters, S4iva and Indra. Hearing about this
<>audacity of the demon-chief the Devas challenged the
<>asuras to a fight. This time the army of the devas was
<>led by Mukta1phalaketu.
<NI>A Gandharva princess named Padma1vati1 grew up to
<>be a beautiful maiden at that time. She was in love
<>with Mukta1phalaketu. Padma1vati1 was one day plucking
<>flowers from a pond in the Gandharva land thinking
<>about Mukta1phalaketu who had gone to war against
<>the asuras. A demoness who was going to eat flesh in the
<>battle-field of the devas and asuras saw Padma1vati1, took
<>her and went up. Mukta1phalaketu coming to know of
<>this went up with her and got back Padma1vati1 who was
<>struggling in the hands of the demoness like streaks of
<>lightning among clouds. Then he asked her maids about
<>her and they said, “She is the daughter of the Gandharva
<>King Padmas4ekhara. Padma1vati1 is her name. She is
<>unmarried. But she is betrothed to the son of Candra-
<>ketu named Mukta1phalaketu, who is born to destroy
<>Vidyuddhvaja. She has come here to practise
<>penance for the success of her father and Mukta1phala-
<>ketu in this war between devas and asuras.”
<NI>Padma1vati1 recognised Mukta1phalaketu from the words
<>of his followers. But the latter had to go back to Deva-
<>loka under instructions from Indra. The Deva1sura war be-
<>came fierce. By the valour and skill of Mukta1phalaketu
<>many of the asuras were killed. The war was won.
<>Mukta1phalaketu was given a grand reception at devaloka [Page509-a+ 64]
<>and was then sent back. Mukta1phalaketu did not seem
<>to be happy and everybody thought that it might be
<>due to his having killed Vidyuddhvaja. But the real
<>cause was his separation from Padma1vati1.
<NI>A sorrow-stricken Padma1vati1 sent her female companion
<>Manoharika1 to the country of Vidya1dharas to enquire
<>about Mukta1phalaketu. What she saw there was a sad
<>Mukta1phalaketu pining to see Padma1vati1. Both now
<>understood each other and Manoharika1 returned with
<>presents for Padma1vati1 from Mukta1phalaketu.
<NI>At that time Mukta1phalaketu went to see a Mahars2i
<>named Tapodhana. Disregarding the objections of
<>the disciple Dr2d2havrata who stood guard outside the
<>a1s4rama Mukta1phalaketu entered the a1s4rama with his
<>friend. Dr2d2havrata followed them. When they entered
<>the a1s4rama they found the a1s4rama empty and at once
<>Dr2d2havrata cursed them both to be born on earth as
<>men. Padma1vati1 fainted when she heard the news.
<>When she regained her consciousness she started
<>practising austerities sitting in a temple devoted to
<>Gauri1, wife of S4iva. She meditated on her husband
<>Mukta1phalaketu in his life on earth and performed
<>penance to propitate S4iva. By the grace of S4iva
<>Mukta1phalaketu got his original life and he married
<>Padma1vati1 and led a happy married life. (Taran3ga 2,
<>Padma1vati1lambaka, Katha1saritsa1gara.)

<>the father of the universe granted him the boon.
<>(Chapter 60, Va1mana Pura1n2a).

<>went to Maha1meru and challenged the Yaks2as and

<>Indra also did not accept the challenge. Then he entered
<>Amara1vati1 with a raised hand. Nobody stopped him.
<>Going to the palace of Indra he said “Oh, thousand- [Page511-b+ 65]
<>eyed deva, fight with me or leave this place”. On hear-
<>ing it Indra left his place and came to earth. Then Mura
<>took possession of Aira1vata and Vajra. He lived in

<>vata and landed at a place on the banks of the river
<>Sarayu1 where Raghu a king of the solar dynasty was
<>conducting a ya1ga. Mura1sura went to Raghu and said
<>“Come on, fight with me or you should stop this ya1ga.
<>You should not worship the devas.” Then the great and
<>brilliant Maitra1varun2i sage, Vasis2t2ha told him, “Daitya,
<>what use is there in conquering men of the earth? You
<>should win against those who are never defeated. If you
<>want to fight go and challenge Antaka, the god of Death.
<>Oh, King of asuras, that boy of an Antaka would never
<>obey your orders. If you conquer him you will have de-
<>feated all the world.”
<NI>On hearing the words of Vasis2t2ha, Mura started to fight
<>Dharmara1ja. Yama on hearing that Mura was coming
<>to fight him went to Maha1vis2n2u on his buffalo as he knew
<>he could kill him. Maha1vis2n2u asked him to send Mura
<>to him. Yama returned to his place to see Mura there
<>ready to fight. Yama told him that he would do what-
<>ever Mura ordered him and then Mura said “You should
<>stop killing people or I will chop your head off.”
<>Dharmara1ja replied “Mura, if you had been the person
<>who had appointed me for this job I would have will-
<>ingly followed your instructions. But I am under the
<>control of somebody else.” Mura asked “Who is the
<>person superior to you? Tell me, I shall surely defeat
<>him.” Yama said “There is an individual called Vis2n2u
<>holding a Cakra and a Gada1 in his hands living in S4veta-
<>dvi1pa. He is the person who has appointed me.” Mura
<>anxiously asked “Where is his abode? I shall go there
<>myself to conquer him.” Antaka replied “You go
<>to the ocean of Milk. It is there that Vis2n2u, the omni-
<>present protector of the universe is residing.” Mura said
<>“Well, I am going to him. But you should in the mean-
<>time discontinue your work of killing people.” Yama
<>replied “Go and win him. If you defeat him I shall
<>abide by your instructions.”
<NI>Mura went to fight Maha1vis2n2u. It was at this time that
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a the incarnation of Maha1vis2n2u attacked the
<>capital city of Naraka1sura, Pra1gjyotis2a. Mura went to
<>the help of Naraka1sura. The boundary of the city was
<>well-fenced with ropes but Kr2s2n2a cut them all and re-
<>moved the barrier. In the fight that ensued both
<>Naraka1sura and Mura were killed by the celebrated
<>weapon Sudars4ana of Kr2s2n2a. From then Kr2s2n2a
<>got the name of Muramathana. (10th Skandha,
<>Bha1gavata).

<>of Brahma1. The capital of this valorous Mura1sura was

<>Vis2n2u and in the fierce fight that took place Vis2n2u was
<>defeated and he ran away from the battlefield and
<>started sleeping in a cave named Sim3havati1 in the neigh-
<>bourhood of Badarika1s4rama. Mura went there too. Then
<>Maha1vis2n2u created a Devi1 through his Yogama1ya1 and
<>made her kill Mura. [Page512-a+ 65]
<>Pleased at the slaughter of Mura, Vis2n2u blessed her and
<>said “From today onwards you will be known as ‘Eka1-

<>ra1ghava’. This drama has eight acts. Mura1ri has men-
<>tioned in his works about Anan3gahars2a who lived in
<>700 A.D. and Ratna1kara who lived in 750 A.D. It is
<>therefore, surmised that Mura1ri must have lived during

<>Bhavabhu1ti and his verses indicate he had the style of

<>Once a poor man of no resources went to the house of
<>a great merchant named Vis4a1khila. He was then ad-
<>monishing a young man of his own caste. The merchant
<>was saying, “See, here is a dead rat on the ground. A
<>clever man would earn money by using this as a capital.
<>To you I have given money for business on several
<>occasions. Not only that you have not increased it but
<>also you have lost it.”
<NI>The poor man who went to him requested the merchant
<>to give him the dead rat. Vis4a1khila greatly amused at
<>the request gave him the rat. A rich man bought it for
<>his cat to eat and gave him instead two measures of
<>Bengal gram. He roasted it and made it palatable and
<>then with a pot of water went outside the city gates and
<>sat under a tree on the road-side. Wood-cutters were
<>passing that way carrying loads and he sold the
<>roasted gram and water to them who purchased it with
<>eagerness to ease their weariness. They gave him in
<>exchange firewood and in the evening he took it to
<>the market and sold it. With the money he purchased
<>more Bengal gram and continued the trade as before and
<>after a few days he purchased from them a great stock [Page512-b+ 64]
<>of firewood. Suddenly there were heavy rains and there
<>was a scarcity of firewood in the market and he sold
<>his stock for good price. With the money thus received
<>he purchased some goods and started a grocery shop.
<>Gradually his business increased and he became a big
<>merchant. Because he started the business from a Mu1s2ika

<>boon that father will be pleased with me and not angry
<>with me.” The second was, “Advise me how to attain
<>heaven.” The third was, “Tell me the solution of the
<>mystery, whether the soul remains after death.” Yama
<>granted the first two boons and said to him, “Boy, this
<>is a difficult question. So ask for another boon such as
<>long life, power over the world, all the pleasures of the
<>world and so on.”
<NI>The boy replied: “The things you have promised to
<>give me are useless things because after a while the
<>organs of sense will become fragile. The life also will

<>circles entwined with one another. Ten na1d2i1s are promi-
<>nent amongst them, i.e. Id2a1, Pin3gala1, Sus2umna1,
<>Ga1ndha1ri1, Hastijihva1, Pr2tha1, Yas4a1, Alambus2a1, Kuha1
<>and S4an3khini1. Any defect or harm caused to any one
<>of these ten na1d2i1s may lead even to death.
<NI>There are ten Va1yus (winds) in the body. The five Pra1n2as
<>called Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Sama1na. Uda1na and Vya1na, and
<>the five Va1yus called Na1ga, Ku1rma, Kr2kala, Devadatta
<>and Dhanan5jaya together constitute the ten Va1yus.
<>Pra1n2a is the most important Va1yu. This va1yu does the
<>emptying as well as the refilling of the other nine va1yus
<>and thus sustains life. The pra1n2ava1yu has its existence
<>ever in the chest of living beings and fills the body
<>with air through breathing in, out, coughing etc. It
<>depends on life and it is called Pra1n2ava1yu as it moves
<>or travels with life.
<NI>Apa1na leads va1yu downwards. It is Apa1na which directs
<>man's food downwards. Also it keeps in its fold urine
<>and semen. This va1yu is called Apa1na as its function is
<>adhonayana (leading downwards) as mentioned above.
<>Sama1nava1yu conveys to the different parts in the body
<>in equal manner the things which living beings eat,
<>drink and smell as also blood, bile, phlegm and va1ta.
<>Uda1na causes the shivering of lips, flushing of face and
<>eyes and excitement of joints etc. Vya1na causes the
<>limbs to be closed and stretched, and it excites diseases.
<>Na1ga exists in nausea, Ku1rma in the bulging of the eyes [Page513-b+ 65]
<>Kr2kala in food, Devadatta in yawning and Dhanan5jaya
<>in sound. Dhanan5jaya does not quit the body even after
<>death.
<NI>Life, Pra1n2a, travels through the na1d2i1cakra depending on
<>ten different courses, i.e. San3kra1nti, Vis2uva, Ahar,
<>Ra1tri, the two ayanas (Daks2in2a and Uttara), Adhiva1sa
<>R2n2a, U1nara1tra and Dhana. U1nara1tra means hiccough,
<>R2n2a cough, Dhana breathing and Adhiva1sa yawning.
<>Of the two ayanas, Uttara and Daks2in2a, the former is
<>the course towards the left and the latter towards the
<>right and Vis2uva is the centre between the two.
<>San3kra1nti is the change of position of Vis2uva. On he
<>left side of the human body is the na1d2i1 called Id2a1, on
<>the right side Pin3gala1 and between the two Sus2umna1.
<>The pra1n2a above these three na1d2i1s is Ahar i.e. day and
<>that below is Apa1na, i.e. night. Thus every va1yu assumes
<>ten different forms.
<NI>There are various kinds of pra1n2a1ya1ma (control of
<>breaths). Pra1n2a1ya1ma practised with the pra1n2a contained
<>in the centre of the body is called Candragrahan2a;
<>that which supersedes physical principles is called
<>Su1ryagrahan2a. To fill the stomach with as much of va1yu
<>as is desired is Pu1rakapra1n2a1ya1ma. To remain like a full
<>pot, all breathing stopped, (Pot completely filled)
<>having closed all the openings--‘doors’--of the body is
<>Kumbhaka. The yogi1 practising Kumbhaka should
<>direct the va1yu upwards in one breath, and that practice
<>is called Recaka. He who does it should be conversant
<>with the yoga of inhalation. Erudite people call it
<>Japa, because when it is practised S4iva resident in one's
<>own body awakes within. S4iva, the King of yogins,
<>chants the mantra (japa) 21,6000 times within the course
<>of one day and one night. The soul chants the mantra--
<>Ga1yatri1--of which Brahma1, Vis2n2u and S4iva are the pre-
<>siding deities, and that is called Ajapa. He who chants
<>Ajapa will have no future births. Pra1n2a1ya1ma should be
<>followed by Kun2d2alini1yoga, Kun2d2alini1 meaning primor-
<>dial force. The force is a compound of Sun, fire and
<>Moon and its seat is the heart, where it exists in the form
<>of a sprout. Since creation is dependent upon this force
<>power for creation should be invoked on it. The yogin
<>should picture in his mind that nectar flows out of
<>Kun2d2alini1. He should also realise that the soul within
<>the body possesses form while pure soul is formless. He
<>should address this soul as ‘Ham3sa Ham3sa’. Ham3sa
<>means S4iva. S4iva exists and functions inside and outside
<>the body just as oil is in the gingelly seed and fragrance
<>in flower. Soul possessing form is of five kinds. Accord-
<>ingly Brahma1's seat is the heart, Vis2n2u's the neck,
<>Rudra's, the centre of the throat; Mahes4vara's the
<>forehead; and S4iva's, the tip of the pra1n2a. Soul without
<>form is just contrary to the above. Its place is where
<>the pra1n2a ends. By pra1n2a1ya1ma the formless soul may
<>be experienced. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 214).
<HI>NADI1JA. An ancient King. In Maha1bha1rata, Udyoga

<>that in this place, a Na1ga named Padmana1bha lived.
<HI>NAGARA. In ancient days there were rules and prin-
<>ciples regulating the construction of a city. The name
<>‘city’ could be applied to them only if they conformed
<>to the rules and principles in vogue. The principles
<>and rules of the erection of a proper city are given
<>below:--
<NI>One yojana or a half of land should be selected as
<>site.
<F>1) A yojana is approximately twelve Kilometres.</F> The planning of the city should be commenced
<>after worshipping the deity of Va1stu. There should be
<>four main gates on the four sides, East, West, North
<>and South. The South gate should be in the position of
<>Gandharvapada, West gate in the place of Varun2a, the
<>North gate in the place of Soma (Moon) and the East
<>fort gate in the place of Su1ryapada (the position of the
<>Sun). The hat2t2as (minor gates) should be wide enough
<>for elephants etc. to pass through. The main gates
<>should be six rods wide.
<NI>When the city is completed goldsmiths should be
<>settled in the Agni corner
<F>2) To know the corners see under As2t2adikpa1lakas.</F> (i. e. South East). The
<>courtesans who live by dancing etc. should have their
<>houses on the south side of the city. The houses of [Page514-b+ 64]
<>actors, those who extract oil, fishermen etc. should be
<>in the corner of Nirr2ti (South West). Sheds for chariots,
<>weapons, swords etc. should be on the western side.
<>Dealers in liquor, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons etc.
<>and servants should be given houses in the Va1yu
<>corner i.e. North West. The houses of Brahmins, hermits,
<>sages, saints, and such others should be on the north
<>side. In the I1s4a1na corner (North East) merchants of
<>vegetables and on the eastern side, the authorities of
<>the army should have their houses.
<NI>The army (Infantry, cavalry, chariots and elephants)
<>should be put up in the Agni corner. On the south the
<>goddesses who are protectors of women-folk should be
<>consecrated. Archers should live in the Nirr2ti corner.
<>Most honourable people, Treasury officers, Leaders of
<>the people, Brahmin groups and such others should
<>have their abodes on the western side. So also Ks2atri-
<>yas should have their houses on the eastern side,
<>Vais4yas on the south and S4u1dras on the west of the
<>city. Vais4yas and horses should be placed on all four
<>sides. The army also should be placed thus. The
<>movable wealth should be placed on the east side
<>and the funeral place on the south. The cattle
<>etc. should be kept on the west, farmers on the
<>north, and the outcastes on the corners. This
<>should be the plan of a city as well as that of
<>villages too.
<NI>On the east fort-gate of cities and villages Vais4ravan2a
<>and S4ri1 Bhagavati1 should be consecrated. They will
<>confer prosperity upon those who visit them. Temples
<>dedicated to Gods should be erected on the western
<>side facing the east. If temples are erected on the east
<>they should face the west and those erected on the
<>south should face the North. For the protection of the
<>city, there should be temples dedicated to Indra, Vis2n2u
<>and such other Gods. If there is no worshipping place
<>in a city, a village, a fort, or a house, such places will
<>be haunted by devils and troubled by diseases etc. If
<>cities are built according to this plan they will afford
<>both salvation and prosperity.
<NI>On the east there should be the house of Laks2mi1, in
<>the Agni corner, the kitchen on the south, bedrooms
<>in the Nirr2ti corner the weapon-house, on the west
<>the dining hall, in the Va1yu corner, the granary, on
<>the north, the treasury, and the place of worship in
<>the I1s4a1na corner.
<NI>Houses could be erected with four blocks, three blocks
<>or only one block. Houses with four blocks could be
<>made in two hundred and fiftyfive ways by making
<>changes in each block and the open verandas. Houses
<>with three blocks are of four types; with two blocks
<>are of five types; and houses of only one block are of
<>four types. There are houses and cities with twenty-
<>eight open verandas. There are fiftyfive types of
<>houses with four open verandas and seven open
<>verandas. Houses with six open verandas and eight
<>open verandas are of twenty types. In cities houses
<>should have eight open verandas (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 105).
<HI>NA1GA1RJUNA. Minister of King Cira1yus. (For details
<>see under Cira1yus).
<HI>NA1GA1RI. One of the prominent children of Garud2a.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 101, Verse 9)
<HI>NA1GAS4ATA. The mountain where Pa1n2d2u did tapas [Page515-a+ 64]
<>along with Kunti1, Ma1dri1 and others. (A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 118, Verse 47).
<HI>NA1GAS4RI1. Wife of King Dharmadatta of Kosala.
<>Ta1ra1datta1 was their daughter. (See under Dharma-
<>datta).
<HI>NA1GA1STRA. A destructive weapon (arrow). The
<>following story about the astra is told in the Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a of Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a.
<NI>In olden times there was a very powerful and mean
<>asura called Na1ga. Brahma1 resorted to virulent black
<>magic to kill Na1ga, and from the fire-pit arose a terri-
<>ble goblin called Na1gapa1s4a. It was deputed to kill
<>Na1ga and the Trimu1rtis followed it. Na1gapa1s4a went
<>to the city of Na1ga1sura called Vi1ramahendra, ascended
<>its tower and made a terrible noise the echo of which
<>caused abortion in all the pregnant na1ga women. Many
<>children fainted and many died. Na1ga1sura deputed his
<>army chieftain Vi1rasena with an army to kill the na1ga
<>goblin. At the sight of the army the goblin raised
<>another terrible cry, which blew off Vi1rasena and his
<>army, reducing them to powder. Then Na1ga1sura's
<>minister with a big army attacked the goblin. But the
<>minister was devoured by him, and the army annihilated.
<>Enraged at this defeat of his minister, Na1ga1sura attack-
<>ed the goblin with an army of crores of soldiers. But,
<>within seconds the goblin devoured the mighty army.
<>At last Na1gapa1s4a and Na1ga1sura engaged themselves in
<>a duel which lasted for years. Ultimately the goblin
<>swallowed up Na1ga1sura also. Then he went to the
<>Trimu1rtis and saluted them. They granted him many
<>boons, and S4iva, in excess of joy, wore it as one of the
<>ornaments round his neck. Some time later Na1gapa1s4a
<>set out on a tour to see the fourteen worlds, and S4iva
<>specially instructed him not to visit the S4a1lmali island.
<>He visited the various worlds earning all knowledge
<>and started for mount Kaila1sa. On his way he saw
<>S4a1lmali island, the abode of na1gas, and in violation of
<>S4iva's instructions, he entered the island. The na1gas
<>there did not honour him and his false pride made him
<>tremble with rage. Then the na1gas of the island told
<>him thus: “We have a powerful enemy, who visits us
<>every month, and unless we feed him sumptuously he
<>will devour all of us for food He is to come today, and
<>if you are capable enough, you defeat and drive him
<>off and save us. If you do so, we shall crown you as our
<>King and honour you.”
<NI>The powerful enemy of the na1gas was Garud2a and he
<>came. All the na1gas ran off at his sight. Garud2a then
<>attacked the goblin Na1gapa1s4a, who was standing un-
<>perturbed before him. There being no chance of vic-
<>tory for the goblin he ran away and took refuge with
<>S4iva. Garud2a also followed him, and demanded of
<>S4iva to return to him, his enemy, the goblin. S4iva
<>told Garud2a thus:--“If, in future he (the goblin)
<>interferes with anybody connected with you, you may
<>either punish or eat him. Do not do anything with him
<>now”.
<NI>Garud2a agreed to the above proposal of S4iva. From
<>that day onwards Na1gapa1s4a lived in Vaikun2t2ha en-
<>twined with nooses. He became the arrow called na1ga-
<>pa1s4a or na1ga1stra.
<HI>NA1GATI1RTHA I. A holy place situated on the boun-
<>dary of Kuruks2etra. Those who drink the water of

<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 37, Stanza 21 that
<>this King was born from a portion of an asura called

<>dha1ra was killed by Karn2a and his sons were defeated
<>by S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter
<>254 and Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43).
<HI>NAGNAJIT II. An asura. This asura who had been

<>Stanza 11).
<HI>NA1GODBHEDA. A holy place near Vinas4ana ti1rtha.
<>Sarasvati1 is supposed to dwell here in invisible form.
<>He who bathes here will attain na1galoka. (Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 82, Verse 112).
<HI>NAHUS2A I. A famous King of the Lunar dynasty.
<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u in the following
<>order:--Brahma1-Atri-Candra-Budha-Puru1ravas-A1yus-
<>Nahus2a.
<NI>2) {%Birth.%} A1yus, the son of Puru1ravas, married the
<>princess named Indumati1 (Svarbha1nukuma1ri1). Nahus2a
<>was the son born to the couple, thanks to the blessing of
<>the great hermit Datta1treya. Nahus2a married As4oka-
<>sundari1, the daughter of S4iva.
<NI>There is a story about the birth and marriage of Nahus2a
<>and As4okasundari1 in Padma Pura1n2a as given below:
<NI>Once S4iva and Pa1rvati1 were engaged in love-making in
<>Kaila1sa. Pa1rvati1 requested S4iva to show her the best
<>garden ever created by Brahma1. S4iva took her to
<>Nandanavana, where she saw the Kalpa tree, which
<>was beautiful all over, and she asked S4iva about its
<>special features. S4iva replied that anything asked of it
<>would be granted by the Kalpa tree. Pa1rvati1 made a
<>request to the Kalpa tree for a girl just for a test.
<>Instantly a very beautiful girl was born from the tree.
<>Pa1rvati1 named her As4okasundari1 and brought her up as
<>her daughter. Once Pa1rvati1 gave her a boon that she
<>would become the wife of King Nahus2a of the Lunar
<>family, who would be equal to Indra.
<NI>One day, when the beautiful As4okasundari1 was walking
<>with celestial maids in the Nandanavana an asura
<>named Hun2d2a the son of Vipracitti, came there. The
<>moment his eyes fell on As4okasundari1 he fell in love
<>with her. The asura spoke to her of his love and re-
<>quested her to be his wife. Not only did she refuse his
<>request but also told him that according to the boon
<>given by Pa1rvati1 she would become the wife of Nahus2a,
<>the King of the Lunar dynasty.
<NI>Hearing this Hun2d2a smiled and said: “That righteous
<>man named Nahus2a is yet to be born in the Lunar
<>dynasty. You will be much older than he. He will not suit
<>you as he will be too young. So don't waste your blooming
<>youth. Come and enjoy life with me.” But As4okasundari1
<>did not concede. Hun2d2a was disappointed. So he began
<>to think about ways to get her. He disappeared from
<>there and reappeared in the guise of a beautiful woman [Page516-a+ 65]
<>and told As4okasundari1 thus:--“Lady, I have taken a
<>fast. Hun2d2a has killed my husband. I am doing penance
<>to curse him. You may come to my hermitage on the
<>banks of the Gan3ga1”.
<NI>As4okasundari1 believed these false words. She went with
<>her. Both of them walked on and at last entered a
<>palace. Then only did she understand that it was the
<>palace of Hun2d2a, who assumed his original form and
<>tried to violate her chastity. As4okasundari1 became angry
<>and cursed Hun2d2a that he would die at the hands of
<>Nahus2a, and ran away to Kaila1sa.
<NI>Hun2d2a was sad for two reasons. On the one hand
<>he did not get As4okasundari1 and on the other hand
<>he had incurred the curse that Nahus2a would be his
<>slayer. Now what was the way to get out of the trouble?
<>He asked his minister Kampana to take Indumati1 the
<>wife of A1yus by stealth and bring her to his palace. They
<>decided to destroy Nahus2a in the womb of Indumati1, in
<>case it was not possible to carry her away. They waited
<>for an opportunity.
<NI>A1yus was an emperor of righteousness. After the marri-
<>age, for a long time he was childless. Once he visited
<>the hermit Datta1treya, in his hermitage. Datta1treya
<>who was the son of Atri and the most famous and
<>the noblest of all the hermits, was quite senseless and
<>red-eyed because of drinking, and without even the
<>Brahmasu1tra, was playing with a young woman,
<>seating her in his lap. His body was besmeared with
<>sandalwood and aloe and adorned with garlands and
<>necklaces of pearl and he was surrounded by many
<>women. The King seeing the divine hermit bowed
<>him with reverence and fear. The moment the hermit
<>saw the King, he sat in deep meditation. This continued
<>for a hundred years, at the end of which period, seeing
<>the devotion of the King, he said, “Oh King! why do
<>you take this trouble. I have left off the customs and
<>manners of Brahmins. I have no Bra1hman2ya (Brahmin-
<>ism). I am immersed in liquor, meat and women. So
<>you had better go and serve another Brahmin.”
<NI>A1yus refuted all that the hermit said and requested him
<>to bless him that he might get a son. Finally the hermit
<>ordered the King to bring meat and liquor in a skull.
<>The King obeyed him. Datta1treya was pleased at the
<>devotion and willingness to serve as a disciple and told
<>the King that a son would be born to him; that the
<>son would be a worshipper of Devati1rthas (Holy baths),
<>that he would not be defeated by devas, asuras, Kinnaras
<>giants, and Ks2atriyas, that he would be the protector of
<>his subjects and that he would be a great scholar in
<>Vedas and S4a1stras. Saying this he gave the King a
<>fruit to be given to his wife. The King returned to his
<>palace.
<NI>The King gave the fruit to his wife Indumati1. She ate
<>it and became pregnant. One night she gave birth to a
<>son. When the servant-maid went out of the room of
<>confinement Hun2d2a entered into her body and went
<>in. When all were asleep he took the child and ran to
<>his palace at Ka1n5canapura. He gave the child to his
<>wife Vipula1 and asked her to make a sauce of the child
<>for him. Vipula1 gave the child to the servant woman to
<>cook it. With the aid of the cook she hid the child and
<>prepared a sauce with some other flesh. The cook took
<>the child to the hermitage of Vasis2t2ha and placed it at
<>the door of the hermitage, in the night. At dawn
<>Vasis2t2ha came out of the hermitage and seeing the [Page516-b+ 64]
<>child took it, named it Nahus2a and brought him up.
<>The King and his wife Indumati1 cried for a long time
<>over the loss of the child. At that time Na1rada came
<>there and told them that their son would return
<>soon.
<NI>Once Nahus2a was bringing Samits (butea-fuel) when
<>he heard some devaca1ran2as (heavenly singers) saying
<>among themselves the history of Nahus2a. Nahus2a heard
<>it. He told Vasis2t2ha all that he had heard. Vasis2t2ha
<>told him all the stories from the beginning to his being
<>kidnapped by Hun2d2a. Nahus2a was amazed at what
<>he heard. He wanted to kill Hun2d2a instantly. So he
<>bowed before Vasis2t2ha and taking bow and arrow went
<>away to kill Hun2d2a.
<NI>Believing that he had eaten Nahus2a, Hun2d2a approached
<>As4okasundari1 again and told her that he had actually
<>eaten Nahus2a. As4okasundari1 felt very sad when she
<>heard this. At that time a Kinnara named Vidyuddhara
<>and his wife came there. They consoled As4okasundari1
<>and told her that Nahus2a was alive. He continued.
<NI>“Oh beautiful lady, that great sage will kill Hun2d2a1-
<>sura and marry you, and live with you as an emperor
<>in this world, as S4akra (Indra) in heaven. From Nahus2a
<>will be born to you a son named Yaya1ti, who will be
<>righteous, kind and loving towards his subjects and
<>equal to Indra, and a hundred daughters who would
<>be exceedingly beautiful and of very fine character. Then
<>Nahus2a will go to heaven and become Devendra.
<>At that time your son Yaya1ti will be the emperor and
<>will rule his subjects with kindness. Four sons, who
<>would possess prowess and valour, who would be second
<>to none in archery will be born to him. They will be
<>known by the names Turvasu, Puru, Kuru and Yadu.
<>Powerful and mighty sons called Bhoja, Bhi1ma,
<>Andhaka, Kukkura, Vr2s2n2i, S4rutasena, Srutadha1ra and
<>Ka1ladam3s2t2ra will be born to Yadu. They will become
<>famous by the name Ya1davas. Several sons will be born
<>to them. Thus the family of Nahus2a and yourself will
<>increase.”
<NI>By this time Nahus2a had arrived at the spot fully armed

<NI>{%Became a python by the curse of Agastya.%} To get remission
<>from the sin of Brahmahatya1, incurred by killing Vr2tra1-
<>sura, Indra hid himself in a cluster lotuses in the Ma1nasa
<>lake. The devas who were worried due to the absence
<>of Indra, elected Nahus2a as Indra temporarily. Nahus2a
<>wanted to get Indra1n2i1. Agastya cursed Nahus2a and

<HI>NAKULA.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} The fourth of the Pa1n2d2avas. Ma1dri1, the
<>second of the two wives of Pa1n2d2u meditated on the twin
<>gods As4vini1devas, and recited one of the Mantras given
<>to Kunti1 by the hermit Durva1sas and the two sons
<>Nakula and Sahadeva were born to her from those
<>gods. It is mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 67, Stanza 111 that Nakula and Sahadeva
<>were immensely handsome.
<NI>2) {%Story of Nakula till the Bha1rata battle.%} Naming and
<>such other rituals after birth were performed for Nakula
<>also as in the case of the other Pa1n2d2ava children, by the
<>hermits who lived in S4atas4r2n3ga. The ceremony of in-
<>vestiture with the Brahma1 string was conducted by
<>Kas4yapa the priest of Vasudeva. The royal hermit S4uka
<>taught Nakula archery and swordsplay, in his
<>boyhood. When Pa1n2d2u died, Ma1dri1 jumped into the [Page518-b+ 64]
<>funeral pyre and died leaving her two sons with Kunti1.
<>After this the hermits of S4atas4r2n3ga took Kunti1 and her
<>five sons to Bhi1s2ma at Hastina1pura.
<NI>At Hastina1pura, Nakula learned archery under the great
<>teacher Dron2a. According to the instruction of the
<>teacher, Arjuna had to fight with him (teacher) on the
<>completion of the teaching and during that fight Nakula
<>and Sahadeva were the guards of Arjuna's chariot-
<>wheels. As Nakula was such an expert in wielding the
<>weapons, he got the name ‘Atirathi’. (M.B. A1di Parva,
<>Chapter 138, Stanza 30). When the lac-palace was
<>completed at Va1ran2a1vata, the Pa1n2d2avas shifted to that
<>mansion by the instruction of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. When the
<>lac-palace was set fire to, the Pa1n2d2avas escaped by way
<>of an underground passage and reached the banks of
<>the Gan3ga1. There Nakula and Sahadeva fell down
<>weary and exhausted. Bhi1ma carried them on his
<>shoulders. After Baka had been killed, they proceeded
<>to Pa1n5ca1lapura, where at the Svayam3vara (marriage)
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 became the wife of the Pa1n2d2avas. They returned
<>to Hastina1pura. A son named S4ata1ni1ka was born to
<>Nakula by Pa1n5ca1li1. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 95,
<>Stanza 75).
<NI>After that Nakula married Karen2umati1, the daughter
<>of the King of Cedi. A son named Niramitra was born
<>to the couple. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 95, Stanza
<>70).
<NI>Nakula was then sent to the kingdoms of the west for
<>regional conquest, by Dharmaputra. The wealth of the
<>kingdoms he had conquered, was carried on ten
<>thousand camels to the capital Hastina1pura. (M.B.
<>Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 32). After the Ra1jasu1ya
<>(imperial consecration) of Yudhis2t2hira, Nakula went
<>to Ga1ndha1ra to escort Subala and his sons. After the
<>defeat of Yudhis2t2hira in the game of dice, the Pa1n2d2a-
<>vas went to live in the forest. At that time Nakula put
<>soil all over his body and sat on the ground because of
<>his profound grief. In the forest, once Jat2a1sura carried
<>away Nakula. (See under Jat2a1sura). Nakula killed
<>Ks2eman3kara, Maha1maha and Suratha in the forest
<>At Dvaitavana (a forest) Nakula went to a lake to
<>fetch water and was killed by Dharmadeva who appear-
<>ed in the form of a crane. At the request of Dharma-
<>putra, who came afterwards, all the Pa1n2d2avas includ-
<>ing Nakula were brought to life again, by Dharma.
<NI>During the pseudonymity of the Pa1n2d2avas at the city of
<>Vira1t2a, Nakula assumed the name Granthika. When
<>the period of pseudonymity expired, Nakula fought
<>with the Trigartas on behalf of the King Vira1t2a. On
<>the return of the Pa1n2d2avas after the expiry of their
<>forest-life and pseudonymity, when Duryodhana
<>announced that he would give not even a single dot of
<>land to them, Nakula was very eager to decide the
<>matter by a battle. He proposed that the King Dru-
<>pada should be made the chief captain of the army.
<NI>3) {%Nakula in the Bha1rata-battle.%} The following is the
<>part played by Nakula in the battle of Kuruks2etra.

<NI>(xii) He fought with Vr2s2asena. (M.B. Karn2a Parva,
<>Chapter 61, Stanza 36).
<NI>(xiii) Nakula killed Citrasena, Satyasena and
<>Sus2en2a the sons of Karn2a. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter
<>10).
<NI>4) {%After the Bha1rata-battle.%}
<NI>(i) After the battle, Nakula explained to Yudhis2t2hira,
<>the duties of a house holder. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 12).
<NI>(ii) On the instruction of Yudhis2t2hira, Nakula became
<>the chief captain of the army. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 41, Stanza 12).
<NI>(iii) After the battle, the palace of Durmars2an2a the
<>son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was given to Nakula by Dharma-
<>putra. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 44, Stanza 10).
<NI>(iv) After the battle when Yudhis2t2hira performed the
<>horse sacrifice, Nakula and Bhi1masena stood as pro-
<>tectors of the city. (M.B. As4vamedha Parva, Chapter
<>72, Stanza 19).
<NI>(v) Nakula went to the forest to see Kunti1, who was
<>engaged in penance during her latter days. (M.B.
<>A1s4ramava1si a Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 8).
<NI>5) {%The end.%} At the ‘great departure’ (Maha1prastha1na)
<>of the Pa1n2d2avas, Nakula died in the forest. It is
<>mentioned in Maha1bha1rata, Svarga1rohan2a Parva,
<>Chapter 4, Stanza 9, that after death Nakula and
<>Sahadeva attained the position of the As4vini1devas.
<NI>6) {%The name Nakula.%} It is stated in Maha1bha1rata,
<>Vira1t2a Parva, Chapter 5, Stanza 25 that the name
<>‘Nakula’ was given to him because there were none
<>more handsome than he in the family (Kula) of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas.
<HI>NA1KULA. An ancient country in India. (M.B.
<>Bhi1s2ma Parva, Chapter 50, Stanza 53).
<HI>NALA I. Nala the King of Nis2adha. (As the history of
<>Nala is included under the word Damayanti1, some
<>points which are not given there, are mentioned here).
<NI>(i) Nala was the son of Vi1rasena, the King of Nis2adha.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 52, Stanza 56).
<NI>(ii) Once the hermit Br2hadas4va came to the Palace of
<>Vi1rasena and praised Nala a good deal and spoke
<>highly of his good qualities to his father. (M.B. Vana
<>Parva, Chapter 53, Stanza 2).
<NI>(iii) When Nala was playing in the garden some swans
<>with golden wings flew to the lake in the garden. Nala
<>caught hold of one of them just for fun. The swan said
<>to Nala, “If you will let me off, I will tell Damayanti1
<>about you.” So it was released. As a reward it flew to [Page519-b+ 65]
<>the country of Vidarbha and persuaded Damayanti1 to
<>love Nala. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 53).
<NI>(iv) After death Nala sat in the aerial chariot of Indra
<>and witnessed the battle fought by Arjuna with the
<>Kauravas at the end of the forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>(M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 56, Stanza 10).
<NI>(v) Previous birth. Two different stories are narrated
<>about the previous birth of Nala.
<NI>1) In the previous birth Nala was a Vais4ya of the
<>city of Pippala in the Gaud2a country. This Vais4ya
<>became abstinent and after leaving off everything he
<>had, he went to the forest. There, according to the
<>advice of a hermit he undertook the fast of Gan2es4a.
<>As a result he was born as Nala in the next birth.
<>(Gan2es4a Pura1n2a).
<NI>2) Nala and Damayanti1 were foresters named A1huka
<>and A1huka1. S4iva was pleased with the couple. So they
<>were born in royal families in the next birth, and S4iva
<>in the form of a swan, helped them. (S4iva Pura1n2a,
<>S4atarudra Sam3hita1).
<HI>NALA II. An ancient hermit. In Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>7, Stanza 17, it is mentioned that this hermit lives in
<>the palace of Indra.
<HI>NALA III. A monkey. This monkey was the son of
<>Vis4vakarma1. S4ri1 Ra1ma and the monkey-army went to
<>redeem Si1ta1 from Lan3ka1 and reached the sea-shore. A
<>bridge had to be made to cross the sea and reach
<>Lan3ka1. Immediately Varun2a the King of the seas
<>appeared there and said, “Nala who is in the monkey-
<>army, is the son of Vis4vakarma1. His father had given
<>him a blessing that he would become as expert an
<>architect as his father. So let the construction of the
<>bridge be commenced under his supervision.” Accord-
<>ingly under the supervision of Nala, Ra1ma's bridge of
<>rock was completed and S4ri1 Ra1ma and the army of
<>monkeys reached Lan3ka1 by walking over this bridge
<>(Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 22).
<NI>In the battle hetween Ra1ma and Ra1van2a, Nala fought
<>with the giant Tun2d2aka. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter
<>285, Stanza 9).
<HI>NALAKU1BARA. A son of Vais4ravan2a. He had a
<>brother called Man2igri1va.
<NI>1) {%Cursing Ra1van2a,%} It was the time when Ra1van2a was
<>ruling over Lan3ka1 and terrorising the fourteen worlds.
<>As he was carrying on his conquests, once he came to
<>a round rock near Kaila1sa. It was night. Rambha1 had
<>fixed a rendezvous near the rock that night with
<>Nalaku1bara. The full moon shone bright. The radiance
<>of the moon rendered Kaila1sa and its vicinity most
<>beautiful. Filled with passion Ra1van2a could not sleep
<>at all. In the silence of that calm night he heard the
<>tinkling of bangles. Ra1van2a opened his twenty eyes
<>and looked in that direction. He saw an extremely
<>beautiful woman clad in splendid garments and orna-
<>ments going along the way. He ran to her and caught
<>hold of her hand. She was flurried and confused at his
<>sudden appearance. So she said, “Oh Lord! I am the
<>wife of Nalaku1bara who is the son of your brother
<>Kubera. My name is Rambha1. Your brother's son is
<>your son too. So don't do any harm to your son's wife.”
<>But Ra1van2a did not pay any heed to her words. He
<>lifted her up and placed her on the round rock and
<>raped her. Before dawn Rambha1, who had become
<>like the lake of lotus trodden by a mad elephant, went
<>to Nalaku1bara and told him everything. Nalaku1bara [Page520-a+ 64]
<>became very angry and cursed Ra1van2a. “You,
<>who have become blind with lust, shall not touch a
<>woman who does not reciprocate your love. If you do
<>so your head will be split into seven pieces.” It was
<>because of this curse that Ra1van2a did not touch Si1ta1
<>though she was kept in his harem. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a;
<>Maha1bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 28).
<NI>2) {%Another wife of Nalaku1bara.%} It is mentioned in
<>Katha1saritsa1gara, Madanaman5cuka1lambaka, Taran3ga
<>3, that, of the two daughters, Svayamprabha1 and
<>Somaprabha1 of Maya, Somaprabha1 was the wife of
<>Nalaku1bara.
<NI>3) {%The curse of Na1rada.%} Nalaku1bara and Man2igri1va,
<>the sons of Kubera were playing with celestial maidens
<>in the Ganges in nudity, when Na1rada came by that
<>way. The hermit was returning after visiting Vis2n2u.
<>The moment the celestial maids saw Na1rada they put
<>on their clothes and stood aside bowing before Na1rada.
<>Nalaku1bara and Man2igri1va did not see Na1rada. They
<>ran here and there, playing with no clothes on. At
<>this, Na1rada got angry and cursed them that they
<>would become two “Marutu” trees (Terminalia alata)
<>on the earth. They became very sad and requested for
<>liberation from the curse. Na1rada told them they
<>would get liberation from the curse when they saw
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, the incarnation of Vis2n2u. Accordingly
<>Nalaku1bara and his brother took birth near the house
<>of Nandagopa in Amba1d2i, as double “Marutu” trees.
<>It was the period of the childhood of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. Once
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a swallowed mud, and Yas4oda1 tied him to a
<>mortar. The child dragged the mortar to the Marutu
<>tree and got himself between the double trees. Imme-
<>diately the trees regained the original forms of
<>Nalaku1bara and Man2igri1va. They paid homage to
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a, who blessed them, and both of them
<>returned to Vais4ravan2apuri1. (Bha1gavata, Skanda 10).
<HI>NALASETU. The rock bridge built by the monkey
<>named Nala. The bridge over which S4ri1 Ra1ma and the
<>monkey-army crossed the sea to Lan3ka1 was built under
<>the supervision of Nala and so the bridge came to be
<>called Nalasetu. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 283,
<>Stanza 45).
<HI>NALATANTU. One of Vis4va1mitra's sons who were
<>expounders of Brahman. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva,
<>Chapter 4, Stanza 58).
<HI>NA1LA1YANI1. See under Pa1n5ca1li1.
<HI>NA1LA1YIRAPRABANDHAM. See under Namma1lva1r.
<HI>NALINI1. A branch of the Ganges. When the heavenly
<>Gan3ga1 came down to the earth as a result of the
<>penance of Bhagi1ratha, S4iva received it on his head. It
<>is seen in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Ba1la Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 43,
<>that when the Gan3ga1 fell drown from the head of S4iva
<>it split into seven river-arms called Hla1dini1, Pa1vani1,
<>Nalini1, Sucaks2us, Si1ta1, Sindhu and Gan3ga1. The Ganges
<>which flows through North India is one of these seven
<>river-arms.

<HI>NAMASYU. A King of Yaya1ti's family. (Bha1gavata,
<>Skandha 9).
<HI>NAMBU1TIRIS. (Malaya1la Brahmins). Logan says that
<>the Nambu1tiris were the batch of Aryans that settled
<>down in Kerala after the Nairs. The historians like
<>S4an3kun2n2i Menon and others have stated that the Nambu1-
<>tiris had come to Kerala from the banks of the rivers
<>Goda1vari1, Narmada1 and Ka1veri1. Famous historians have
<>inferred that the progress of the Aryans to the south
<>took place between 1000 and 325 B.C. But Thomas
<>Fawlks thinks that there were Nambu1tiri priests and
<>hermits in South India, during the time of Buddha.
<>N.K. Datta, the author of the book “Aryanisation of
<>India”, is of opinion that during the time of the inva-
<>sion of Alexander, the Aryans had spread all over
<>India and Ceylon. Thus historians have not yet come to
<>an agreement as to the correct period of the exodus of the
<>Aryans to the south. Anyhow in the Geography of
<>Ptolemy mention is made that half a degree east to
<>Taibis there was a place called Brahmaga1ra. It may
<>be assumed that Brahmaga1ra may be Brahma1ga1ra
<>(settlement of Brahmins). It has been decided definitely
<>that the period of Ptolemy was A.D. 2nd century, and
<>in that case the Brahmins must have settled in the
<>south before that period.
<NI>Though the period of the ‘San3gha poets and their works’
<>has been assessed differently by different scholars, the
<>majority have fixed it as the first few centuries of A.D.
<>In these San3gha poems the gods of the Aryans are
<>praised. The gods Su1rya (the Sun), Candra (the moon),
<>Varun2a (god of water), Baladeva (S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a's elder
<>brother) and Vis2n2u (Supreme God) are specially men-
<>tioned in ‘Cilappadika1ra’. The San3gha work ‘Purana1-
<>nu1ru’ is an encomium to the purity of the Vedas and
<>Agnihotra Brahmins (Brahmins who maintain the holy
<>fire by burnt offering). In those days the King carried
<>on the administration of the country with the advice
<>of Brahmins. Economics, Grammar and law were taught
<>in royal palaces. Pan5ca1ks2ara and such other spells,
<>reading of the scriptures, Aryan ways of marriage, Recita-
<>tions of Pura1n2ic stories etc. were prevalent in those days.
<>Man2imekhala1 is stated to have reached the capital
<>of the Cera King and learned Vedas and Sa1n3khya
<>doctrines (one of the six systems of Indian Philosophy
<>dealing with evolution) from the prominent teachers
<>here. The diction of both the works ‘Cilappadika1ra’ and
<>‘Man2imekhala1’ is, to a certain extent, indebted to Sans-
<>krit. Many of the Sanskrit poetic traditions are used in
<>these poems. When these proofs are taken into account,
<>it is not wrong to presume that in the period from 1st
<>century to 5th century A.D. Aryan civilization prevailed
<>in south India. If, during this period, Aryan civilization [Page522-a+ 65]
<>had taken root to such an extent in south India, the
<>advent of the Aryans to south India must have taken
<>place at least two or three centuries prior to this period.
<NI>The Nambu1tiris of Kerala are called Malaya1la
<>Brahmins. Between them and the Brahmins of other
<>countries there are differences in manners and customs.
<>They are given below:--
<NI>1) The Brahmins of other parts of India do not per-
<>form agnihotra rites (maintaining the holy fire by burnt
<>offering) so elaborately as the Malaya1la Brahmins.
<NI>2) Among the sixteen purificatory rites, Agnisvi1ka1ra (or
<>taking up of sacrificial fire) is an important item in
<>Malabar. From Vedic period Agni (Fire) had become a
<>prominent God. Most of the verses in R2gveda are con-
<>cerned with fire. The attachment of the Brahmins of
<>Kerala to fire shows their antiquity.
<NI>3) Much importance is attached to the learning of
<>scriptures and priest-hood in Kerala. There were 18
<>Mat2has and residential institutions in Kerala for giving
<>religious education.
<NI>4) The peculiar type of recitation of the Vedas of
<>the Malaya1la Brahmins and the accompanying gestures
<>of their hands and the movements of the head at the
<>time of recitation are considered by them to be ancient.
<>Even today certain sounds are produced by them in the
<>Vedic way. (For instance Samra1l--Samra1t2; Vas2ar--
<>Vasat2; I1d2e--I1le etc.).
<NI>5) In Malabar there is a customary atonement or ex-
<>piation called Vra1tyastoma for those Brahmin boys who
<>had not undergone investiture with the sacred thread
<>within the stipulated time. This shows the stress laid on
<>the need of religious education.
<NI>6) The custom that all the male members of the family
<>except the family chief should be engaged in ‘Sna1taka-
<>vr2tti’ (should remain celibates even after education) is
<>prevalent only in Malabar.
<NI>7) Much importance is attached to evening worship
<>in Kerala. At that time the Vedic gods are not hailed.
<>But Brahmins of other places do not seem to attach so
<>much importance to this practice.
<NI>8) The Brahmins outside Kerala repeat the mantras
<>uttered by the priest and perform the functions, at the
<>time of meditation and worship. But in Kerala for medi-
<>tation and worship with or without incantations a priest
<>is not necessary. This indicates the practice in vogue
<>during Vedic period before the priestly class became
<>predominant.
<NI>9) The Nambu1tiris have recognized only three Vedas.
<NI>10) The Kerala Brahmins wear only one sacred thread.
<>The Nambu1tiris became predominant in Kerala and
<>began to have a hand in the various spheres of activities.
<>Thus the Aryan civilization shook the customary faith
<>and religion of Kerala from top to bottom and the
<>Aryan religion hoisted its flag of victory here. Aryan
<>literature also found its way into Kerala. The authors
<>and scholars in Kerala began to imitate it. The Nambu1-
<>tiris erected temples in Kerala with the help of local
<>chieftains. The sounds of alphabets, sentence pattern,
<>grammar, poetic tradition etc. of Malaya1lam language
<>underwent a thorough change. Sanskrit education spread
<>far and wide. They spread Aryan civilization through
<>‘Ku1ttu and Ku1t2iya1t2t2am (Narration of mythological
<>stories with gestures etc. and collective dance) Pa1t2haka
<>and San3ghakkali (Musical lectures and dramatic per-
<>formances), in connection with festivals in the temples. [Page522-b+ 65]
<>They absorbed many of the customs and manners of
<>Kerala. The Nambu1tiris who had adopted priest-hood
<>as their career had amassed wealth and landed property
<>in the capacities of priests and authorities of the
<>temples. Some of them became Kings (e.g. King of
<>Id2appally, King of Campakas4s4eri etc.). They kept up
<>the contact with the people of the locality by means of
<>morganatic marriages and made their positions secure.
<>Thus these people, though a small minority, were able
<>to hold sway over the people of Kerala for a long
<>time.
<HI>NAMMA1LVA1R. The first of the twelve great A1lva1rs. The
<>S4aivite devotees of South India are called Na1yana1rs and
<>the Vaisn2avite devotees, A1lva1rs. The word a1lva1r means,
<>a devotee of God. The Vais2n2ava religion says that the
<>twelve a1lva1rs are the incarnations of A1dis4es2a and Garud2a
<>the followers and the embodied deities of the Conch and
<>the discus the weapons of Vis2n2u. It is mentioned
<>in S4ri1mad Bha1gavata that divine persons who are
<>followers of Vis2n2u will incarnate on the earth in Kali-
<>yuga and that their native places will be the banks of
<>the holy rivers in Dra1vid2a such as Ta1mraparn2i1, Kr2tama1la1
<>(Vaigai), Payasvini1 (Pa1pana1s4ini1) and Ka1veri1. It is
<>stated about these divine persons in Vis2n2uma1ha1tmya
<>that they would take birth in any caste and compose
<>Dra1vid2a songs and thereby propagate lofty truths. The
<>collection of Dra1vid2a songs thus composed by the
<>a1lva1rs is called ‘Divya Prabandha’ (Divine Composi-
<>tion).
<NI>There are four thousand songs in four parts in the
<>Divine composition and hence it has the name Na1la1yira
<>Prabandham ‘Four thousand composition’. The theme
<>of the 1st and 2nd thousands is a secret known as
<>‘Tirumantra’ (the divine spell). The third thousand
<>is concerned with the “Caramas4loka” (the verse of
<>death) and in the fourth “Dvayamantra” is dealt with.
<>The Tirumantra (the divine spell) is the collection of
<>of three words Om, namah2 and Na1ra1yan2a1ya.
<NI>‘Om’ and ‘namah2’ are explained in the first thousand and
<>the word Na1ra1yan2a1ya in the second thousand of the
<>composition. The Caramas4loka (the verse of death) is
<>the last utterance of the songster-priest. It is a propa-
<>gation of the theme of seeking refuge. The individual
<>soul has to seek refuge under the universal soul, un-
<>conditionally. This is what is called ‘Prapatti. Dvaya-
<>mantra (the two fold mantra) deals with the aim and
<>the ways for the realisation of that aim. It would be
<>possible only by the help of Laks2mi1 Bhagavati1 (the
<>goddess Laks2mi1). It is a verse of only two lines.
<NI>The first and foremost among the a1lva1rs is Namma1lva1r.
<>‘Tiruva1ymoli’ is his work. It had been predicted in
<>Vais2n2ava Pura1n2a that at the beginning of Kaliyuga.
<>Vis2n2u Sena1ni1 named Vis2vaksena would incarnate as
<>Namma1lva1r and that he would reinstate the Vais2n2avite
<>religion. It is hinted in Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a that
<>Namma1lva1r would incarnate in S4ri1nagari1 (Tirunagari)
<>on the banks of river Ta1mraparn2i1 in the Kingdom of
<>Pa1n2d2ya. As was fore-told Namma1lva1r was born in
<>Tirunagari. The present name of this place is ‘A1lva1r
<>tirunagari’.
<NI>There is a traditional lore about the birth of Namma1l-
<>va1r. There was a ruling chief named Ka1riya1r in Tiruna-
<>gari. Udayaman3kaya1r was his wife. The couple once
<>went to the Vais2n2avite temple near Mahendra mount-
<>ain known as Tirukkurun3kut2i temple and prayed to the [Page523-a+ 63]
<>god consecrated there called Nambi, for a son. Reply
<>was given through the priests that the god himself
<>would take birth as their son. Accordingly Udayaman3-
<>kaya1r gave birth to Namma1lva1r. Scholars say that the
<>birth of Namma1lva1r was on the 43rd day of Kailyuga-
<>that is in B.C. 3102.
<NI>Namma1lva1r had another name Para1n3kus4a. Some believe
<>that he was the incarnation of portions of Senes4a and
<>the jewel Kaustubha. Some say that there are portions
<>of Maha1vis2n2u, Pan5ca1yudha, A1dis4es2a and Senes4a in
<>Namma1lva1r. The Vais2n2avites have given Namma1lva1r a
<>lofty place. The infant born to Ka1riya1r and Udayaman3-
<>kaya1r was not an ordinary one. Generally infants at
<>birth are covered with a case of air called ‘S4at2ha’.
<>Because of this they lose the memory of previous birth.
<>But Namma1lva1r had no S4at2ha. So he got the name
<>‘S4at2hakopa’. The parents were amazed at the infant
<>which lay still without beating its legs, and crying or
<>sucking its mother's breasts. The bright infant was taken
<>to the Vais2n2avite temple on the twelfth day. Because
<>of his difference from ordinary infants he was named
<>Ma1ra. A golden cradle studded with jewels was hung
<>on the branch of a tamarind tree and laying the child
<>in it, the parents went home. That tamarind tree still
<>stands there. The devotees believe that that tree also is
<>a portion of A1dis4es2a.
<NI>Namma1lva1r spent sixteen years under the tamarind tree
<>without opening the eyes or uttering a single word. In
<>the sixteenth year a wise man who could understand
<>the dignity of Namma1lva1r came there. The person was
<>the Madhura Kavi A1lva1r. After this Namma1lva1r sat
<>under the tamarind tree and sang songs of praise of
<>Na1ra1yan2a. Madhura Kavi set tunes for them and
<>sang them. Everybody who heard them was struck with
<>wonder and stood still. Namma1lva1r spent his days
<>under the tamarind tree in meditation and contempla-
<>tion. At the age of 35 he entered heaven.
<HI>NAMUCI I. A fierce Ra1ks2asa (giant). It is stated in
<>Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza 22, that
<>this giant was the son of Praja1pati Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Danu. This fierce giant was killed by Indra. There is
<>a story in the Pura1n2as describing how Namuci was
<>killed.
<NI>Under the leadership of Namuci a great army of the
<>giants invaded the realm of the gods. Indra came with
<>an army of devas. Though the giants were defeated in
<>the battle Indra was not able to kill Namuci. To save
<>himself from the attack of Indra, Namuci got into the
<>radiance of the Sun and hid himself there. Indra found
<>him out and made a treaty with him, the conditions of
<>which were as said by Indra:--
<NI>“Oh, noble giant, I will not kill you by wet thing or
<>dry thing, in the night or in the day. What I say is
<>true.”
<NI>According to this treaty it became impossible for Indra
<>to kill Namuci either with wet things or with dry things
<>and either in the day time or in the night. Only when
<>Indra had agreed to these conditions did Namuci come
<>out.
<NI>The battle continued and Indra drove away S4umbha
<>and Nis4umbha the elder brothers of Namuci, who went
<>to Pa1ta1la. Indra ran after Namuci and in the evening
<>Indra found him hiding on the sea shore and killed him [Page523-b+ 64]
<>with the foam of the sea. As Indra had violated the condi-
<>tion of the treaty the severed head of Namuci followed
<>Indra. With this Indra incurred the sin of Brahma-
<>hatya1 (killing a Brahmin). To get remission from this
<>sin Indra approached Brahma1. He was advised to bathe
<>in Arun2a1san3gama and doing so Indra got remission of
<>his sin. From that day onwards Arun2a1san3gama became
<>a holy bath (ti1rtha). (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 40).
<HI>NAMUCI II. An army-captain of Hiran2ya1ks2a. In the
<>battle with Indra, Namuci made him unconscious and
<>the elephant Aira1vata thrust its tusks on the ground.
<>After that by his magic and sorcery he created many
<>creatures. But Vis2n2u destroyed all those creatures with
<>his discus Sudars4ana. At last Indra killed Namuci.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2ikhan2d2a).
<HI>NAMUCI III. Another valiant captain of Hiran2ya1ks2a.
<>He sent five arrows against Indra in a fierce battle. But
<>Indra cut all the five arrows in the midway. Then by
<>his magic and sorcery Namuci spread darkness every-
<>where. Indra defeated that strategy also. Then Namuci
<>dashed forward and taking hold of the tusks of Aira1vata
<>shook Indra down. Indra stood up and cut off the head
<>of Namuci with his sword. (Padma Pura1n2a, Sr2s2t2i
<>Khan2d2a).
<HI>NANAGA1BHU. A King of the family of Yaya1ti. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 9).
<HI>NANDA I. (NANDAKA). See under Nandagopa.
<HI>NANDA II. (See under Vararuci).
<HI>NANDA III. A son of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. In the battle of
<>Kuruks2etra, Bhi1masena killed him. (M.B. Karn2a
<>Parva, Chapter 51, Stanza 19).
<HI>NANDA IV. A serpent born in the family of Kas4yapa

<>12).
<HI>NANDA V. A warrior of Subrahman2ya. (M.B. S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 64).
<HI>NANDA VI. A synonym of Bhagava1n Vis2n2u. (M.B.
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 149, Stanza 69).
<HI>NANDA1 I. Wife of Hars2a the third son of Dharmadeva.
<>(M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter 66, Stanza 33).
<HI>NANDA1 II. A river. Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 214, Stanza 6, that while Arjuna
<>had been engaged in a pilgrimage visiting the holy
<>places in the east, he reached the banks of the rivers
<>Nanda1 and Aparananda1. Many of the scholars are of
<>opinion that this river flowed through the eastern side
<>of the forest Naimis2aran2ya. When the hermit Dhaumya
<>talks about the holy places of the east to Yudhis2t2hira,
<>he says as follows about the river Nanda1. “The beauti-
<>ful mountain ‘Kun2d2oda’ is a place which abounds in
<>roots, fruits and water. Nala the King of Nis2adha, who
<>was weary of thirst rested here. There is a holy temple
<>here called Devavana which is thronged by hermits.
<>Near this temple there is a mountain through the top
<>of which, two rivers Ba1huda1 and Nanda1 flow.” (M.B.
<>Vana Parva, Chapter 87).
<NI>During the time of the forest life of the Pa1n2d2avas,
<>Yudhis2t2hira travelled with the hermit Lomas4a, through
<>the basin of the rivers Nanda1, and Aparananda1. During
<>the Paura1n2ic times some deities had lived in the basin
<>of the river Nanda1, and men began to come there to
<>visit the deities. The devas (gods) did not like this and
<>so they rendered the place inaccessible to men. From
<>that time onwards the river basin of Nanda1 and the [Page524-a+ 65]
<>mount Hemaku1t2a have become prohibited area for
<>human beings. (M.B. Vana Parva, Chapter 110).
<HI>NANDABHADRA. A righteous Vais4ya. Having been
<>childless for a long time this Vais4ya, who was an ardent
<>devotee of God Kapiles4vara, got a son in his old age.
<>But he died after his marriage. With this calamity
<>Nandabhadra became a man of abstinence and began
<>to try to acquire spiritual knowledge. After a while a
<>seven-year-old boy appeared before the Vais4ya and
<>quenched his thirst for spiritual knowledge. Later with
<>meditation on S4iva and the Sun, Nandabhadra attained
<>heaven. (Skanda Pura1n2a, Chapters 1, 2 and 46).
<HI>NANDAGOPA. Foster-father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<NI>1) {%Previous birth.%} There are two stories about the
<>previous birth of Nandagopa.
<NI>(i) Dron2a, one of the eight Vasus and his wife Dha1ra1
<>once committed a mistake, not becoming the gods.
<>Brahma1 who found it out, cursed the couple to take
<>birth in the family of cowherds. Dron2a and Dha1ra1
<>prayed for remission. Brahma1 told them that Maha1-
<>vis2n2u would incarnate as their son as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and
<>that after that birth they would be liberated from the
<>curse. Accordingly Dron2a took birth as Nandagopa and
<>Dha1ra1 as Yas4oda1. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>(ii) Once a King named Candrasena sat in the Maha1-
<>ka1la temple in Ujjayini1 to perform penance. S4iva was
<>pleased at his penance and gave him a jewel. That
<>brilliant precious stone fulfilled all his desires. Other
<>kings heard about this jewel and came to war to take
<>possession of the jewel. The King came and took
<>refuge in the temple.
<NI>At this time a son named S4ri1kara was born to a cow-
<>herdess in Ujjayini1. He was god-fearing since childhood.
<>S4ri1kara came to Maha1ka1la temple and sat in worship
<>and meditation and attained the goodwill of S4iva. The
<>Kings who came in chase of Candrasena could not
<>approach the temple because of the unearthly brilliance
<>that radiated from S4ri1kara. Not knowing the reason the
<>kings stood staring and Hanu1ma1n instantly appeared
<>before them and said. “Hear this, oh Kings! S4ri1kara
<>is not a mere cowherd boy. The God is pleased with
<>him. In his eighth birth from today he will be born in
<>Amba1d2i under the name Nandagopa. Then Maha1vis2n2u
<>will incarnate as the son of Nandagopa under the name
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.”
<NI>Nandagopa was the eighth birth of this S4ri1kara. (S4iva
<>Pura1n2a, S4aniprados2ama1ha1tmya).
<NI>2) {%Varun2a carried away Nandagopa.%} While S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>was living in Amba1d2i as the foster-son of Nandagopa,
<>Nandagopa went to bathe in the river Yamuna1. While
<>he was taking a dip under the water a servant of
<>Varun2a carried him away to the realm of Varun2a. As
<>Nandagopa disappeared the people of Amba1d2i ran
<>here and there in grief. At last S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a jumped into
<>the water and reached the city of Varun2a, who praised
<>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and said that it was to see S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a that he
<>had carried Nandagopa away, and requested for
<>pardon. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a pardoned Varun2a and brought
<>Nandagopa to Amba1d2i. (Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>3) {%Nandagopa swallowed by a great mountain-snake.%} (See
<>under Kr2s2n2a, Para 21).
<HI>NANDAKA I. A tabor. Whenever the flag of Yudhi-
<>s2t2hira was hoisted, two tabors called Nandaka and
<>Upanandaka used to be beaten. (M.B. Vana Parva,
<>Chapter 27, Stanza 7). [Page524-b+ 65]
<HI>NANDAKA II. A sword of Maha1vis2n2u. (M.B. Anus4a1-
<>sana Parva, Chapter 147, Stanza 15).
<NI>There is a story explaining how Maha1vis2n2u came by
<>this sword Nandaka. In days of old Brahma1 performed
<>a sacrifice on the banks of the heavenly Gan3ga1 on a
<>peak of mount Maha1meru. While Brahma1 was sitting
<>in deep meditation in the sacrifice Loha1sura was seen
<>coming to cause disturbance to the sacrifice. Immediate-
<>ly a male being came into existence from the medi-
<>tation of Brahma1. The male being paid homage to
<>Brahma1 and the devas (gods) became glad and they
<>encouraged the male being. Because the gods greeted the
<>male one, he was changed to a sword called Nandaka
<>(that which is greeted or thanked for). That sword
<>was received by Maha1vis2n2u at the request of the gods.
<>When Maha1vis2n2u slowly took it Loha1sura came near.
<>He was an asura of blue complexion, with thousand
<>hands of adamantine fists. By wielding his club he
<>drove away the gods. Maha1vis2n2u cut down his limbs
<>one by one and those organs became metals by the
<>touch of the sword. Then Maha1vis2n2u killed the asura.
<>Then Maha1vis2n2u granted Nandaka a pure body and
<>various boons. Afterwards Nandaka became the deity
<>of weapons on the earth. Thus Brahma1, who got rid
<>of the disturbance by the aid of Vis2n2u, completed the
<>sacrifice. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 245).
<HI>NANDANA I. Son of Hiran2yakas4ipu. Nandana who
<>had been ruling over the S4veta island had obtained
<>boons from S4iva and had become invincible. He ruled
<>over the kingdom for ten thousand years and then
<>attained Kaila1sa and became a gan2a of S4iva. (S4iva
<>Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a, Chapter 2).
<HI>NANDANA II. One of the two attendants given to
<>Skandadeva by As4vini1kuma1ras. (M.B. S4a1nti Parva,
<>Chapter 44).
<HI>NANDANA III. A divine park in the world of devas
<>(gods). Mention is made in Maha1bha1rata, Anus4a1sana
<>Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 45, that those who had
<>brought the organs of senses under control and who had
<>not killed any living being, would be permitted to
<>enter this park.
<HI>NANDA1S4RAMA. A holy place. Amba1, the daughter of
<>the King of Ka1s4i1 once performed penance in this holy
<>place. (M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 186, Stanza 26).
<HI>NANDI1 I. A Deva Gandharva. He was present at the
<>birth celebration of Arjuna. (M.B. A1di Parva, Chapter
<>12, Stanza 56).
<HI>NANDI1 II. One of the divine attendants of S4iva. (See
<>under Nandikes4a).
<HI>NANDIGRA1MA. It is stated in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Ayodhya1ka1n2d2a that while S4ri1 Ra1ma had been leading
<>forest life, Bharata lived in Nandigra1ma for twelve
<>years worshipping the sandals of S4ri1 Ra1ma. This
<>Nandigra1ma is situated nearly fourteen miles away
<>from Ayodhya1. (Faizabad).
<HI>NANDIKES4A. The chief of the Bhu1ta Gan2as (the
<>attendants) of S4iva. For the story of how Nandikes4a
<>once took the form of a monkey and cursed Ra1van2a,
<>see under Ra1van2a.
<HI>NANDIKUN2D2A. A holy place. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 25, Stanza 60, it is men-
<>tioned that the sin incurred by causing abortion, will
<>be washed away by taking a bath in this holy place.
<HI>NANDINI1 I. A cow of the world of the gods (Devas).
<>(See under Ka1madhenu). [Page525-a+ 65]
<HI>NANDINI1 II. A holy place. In this place there is a
<>well esteemed by the gods. It is mentioned in Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Vana Parva, Chapter 84, Stanza 15, that those
<>who bathe in this holy well will obtain the fruits of
<>Naramedhayajn5a (human sacrifice).
<HI>NANDISENA. One of the four attendants given to
<>Subrahman2ya by Brahma1. Lohita1ks2a, Ghan2t2a1karn2a and
<>Kumudama1li1 were the other three attendants. (M.B.
<>S4alya Parva, Chapter 45, Stanza 24).
<HI>NANDI1S4VARA. See under Nandikes4a.
<HI>NANDIVARDHANA I. The name of the conch of
<>Sa1tyaki. (M.B. S4alya Parva, Chapter 61, Da1ks2in2a1tya-
<>pa1t2ha).
<HI>NANDIVARDHANA II. A King of the solar dynasty. He
<>was the son of Vi1rada and the father of Suketu. (Bha1ga-
<>vata, Skandha 9).
<HI>NANDIVEGA. A Ks2atriya family of ancient India. A
<>famous King named S4ama was born in this family.
<>(M.B. Udyoga Parva, Chapter 74. Stanza 17).
<HI>NAPTA1. An eternal god concerned with offerings to the
<>Manes. (M.B. Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 91, Stanza
<>37).
<HI>NAPUM3SAKA. (EUNUCH). Mention is made in
<>Brahma1n2d2a Pura1n2a, Chapter 48, that the semen intro-
<>duced into the womb of the woman by the man at
<>the time of coition, will get mixed with the blood in
<>the womb, and that the issue will be male, female or
<>eunuch according to the proportion of the mixture. In
<>the mixture of semen and blood, if blood exceeds semen
<>the issue will be female and if semen exceeds, it will be
<>male child and if both are equal the child will be a
<>eunuch.
<HI>NARA I. A hermit of divine power.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Brahma1 created Dharmadeva from his
<>breast. Truthful and righteous Dharma married ten
<>daughters of Daks2a. Several sons were born to Dharma
<>of his ten wives. But foremost among them were Hari,
<>Kr2s2n2a, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. Hari and Kr2s2n2a became
<>great yogins and Nara and Na1ra1yan2a became great
<>hermits of penance. The Nara-Na1ra1yan2as lived in the
<>holy Asylum of Badarika1s4rama in the vicinity of the
<>Hima1layas for a thousand years performing penance to
<>Brahma1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata. Skandha 4).
<NI>2) {%Giving birth to Urvas4i1.%} See under Urva i1, Para 1.
<NI>3) {%Keeper of Amr2ta (Ambrosia).%} The Devas (gods) and
<>the asuras (demons) together churned the sea of milk
<>and obtained Ambrosia (the celestial nectar of immortal-
<>ity). Maha1vis2n2u took the guise of a fascinating woman
<>and obtained the Amr2ta by stealth from the asuras
<>and gave it to the devas. The asuras waged a terrible
<>war with the devas. At that time, at the request of
<>the devas, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a took sides with the
<>devas, and fought against the asuras as a consequence
<>of which the asuras were defeated. In Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 19, Stanza 31, it is stated that
<>from that day ownwards Indra entrusted the keeping
<>of the celestial Nectar with the hermit named Nara.
<NI>4) {%Dambhodbhava brought under control.%} See under
<>Dambhodbhava).
<NI>5) {%Conflict with S4iva.%} Because he was not invited to the
<>sacrifice by Daks2a, S4iva got angry and sent his trident
<>against Daks2a's sacrifice. The trident completely des-
<>troyed the sacrifice and flew through the air here and
<>there. Then it reached Badarya1s4rama and hit the breast
<>of Na1ra1yan2a who was sitting engaged in penance. By [Page525-b+ 65]
<>the force of the utterance of the sound ‘Hum’, made
<>by Na1ra1yan2a, the trident was ejected from his breast.
<>Finding no accommodation there it flew back to S4iva,
<>who getting angry at this rebut approached Nara-
<>Na1ra1yan2as with the intention of exterminating them.
<>Nara took a grass from the ground and discharged it at
<>S4iva. Instantly the grass became an axe. It flew round
<>S4iva to attack him. S4iva broke the axe. From that day
<>onwards S4iva got the name ‘Khan2d2aparas4u’ (one who
<>broke the axe). In this story it is said that the trident
<>which had returned from the breast of Na1ra1yan2a heated
<>the hair of S4iva to such an extent that they were
<>dried as dry grass. So S4iva came to be called ‘Mun5ja-
<>kes4a’ (with hair having the colour of dry grass). (M.B.
<>S4a1nti Parva, Chapter 343).
<NI>6) {%Fight with Prahla1da.%} Once Cyavana the son of Bhr2gu
<>went to Na1kules4vara ti1rtha (Bath) to take his bath in
<>the river Narmada1. As soon as he got into the water
<>the serpent called Kekaralohita caught hold of him.
<>Cyavana meditated on Vis2n2u. So the poison of the ser-
<>pent did not affect him. The huge serpent dragged
<>Cyavana to Pa1ta1la (the Nether world). But as his
<>poison did not affect the hermit the serpent left the
<>prey and went away. The Na1ga damsels welcomed
<>him and showed hospitality. Being greeted by the Na1ga
<>damsels he travelled through Pa1ta1la and reached the
<>great city of Da1navas. The asura chiefs greeted him with
<>respect. Prahla1da met Cyavana, and received him with
<>pleasure. The hermit said to Prahla1da. “I came to bathe
<>in the Maha1ti1rtha and worship Na1kules4vara. When I
<>got into the river a serpent caught hold of me and
<>brought me to Pa1ta1la, and made it possible for me to
<>meet you.” Hearing these words of Cyavana the King
<>of the asuras said: “Oh good Lord! which are the holy
<>baths in the earth, the sky and the Pa1ta1la? Would you
<>be pleased to tell us?” Cyavana replied: “Oh! power-
<>ful and mighty King! The holy baths are Naimis2a on
<>the earth, Pus2kara on the sky and Cakra ti1rtha in Pa1ta1la;
<>these are the most important ones.”
<NI>The King of the Daityas decided to go to Naimis2a and
<>said:--“We must go and bathe in the Naimis2a ti1rtha.
<>We could visit and worship Vis2n2u with eyes as beautiful
<>as lotus.” Obeying the words of the King, preparations
<>were made instantly and the asuras started from Rasa1-
<>tala for Naimis2a.
<NI>The mighty host of Daityas and Da1navas reached
<>Naimis2a and bathed in the ti1rtha. After that Prahla1da
<>went to the forest for hunting. As he was walking thus
<>he saw the river Sarasvati1. Near the river there was a
<>Pine tree with very big branches, all of which were
<>covered with arrows, the head of one at the tail of ano-
<>ther. Prahla1da saw near the tree two hermits, with
<>matted hair, clad in the hide of black antelope, perform-
<>ing penance. Near them were two perfectly made divine
<>bows named S4a1rn3ga and Ajagava and two quivers which
<>would never become empty. Prahla1da questioned them
<>without knowing that they were Nara and Na1ra1yan2a.
<>The questioning ended in a contest. The hermit Nara
<>stood up and taking the bow Ajagava began sending
<>showers of arrows at Prahla1da. Prahla1da checked every
<>one of them. The hermit made his fight more severe.
<>Prahla1da also withstood it. At last pushing Nara back
<>Na1ra1yan2a came to the front. The fight between Prahla1da
<>and Na1ra1yan2a was fierce. In the end Prahla1da fell down,
<>his breast being pierced by the arrow of Na1ra1yan2a. [Page526-a+ 64]
<>Prahla1da realized that the hermit Na1ra1yan2a was none
<>but Vis2n2u. He praised Na1ra1yan2a (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 8).
<NI>7) {%Other information.%}
<NI>(i) On the occasion of the stripping of Pa1n5ca1li1 of her
<>clothes at the palace of the Kauravas, Pa1n5ca1li1 cried,
<>calling Nara and Na1ra1yan2a. (M.B. Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapter 68, Stanza 46).
<NI>(ii) Arjuna and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a were the rebirths of Nara
<>and Na1ra1yan2a. (See under Arjuna).
<NI>(iii) It is stated in Maha1bha1rata, S4a1nti Parva, Chapter
<>334, Stanza 9, that the hermit Nara was one of the
<>four incarnations taken by Maha1vis2n2u in the Manus2ya
<>yuga (age of man) of the Sva1yambhuva Manvantara.
<NI>(iv) It is mentioned in Padma Pura1n2a, Uttara Khan2d2a,
<>Chapter 2, that, of the two viz. Nara and Na1ra1yan2a,
<>Nara was of fair complexion and Na1ra1yan2a of dark
<>complexion.
<NI>(v) It was because of the curse of the hermit Bhr2gu
<>that Nara-Na1ra1yan2as took birth as Arjuna and Kr2s2n2a
<>in the Dva1parayuga. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, Skandha 4).
<NI>(vi) The meaning of the word ‘Nara’ is he who is not
<>damaged. The universal soul named Nara has created
<>water and so water got the name ‘Na1ram’. Because he
<>lives in that water which has the name Na1ram, the uni-
<>versal soul got the name Na1ra1yan2a. (Manusmr2ti, Chapter
<>1 Stanza 10).

<HI>NA1RADA I. A very famous sage of the Pura1n2as.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Na1rada was the son of Brahma1, born from
<>his lap. Brahma1 mentally created the famous saptars2is,
<>Mari1ci, An3giras, Atri, Pulastya, Vasis2t2ha, Pulaha and
<>Kratu. From Brahma1's anger was born Rudra, from his
<>lap Na1rada, from his right thumb Daks2a, from his mind
<>Sanaka and others and from his left thumb a daughter
<>called Vi1ran2i1. Daks2a wedded Vi1ran2i1. (Devi1 Bha1gavata,
<>5th Skandha).
<NI>2) {%Various births of Na1rada.%} The Pura1n2as refer to more
<>than seven prominent births of Na1rada. He was first
<>born as the son of Brahma1, and after that, on account
<>of Brahma1's curse he was born as the Gandharva called
<>Upabarhan2a. Following that he was born as the son of
<>emperor Drumila and was named Na1rada. Again born as
<>the son of Brahma1 under the name Na1rada, he married
<>Ma1lati1 and ended his life as a monkey. He was again
<>born as the son of Brahma1 and was cursed by Daks2a.
<>Afterwards he was born as the son of Daks2a and also
<>as a worm. All these births did not occur in one and [Page526-b+ 64]
<>the same Manvantara. Na1rada may be noticed doing
<>something or other in connection with the various
<>characters in the Pura1n2as. There is no other character
<>in the Pura1n2as occupying so popular a place in them as
<>Na1rada. The important five births of Na1rada are des-
<>cribed below.
<NI>(i) {%The Gandharva called Upabarhan2a.%} Na1rada born
<>from the lap of Brahma1 desired to remain a celibate.
<>But, Brahma1 suggested that he should assume responsi-
<>bility for procreation as his (Brahma1's) other sons like
<>Mari1ci and Sanaka had already become celibates.
<>Na1rada did not accept this suggestion of Brahma1 at
<>which the latter got angry and cursed Na1rada to lose
<>his knowledge and to marry fifty beautiful women.
<>Brahma1 continued:--“You will be born as a Gandharva
<>known as Upabarhan2a and will become a great music-
<>ian. You will be unrivalled in the handling of the
<>Vi1n2a1. After your death as the Gandharva you will be
<>born as the son of a servant woman, and as such you
<>will be a great devotee of Vis2n2u. Afterwards you will
<>be born as my son when I will impart knowledge to
<>you.”
<NI>There was a Gandharva called Citraketu, who performed
<>penance on the banks of the Pus2kara lake to propitiate
<>S4iva for a child. S4iva appeared and blessed Citraketu
<>to the effect that Na1rada, the son of Brahma1, would be
<>born as his son. Accordingly the wife of Citraketu
<>delivered a son whom the family priest named Upa-
<>barhan2a. The boy grew up as a devotee of Vis2n2u. Br2has-
<>pati taught him the worship of Hari (Vis2n2u). Upabar-
<>han2a lived on the slopes of the Hima1layas performing
<>penance. While Upabarhan2a was one day engaged in Sa-
<>ma1dhi fifty daughters of the Gandharva called Citraratha
<>passed that way, and they fell in love with Upabarhan2a,
<>who was in Sama1dhi. He awoke from Sama1dhi on hearing
<>the melodious songs of the fifty damsels who stood there
<>with palms joined in reverence. Upabarhan2a too fell in
<>love with them, and he married all the fifty girls. He
<>returned with them to the palace and lived there for
<>thousands of years. Once the Gandharvas and the
<>Apsaras were invited to sing the story of Vis2n2u in
<>Brahmaloka. Upabarhan2a accompanied them. He be-
<>came lustful towards Rambha1. The Praja1patis, who
<>noticed it got angry, and Upabarhan2a well-nigh dead
<>due to their curse returned home. He told his wives all
<>that had happened to him. He spread a darbha grass
<>on the ground and lay on it and died. Ma1lati1, the eldest
<>of his wives, got ready to curse Brahma1, Yama and
<>Mr2tyu. In great consternation they sought refuge under
<>Vis2n2u, who comforted and sent them back to Ma1lati1.
<>They saluted her. Then a brahmin, who went there
<>questioned Brahma1 about the death of Upabarhan2a.
<>The brahmin told him that, according to previous deci-
<>sion, life for another thousand years remained for Upa-
<>barhan2a, but he died in the meantime on account of
<>the curse of Praja1pati. Immediately the brahmin assumed
<>the form of Vis2n2u. The brahmin blessed Upabarhan2a
<>who woke up from death rubbing his eyes. He lived
<>happily at home with his wives. He was blessed with
<>children and grandchildren. Knowing that his end was
<>near Upabarhan2a and Ma1lati1 spent their time in
<>austerities on the banks of the Gan3ga1. At last Upabar-
<>han2a expired, and Ma1lati1 ended her life in his funeral
<>pyre. (Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha). [Page527-a+ 65]
<NI>(ii) {%Son of Kala1vati1.%} There lived in Ka1nyakubja the
<>emperor called Drumila. He, along with his wife
<>Kala1vati1, performed penance on theb anks of the Gan3ga1
<>for an offspring. Kala1vati1 pleased Kas4yapa, by her
<>worship and with his blessing she became pregnant.
<>Drumila, who in the meantime had renounced every-
<>thing in life, decided to spend the rest of his life in the
<>forest itself. He gifted away all his wealth to brahmins
<>and died in the forest. Though Kala1vati1 got ready to
<>follow him in the funeral pyre, a celestial voice stopped
<>her and she refrained from committing self-immolation.
<>She returned to the village and lived as a slave in a
<>brahmin's house. In due course of time she delivered a
<>son. On the birth of the child it rained in the land
<>which was suffering from failure of rains, and because
<>of that the brahmin master of Kala1vati1 named the child
<>Na1rada, meaning he who gives water. When the child
<>Na1rada grew up he told his mother the story about his
<>former birth. He turned out to be a great devotee of
<>Vis2n2u. Meanwhile, Kala1vati1, who went to milk the
<>cow one night, was bitten to death by a snake, and
<>Na1rada was orphaned. S4iva and three attendants of his
<>who went there in disguise were pleased at Na1rada's
<>great devotion for Vis2n2u and his service-mentality. He
<>lived on the left-overs given by them. He repeated songs
<>sung by them about Vis2n2u. Gradually Na1rada became
<>perfect devotee of Vis2n2u and a unique master of music.
<>S4iva and others imparted Bha1gavata to Na1rada before
<>they left him. Na1rada who thus attained divine know-
<>ledge performed penance for many years on the banks of
<>the Gan3ga1 and died there. (Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha).
<NI>(iii) {%Birth as Kapi (Monkey).%} Na1rada, who expired on
<>the banks of the Gan3ga1 was again born as the son of
<>Brahma1. Though the father wanted the son to get
<>married the latter preferred to spend his days in the medi-
<>tation on God. Brahma1 then told his son as follows:--
<>“Why are you so much afraid of the house-holder's life?
<>Many people have attained salvation by following the
<>four a1s4ramas (stages in life) like that of the celibate,
<>the house-holder, the anchorite and the sannya1sin. In
<>fact, only such people will be able to serve man and
<>God. A girl named Ma1lati1 alias Damayanti1 is born to
<>mahars2i San5jaya, and S4iva has granted her the
<>boon that in this birth you will become her husband.
<>You, therefore, go to Narana1ra1yan2as engaged in penance
<>on the Hima1layas. They will give Ma1lati1 in marriage
<>to you.”
<NI>Accordingly Na1rada went to Badarika1s4rama where in the
<>presence of Narana1ra1yan2as he married Ma1lati1.
<NI>During those days Na1rada and sage Parvata started on
<>a pilgrimage in the course of which they went to the
<>palace of emperor San5jaya to observe Ca1turma1sya. The
<>emperor left a well-furnished house at the disposal of the
<>pilgrims. He also deputed his daughter Damayanti1 to
<>serve them. The humble service of Damayanti1 pleased
<>them both. But, Damayanti1's devotion towards Na1rada
<>was more ardent and both of them noticed this fact.
<>One day Parvata asked Na1rada whether Damayanti1
<>did not take a special interest in him (Na1rada) and to
<>this Na1rada answered ‘Yes, I too think so{??}. Parvata
<>got angry at this answer of Na1rada and told him thus:
<>“We had agreed at the time when we started on this
<>tour to divulge all secrets to each other Now you have
<>broken that contract. Why did you not tell me about
<>Damayanti1's partiality for you? You become, therefore, [Page527-b+ 65]
<>a monkey”. Na1rada, in turn, cursed Parvata as follows:
<>“You will live in hell in Yamaloka for a hundred
<>years.”
<NI>Accordingly Na1rada became a monkey and Parvata
<>lived in hell. At this juncture San5jaya's ministers
<>advised him to marry his daughter to a prince, and the
<>news made her very sad. San5jaya understood the reason
<>for his daughter's sadness from her nurse. The father
<>had ultimately to yield to her wishes and Damayanti1
<>married Na1rada, who had been turned into a monkey.
<>Hundred years rolled by, and Parvata, the period of
<>his curse being over, returned to the palace of San5jaya.
<>Na1rada treated Parvata duly well, and pleased at the
<>treatment, he gave redemption to Na1rada from the
<>curse. Na1rada lived very happily with Damayanti1 for a
<>long time at the palace, and after the demise of
<>Damayanti1 he attained Brahmaloka. (Bha1gavata, 7th
<>Skandha).
<NI>(iv) {%Born as Daks2a's son.%} After the creation of the
<>Devas was over, Brahma1 called Daks2a to him and asked
<>him to marry Vi1ran2i1 and procreate, and Daks2a
<>accordingly begot five thousand sons of Vi1ran2i1. They
<>were called Haryas4vas Finding that the Haryas4vas also
<>were interested in the procreation of children Na1rada,
<>the Devars2i, approached and told them as follows:--
<>“Oh! Haryas4vas! You who are exceptionally vital
<>people seem to be trying to procreate children. But, you
<>have not enquired as to whether there is enough space
<>on earth for such large numbers of people. You are just
<>like children who know nothing about the world. How
<>will you procreate people? Since you could live absolute-
<>ly free in the sky, why do you not find out the limit of
<>the earth?”
<NI>The Haryas4vas thereupon ran away in different places
<>to find out the limit of the earth, and they have not,
<>like the rivers which entered the ocean, returned yet.
<NI>At the loss of the Haryas4vas in the above manner,
<>Daks2a created the S4abala1s4vas, whom also Na1rada sent
<>away to various parts of the earth. Daks2a again created
<>five thousand people whom also Na1rada drove away in
<>the above manner. Angry and sad at this, Daks2a cursed
<>Na1rada thus:--“Well, Na1rada! my children roam
<>about like this because of you. Therefore, you too in
<>future will be roaming about without a permanent
<>abode. Moreover, you will have rebirth as my son.”
<NI>Na1rada became a world-trotter on account of the above
<>curse of Daks2a. He was also reborn as the son of Daks2a.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 7th Skandha and Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part
<>1, Chapter 15).
<NI>(v) {%Born as a worm.%} There is a story about Na1rada
<>being born as a worm. On the approach of a chariot
<>the worm moved quickly away from its route lest its
<>wheel should crush it to death. The King seated in
<>the chariot burst out into laughter at the above sight
<>when the worm told him as follows:--“There is nothing
<>to be laughed at in my action. In every birth the body
<>is much dear to the a1tman (soul). Just as you love
<>your body I also love and protect my body. (Maha1-
<>bha1rata).
<NI>3) {%Vis2n2u showed Na1rada the function of Ma1ya1.%} See under
<>Ta1ladhvaja I
<NI>4) {%Na1rada became a woman.%} While staying once with
<>Kr2s2n2a at Dva1raka1, Na1rada and the former went out on
<>a tour in an aerial chariot. On the way they saw a
<>stream and Kr2s2n2a stopped the chariot there as Na1rada [Page528-a+ 65]
<>wanted to quench his thirst at the stream. Na1rada drank
<>water from the stream disobeying Kr2s2n2a's injunction that
<>he should bathe before drinking water, and lo! the next
<>moment Na1rada was turned into a woman and when ‘she’
<>looked around neither Kr2s2n2a nor the chariot was to be
<>seen. She wandered about in the forest and at last reached
<>an a1s4rama. When the R2s2i of the a1s4rama awoke from his
<>sama1dhi he saw standing before him a beautiful woman
<>who requested him to accept her as his disciple. He readi-
<>ly granted her request. The preceptor married the disci-
<>ple and in due course of time she became the mother of
<>sixty children. One day all the sixty children and their
<>father expired together. The grief-stricken widow felt too
<>weak to perform the obsequies of the dead. An extraordi-
<>nary hunger also held her in its grips. She raised her hand
<>to pluck a fruit from the mango tree that stood nearby
<>but could not reach the mango above. She placed
<>together the corpses one on the other, mounted upon
<>the heap of dead bodies and plucked the mango-fruit
<>Immediately a brahmin arrived on the spot and exhorted
<>the widow on the impropriety of taking food without
<>bathing after the death of husband and children. Then
<>the widow entered the stream and dived in its waters
<>holding above water the hand in which was held the
<>mango, and lo! it was Na1rada who came out from the
<>water. Only the hand, which had been held above
<>water and did not therefore get wet, remained like that
<>of a woman with bangles thereon. The brahmin, who stood
<>there on the banks of the stream transformed himself into
<>Kr2s2n2a. As ordered by Kr2s2n2a Na1rada again dived with the
<>whole of his body in the water when the hand also
<>turned into that of a man. The mango held in the hand
<>turned into an excellent Vi1n2a1. And Kr2s2n2a told Na1rada:
<>“The R2s2i who lived with you as your husband and
<>who is no more is Ka1lapurus2a, and the sixty children
<>are years Prabhava, Vibhava etc.
<NI>Kr2s2n2a and Na1rada then returned to Dva1raka1. (Bha1ga-
<>vata. 7th Skandha).
<NI>5) {%Na1rada met the woman called Bhakti.%} When Kalika1la
<>held the earth in its grips Na1rada, on a particular
<>occasion, went round the world viewing the evils
<>of Kali, and he saw a young woman immersed in grief
<>sitting on the banks of the Yamuna1, the sports field of
<>Kr2s2n2a. On both sides of her two old men were breath-
<>ing in an unconscious state, and the woman, weeping
<>was trying to restore them to consciousness. Many
<>other women were fanning the unconscious men and
<>trying to comfort the woman. Na1rada approached the
<>young woman when she spoke to him as follows: ‘Oh!
<>great sage, please put an end to my grief, because your
<>words will remove all grief. I am called Bhakti and
<>these two old men are my sons, one of whom is known
<>as Jn5a1na (knowledge) and the other Vaira1gya (renun-
<>ciation), and they have become old due to the impact
<>of time. The others found here are sacred rivers, who
<>have come to serve me. But, the service of nobody will
<>do me good.
<NI>I was born in the Dra1vid2a region, grew up in Karn2a1t2aka,
<>lived here and there in Maha1ra1s2t2ra and became old at
<>Gujarat whereat, atheists due to the evil of Kali inflict-
<>ed wounds on me for a long time so that I became
<>very weak. I did then go with my sons to the worship-
<>ful Vr2nda1vana where I regained my old form and
<>became a young woman in the shape of a ghost. My
<>children suffer here in an unconscious state and I have [Page528-b+ 65]
<>to leave this for another place. I am so very sad that
<>my sons have become old. Why did I become a young
<>woman when my sons were old people? We three were
<>touring together, and how then did this difference arise
<>with regard to us? Is it not the proper thing for the
<>mother to be older, and her children younger? You
<>will please explain the reason for all these.”
<NI>Na1rada read out the Vedas and the Veda1n3gas to her,
<>to no purpose. Then Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatkuma1ra,
<>Sanatsuja1ta and others (all of them the mental off-
<>springs of Brahma1 and gifted with eternal youth) asked
<>Na1rada to read out Bha1gavata to the sons of Bhakti.
<>Na1rada did so, and they became immediately young.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Uttarakhan2d2a).
<NI>6) {%Tested S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.%} Kr2s2n2a was living in Dva1raka1 with
<>his 16008 wives. Na1rada once wanted to know how
<>Kr2s2n2a managed to maintain so many wives without
<>any difficulty or quarrels among them. To test it he
<>first went to the palace of Rukmin2i1 where both Kr2s2n2a
<>and herself welcomed and treated him duly. Na1rada
<>next visited Satyabha1ma1's house where also Kr2s2n2a and
<>herself welcomed and treated him well. In the houses
<>of all the 16008 wives of Kr2s2n2a, Na1rada had the same
<>experience as above. He was wonder-struck at the
<>divine powers of Kr2s2n2a and returned home praising
<>Kr2s2n2a (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>7) {%Maha1vis2n2u put down Na1rada's haughtiness.%} Na1rada
<>had been very proud about his greatness as a musician.
<>Vis2n2u decided to put an end to this conceit of Na1rada
<>for which purpose he took Na1rada to a forest. There
<>they saw many women, whose limbs had been cut, crying
<>on account of insufferable pain. Maha1vis2n2u asked the
<>women who they were and why their limbs were cut.
<>They answered Vis2n2u that they were Ra1gin2i1s, the
<>presiding deities over the various tunes and that they
<>were reduced to their present plight by the totally
<>erroneous singing of the tunes by Na1rada.
<NI>Na1rada hung his head down in shame at the above
<>answer of the women and he was cured of his conceit.
<>(Adbhuta Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>8) {%Hanu1ma1n shamed Na1rada.%} Na1rada once met Hanu1-
<>ma1n, who sang a song for him. Enjoying the music
<>Na1rada placed his Vi1n2a1 on a rock which had been
<>melted by the song of Hanu1ma1n, and Na1rada's
<>Vi1n2a1 sank into the melted rock. When the singing by
<>Hanu1ma1n was over, the rock, as of old, became hard
<>again and the Vi1n2a1 got stuck up with it. Hanu1ma1n
<>asked Na1rada to melt the rock again with a song of his
<>and take away his Vi1n2a1. Na1rada sang and sang, all to
<>no purpose. The rock did not melt again. Then Hanu1-
<>ma1n sang a song and the rock melted. After praising
<>Hanu1ma1n Na1rada left the place ashamed. (Adbhuta
<>Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>9) {%S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a instructed Na1rada about Ma1ya1.%} Na1rada once
<>requested Kr2s2n2a to teach him about Ma1ya1 (illusion)
<>and Kr2s2n2a told him that he would be taught sometime
<>later. Afterwards, one day while Na1rada was walking
<>about, it began to rain and he took shelter from the rain
<>in a hut near at hand. There was a beautiful young woman
<>in the hut and Na1rada fell in love with her. Na1rada
<>lived with her for many years and a number of children
<>were born to them. But, a flood washed the mother and
<>children off into the sea, and Na1rada was grief-stricken.
<>Then Kr2s2n2a appeared there and asked Na1rada whether
<>he loved Ma1ya1. Na1rada confessed that he understood [Page529-a+ 63]
<>Ma1ya1 very well and requested Kr2s2n2a to save him from
<>attachments on account of Ma1ya1.
<NI>10) {%Na1rada and Sanatkuma1ra.%} Once Na1rada went to
<>Sanatkuma1ra and requested him to instruct him in spirit-
<>ual wisdom telling the latter that he had already learnt
<>the Vedas and all other scriptures and arts. Sanat-
<>kuma1ra accordingly taught him about the perfect
<>nature, without either beginning or end, of supreme
<>bliss. He taught Na1rada thus: “Everything is God.
<>God exists in all animate and inanimate objects, and
<>God is superior to everything.” (Cha1ndogyopa-
<>nis2ad).
<NI>11) {%Other information about Na1rada.%}
<NI>(1) Once Brahma1 advised him sixteen names which
<>would wash off all the evils of Kali, i.e. Hare Ra1ma
<>Hare Ra1ma Ra1ma Ra1ma Hare Hare, Hare Kr2s2n2a Hare
<>Kr2s2n2a Kr2s2n2a Kr2s2n2a Hare Hare. (Kalisantaran2o-
<>panis2ad).
<NI>(2) It was Na1rada who gave the impetus to Va1lmi1ki
<>for the composition of Ra1ma1yan2a. Once Va1lmi1ki asked
<>Na1rada, who had returned after a tour of the three
<>worlds, who the greatest of men was. Na1rada replied
<>‘S4ri1 Ra1ma’ and related to Va1lmi1ki a brief history of
<>Ra1ma. Na1rada departed from there and Va1lmi1ki went
<>to the banks of the river Tamasa1. It was there that
<>Va1lmi1ki, at the sight of a hunter shooting down one
<>of the Kraun5ca birds, sang the famous verse ‘Ma1nis2a1da’
<>etc. (See under Va1lmi1ki).
<NI>(3) Na1rada once went to Veda Vya1sa, who was very un-
<>happy because he had no children. Questioned by Vya1sa
<>as to the means to have a son Na1rada advised him to
<>worship Para1s4akti (the supreme power). Accordingly
<>Vya1sa worshipped Para1s4akti at Kaila1sa and was gifted
<>with the son S4uka. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 1st Skandha),
<NI>(4) When once Na1rada came to Vaikun2t2ha playing on
<>his Vi1n2a1 Laks2mi1devi1 went bashfully into the inner
<>apartment. In fact, she felt some love towards Na1rada
<>who asked Vis2n2u for the reason thereof. Vis2n2u replied
<>that none existed who had absolutely conquered Ma1ya1
<>(illusion) and that Laks2mi1devi1 felt love towards Na1rada
<>for a few moments because of the influence of Ma1ya1.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 6th Skandha).
<NI>(5) Once Agastya kicked down mount Vindhya and
<>Na1rada had also a small share in it. Vindhya had risen
<>above the path of the sun as Na1rada told him queru-
<>lously that the Sun was circling Maha1meru and was
<>ignoring Vindhya. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>(6) Na1rada once went to Pa1ta1laloka and returned after
<>having been duly treated as guest by Prahla1da. (Brahma
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 23).
<NI>(7) Na1rada once cursed Nalaku1bara and Man2igri1va
<>(sons of Kubera) and turned them into two trees. They
<>regained their former form on being touched by the
<>mortar drawn by Kr2s2n2a as a boy. (See under Nala-
<>ku1bara).
<NI>(8) It was Na1rada who told Kam3sa that S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was
<>in Amba1d2i. He also told Kam3sa about his previous his-
<>tory. (Bha1gavata, 10th Skandha).
<NI>(9) Vr2ka1sura once asked Na1rada who amongst the Tri-
<>mu1rtis used to be pleased most easily and Na1rada men-
<>tioned S4iva. It was therefore that the asura performed
<>penance to S4iva and pleased him. (Bha1gavata, 10th
<>Skandha). [Page529-b+ 63]
<NI>(10) The following story occurs in the Va1yu Pura1n2a
<>as to how Na1rada's Vi1n2a1 became the musical instrument
<>of the world. Once Na1rada was in Indra's court when
<>the latter asked Urvas4i1 to give a dance performance.
<>She did so and in the course of the dance saw Jayanta,
<>son of Indra seated before her. She was swept over by
<>a passion towards Jayanta as a result of which some
<>mistakes were made by her in dancing. Na1rada, who
<>was playing his Vi1n2a1 called Mahati1, also committed
<>some mistakes. Na1rada did so to attract the attention
<>of the audience to Urvas4i1's mistakes. Noticing the mis-
<>take Agastya, who too was present on the occasion,
<>cursed Urvas4i1 to become a bamboo. He cursed that
<>Na1rada's Vi1n2a1 should become the Vi1n2a1 of the world
<>(Va1yu Pura1n2a).
<NI>(11) Na1rada's curse was also one of the causes for
<>Ra1van2a's death. Ra1van2a once requested Na1rada to ex-
<>plain to him the meaning of ‘Om’, and when Na1rada
<>refused to oblige him he threatened to cut Na1rada's
<>tongue. Na1rada in return cursed that the ten heads
<>of Ra1van2a would be cut. (Kamba Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha
<>Ka1n2d2a).
<NI>(12) During one Kalpa, Na1rada was born as a Deva-
<>gandharva as the son of Kas4yapa by his wife Muni.
<>(A1di Parva, Chapter 1 and Svarga1rohan2a Parva,

<>which included three lakhs of s4lokas. (Maha1bha1rata,
<>A1di Parva, Chapter 1; Svarga1rohan2a Parva, Chapter 5).
<NI>(14) Since he imparted Sa1n3khya wisdom to the sons
<>of Daks2a they renounced the world and departed for
<>different places. (A1di Parva, Chapter 75, Verse 7).
<NI>(15) He was present at the birthday celebrations of
<>Arjuna. (A1di Parva, Chapter 122, Verse 57).
<NI>(16) He also was present in the company of Devas and
<>women, who attended Pa1n5ca1li1's Svayam3vara. (A1di

<NI>(17) After Pa1n5ca1li1's Syayam3vara he once went to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas at Indraprastha and advised the five brothers
<>not to quarrel over Pa1n5ca1li1. It was he, who told them
<>the story of the Sundopasundas. He also arranged that
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 should live by turns of one year each with each of
<>the five Pa1n2d2ava brothers. (A1di Parva, Chapter 207,
<>Verse 9).
<NI>(18) It was he who consoled and sent the apsaras called
<>Varga1, who was in the grip of a curse, to the south.
<>(See under Varga1).
<NI>(19) In the form of a catechism he gave advice on
<>various topics to Dharmaputra. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter
<>5).
<NI>(20) When proposals for building a palace at Indra-
<>prastha for the Pa1n2d2avas were under discussion Na1rada
<>went there and gave descriptions of the courts of Indra,
<>Yama, Varun2a, Kubera and Brahma1. (Sabha1 Parva,
<>Chapters 5-11).
<NI>(21) He related the story of Haris4candra to Dharma-
<>putra. (Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 12, Verse 23).
<NI>(22) It was he who conveyed the information to
<>Dva1raka1 that Kr2s2n2a's grandson Aniruddha was imprison-

<>va1sikaparva, Chapters 37-39. [Page531-a+ 65]
<HI>NA1RADI1. One of the Brahmava1di1 sons of Vis4va1mitra.
<>(Anus4a1sana Parva, Chapter 4, Verse 59).
<HI>NA1RADI1YAPURA1N2A. One of the eighteen Pura1n2as.
<>(See under Pura1n2as).
<HI>NARAKA I. (NARAKA1SURA). A valiant Asura.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Once the Asura Hiran2ya1ks2a was amusing
<>himself by wading through the ocean and beating at
<>the waves with his club. Varun2a, the god of water, was
<>alarmed at this and ran to Maha1vis2n2u and told him
<>every thing. Hearing this Maha1vis2n2u got up to kill
<>Hiran2ya1ks2a. Hiran2ya1ks2a who had assumed the form of
<>a Boar carried the earth on his tusks and ran to Pa1ta1la.
<>As the goddess earth had come into contact with the
<>tusks of Hiran2ya1ks2a she became pregnant and gave birth
<>to an asura infant of immense might and power. That
<>infant was Naraka1sura.
<NI>Taking the infant born from impurity the sad goddess
<>Earth went to Maha1vis2n2u and requested him to save
<>the child somehow. Maha1vis2n2u pitied him and gave
<>him Na1ra1yan2a1stra (Na1ra1yan2a's weapon) and said:
<>“Naraka! So long as this weapon is with you, nobody
<>but me could kill you.” Saying this he disappeared.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<NI>2) {%Administration.%} Naraka1sura made Pra1gjyotis2a his
<>capital and ruled over the asuras as their emperor for
<>a long time, all the while terrifying the Devas. Once
<>this asura raped Kas4eru1 the daughter of Tvas2t2a1. He
<>brought sixteen thousand and one hundred maidens
<>from the women of the earth and the world of gods. He
<>made them captives at Audaka on the top of the
<>mountain Man2iparvata. He appointed four mighty and
<>fearful asuras: Hayagri1va, Nisunda, Pan5canada and
<>Mura as gate-keepers of Pra1gjyotis2a. As they stood
<>blocking the way up to Devaya1na, nobody dared to
<>enter Pra1gjyotis2a. The ten sons of Naraka1sura guarded
<>the harem. At the boundary of the country Mura1sura
<>had tied six thousand ropes with a sword at the end of
<>each. So enemies dared not come near the boundary.
<>When Sugri1va gave instructions to the monkeys who
<>were sent in search of Si1ta1, about the route they were
<>to follow, he had mentioned about the city of Pra1g-
<>jyotis2a. Mention is made in Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a,
<>Kis2kindha1 Ka1n2d2a, Sarga 42 that Sugri1va had given
<>them special instructions to search for Si1ta1 in Pra1g-
<>jyotis2a. (M.B. Vis2n2u Parva, Chapter 63).
<NI>3) {%Previous birth of Naraka.%} Long ago a king who was
<>the father of Sixteen thousand daughters, ruled over a
<>country. While the father and daughters were sitting in
<>the palace Maha1vis2n2u came there as a hermit. The
<>sixteen thousand damsels gathered round the hermit.
<>Their father got angry and cursed them. The daughters
<>shed tears and entreated their father for liberation from
<>the curse. He gave them remission and said that in the
<>next birth they would become wives of Maha1vis2n2u.
<NI>Another version of this story says that the damsels had
<>requested Brahma1 for liberation from the curse
<>according to the advice of the hermit Na1rada, and
<>that Brahma1 had given them liberation from the curse.
<>In some versions it is stated that Na1rada himself gave
<>them liberation from the curse.
<NI>It was this King, who was the father of the sixteen
<>thousand damsels, who took birth again as Naraka1sura.
<>Those sixteen thousand damels who had been born as
<>princesses in different places were taken captives by
<>Naraka1sura and were kept in Audaka. (Bha1gavata, [Page531-b+ 65]
<>Skandha 10).
<NI>4) {%Death.%} Naraka1sura who had been causing devast-
<>ation and terror in the three worlds entered the world
<>of the gods once. The gods were not able to withstand
<>the fury of Naraka, who carried away the ear-rings of
<>Aditi, the mother of Indra, and the large white royal
<>umbrella of Indra to Pra1gjyotis2a. Indra went to Dva1raka1
<>and told S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a of the molestations he had received
<>at the hands of Naraka1sura. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a rode on his
<>Garud2a with his wife Satyabha1ma1 to Pra1gjyotis2a. They
<>flew over the city round and understood the lay-out of
<>the city, and the precautions taken by Naraka1sura. The
<>battle began after this reconnaissance. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a,
<>Satyabha1ma1 and Garud2a fought with the asuras. The
<>might asuras such as Mura, Ta1mra, Antari1ks2a, S4ravan2a,
<>Vasu, Vibha1vasu, Nabhasva1n, Arun2a and others were
<>killed. At last Naraka1sura himself entered the battle-
<>field. A fierce battle ensued in which Naraka was killed.
<>The divine weapon Na1ra1yan2a1stra of Naraka was given
<>to his son Bhagadatta. After the battle S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and
<>Satyabha1ma1 went to the world of the gods and returned
<>the ear-rings to Aditi and the umbrella to Indra.
<>(Bha1gavata, Skandha 10).
<HI>NARAKA II. Mention is made about another Naraka1-
<>sura who was born to Praja1pati Kas4yapa by his wife
<>Danu, in Maha1bha1rata, A1di Parva, Chapter 65, Stanza
<>28. Once Indra defeated this Naraka1sura. It is seen in
<>Maha1bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 9 that this asura
<>after his death, stayed in the palace of Varun2a worship-
<>ping him.
<HI>NARAKA III. Bhagadatta the son of Naraka1sura ruled
<>over the part of Pa1ta1la called Naraka, and being the
<>ruler of Naraka, Bhagadatta seems to have been known
<>by the name of Naraka also.
<HI>NARAKA. IV. See under Ka1la I.
<HI>NARANA1RA1YAN2AS. Two hermits Nara and Na1ra1yan2a.
<>These two hermits had spent many thousands of years in
<>Badarya1s4rama doing penance. Arjuna was the rebirth of
<>Nara and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was the rebirth of Na1ra1yan2a. (For
<>detailed story see under Nara and Na1ra1yan2a).
<HI>NARA1NTAKA I. A captain of the army of Ra1van2a. It
<>is stated in Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 10, that the captains of
<>Ra1van2a, viz., Kumbha, Nikumbha, Makara1ks2a,
<>Mahodara, Maha1pa1rs4va, Matta, Unmatta, Pragha1sa,
<>Bha1sakarn2a, Viru1pa1ks2a, Deva1ntaka, Nara1ntaka, Tris4iras,
<>Atika1ya and other Ra1ks2asas fought on the side of
<>Ra1van2a against S4ri1 Ra1ma and that all of them were
<>killed.
<NI>Of these Deva1ntaka and Nara1ntaka were mighty and
<>valiant warriors. An3gada killed Nara1ntaka after a
<>fierce battle. (Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a, Yuddha Ka1n2d2a,
<>Chapter 69).
<HI>NARA1NTAKA II. Son of Rudraketu, an asura. This
<>asura terrorized the three worlds by his wicked and
<>cruel deeds. When the wickedness and cruelty of this
<>asura became unbearable Gan2apati incarnated in the
<>house of Kas4yapa to protect the three worlds. Knowing
<>this Nara1ntaka resorted to various means to kill
<>Gan2apati. But his attempts were futile. Finally he was
<>killed by Gan2apati. (Gan2es4a Pura1n2a).
<HI>NARARA1S2T2RA. A kingdom of ancient India. In Maha1-
<>bha1rata, Sabha1 Parva, Chapter 31, Stanza 6, it is
<>mentioned that Sahadeva one of the Pa1n2d2avas, con-
<>quered this country.
<HI>NARASIM3HA. See under Avata1ra. [Page532-a+ 65]
<HI>NARAVA1HANA. A Ks2atriya King who had obtained
<>remission of the sin of Brahmahatya1 (slaughter of
<>Brahmin) by taking the fast of Vais4a1khavrata.
<NI>This man who was a Ks2atriya of Pa1n5ca1la once
<>happened to kill a Brahmin with an arrow. To get
<>remission of this sin, he discarded his Sacred thread,
<>mark on the forehead and forelock and had been
<>wandering here and there when he met a Brahmin
<>named Munis4arma1. Narava1hana told him his story.
<>This Bra1hman2a who was a lover of God advised him
<>regarding the importance of the Vais4a1kha fast. By
<>taking this fast the King obtained remission of sin.
<>(Padma Pura1n2a, Chapter 88).
<HI>NARAVA1HANADATTA. A famous Vidya1dhara.
<>Udayana the King of Vatsa had been spending his time
<>in play and pleasure with his wives Padma1vati1 and
<>Va1savadatta1, when once Na1rada appeared before them.
<>The king greeted the hermit and showed hospitality.
<>The King and the queens were childless. Na1rada told
<>them: “Hear, oh King. Your wife Va1savadatta1 is the
<>incarnation of Ratidevi1 blessed by S4iva. The son born
<>to her would become the emperor of the Vidya1dharas.
<>Not long after this Va1savadatta1 conceived and gave
<>birth to a radiant son. He was named Narava1hana-datta.
<>At this time Kalin3gasena1, who had been transformed into
<>a woman by the curse of Indra, gave birth to an
<>extra-ordinarily beautiful girl. (For detailed story see
<>under Kalin3gasena1). That child was named Madana-
<>man5cuka1. Even in infancy she was surrounded by a halo
<>of unearthly beauty. Hearing of this child, Va1savadatta1
<>brought Kalin3gasena1 and tbe infant to the palace. To
<>the wonder of everybody, the infants looked at each
<>other and they were not satisfied how soever long they
<>looked at each other. The king and his wives under-
<>stood this perfectly well and at the proper time their
<>marriage was conducted.
<NI>Narava1hanadatta was anointed as the Heir-apparent.
<>Once he was playing in the garden in the spring season,
<>with his ministers Gomukha and others, when the most
<>beautiful Ratnaprabha1 came there. (See under Ratna-
<>prabha1).
<NI>Once Narava1hanadatta went for hunting with his
<>minister Gomukha and retinue. Somehow or other he
<>was separated from Gomukha and army in the deep
<>forest. Then he heard a divine song and sound of a
<>heavenly lyre. He went in the direction from which
<>the music came. and reached a S4aivite temple. Getting
<>in, he saw an excessively beautiful damsel standing in
<>the midst of her attendants and companions singing
<>and playing on a lute, in praise of S4iva. At this time a
<>grown-up Vidya1dhara woman came down from the sky
<>and getting near the damsel, gave her to Narava1hana-
<>datta. The name of the Vidya1dhara damsel was
<>Alan3ka1ravati1. (For other details see under Alan3ka1ra-
<>vati1).
<NI>As Narava1hanadatta was spending his days, enjoying the
<>pleasing company of his wife Alan3ka1ravati1, once he
<>went for hunting, with his army. Being very tired they
<>went in search of water, and entered a thick forest.
<>There they saw a lake full of golden lotus flowers and
<>four men plucking flowers. Narava1hanadatta approached
<>them. They said that they had been plucking flowers
<>to worship Vis2n2u. Narava1hana followed them to the
<>presence of Vis2n2u. Maha1vis2n2u was greatly pleased at
<>Narava1hanadatta who was standing with folded hands [Page532-b+ 65]
<>singing praises of Vis2n2u in intense devotion and blessed
<>him to become the emperor of the Vidya1dharas.
<>(Katha1saritsa1gara).
<HI>NA1RA1YAN2A. One of the two R2s2is famous as Narana1ra1-
<>yan2as.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Dharma, son of Brahma1 was Na1ra1yan2a's
<>father. Dharma married ten daughters of Daks2a, and
<>four sons, i.e. Hari, Kr2s2n2a, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a were
<>born to him of them. Of the four, Nara and Na1ra1yan2a
<>were inseparable sannya1sins. In the holy Badarika1s4rama
<>on the slopes of the Hima1layas they did tapas to please
<>Brahma1 for a thousand years.
<NI>2) {%Na1ra1yan2a's tapas.%} The whole world was, so to say,
<>burnt by the intense tapas of Narana1ra1yan2as. Indra
<>was alarmed. Believing that their tapas was for the
<>attainment of Indrahood and fearing his own displace-
<>ment Indra went to Badarika1s4rama mounted on Aira1-
<>vata to break their tapas, and told them thus: “Oh
<>ascetics, who shine like the rising sun, I am pleased with
<>your tapas. You may choose any boon you like.”
<NI>The Narana1ra1yan2as did not even recognise the thunder-
<>like voice of Indra; nor did they answer him. This
<>increased Indra's alarm, and he decided to disturb
<>them with Ma1ya1, productive of fear, desire etc. and thus
<>break their tapas. Indra began threatening them
<>with cruel animals created by him like wild cat, leopard
<>tiger, lion, elephant etc. and also with aberrations
<>created in nature like storm, rain, wild fire etc. But,
<>none of the above affected or moved them in the least.
<>After all, why should they be moved? You would
<>threaten only those who are subject to desires, love of
<>comfort, any particular object in life or likes and dis-
<>likes. Since Narana1ra1yan2as had none of the above, Indra's
<>attempts to threaten them failed. Thus disappointed he
<>returned to Svargaloka and after thinking for a long
<>time he called Ka1madeva to him and spoke as follows:--
<>“You should go, along with Rati and the spring, to
<>Badarika1s4rama. Also take with you any number of
<>apsara1 women you want. You will find Narana1ra1yan2as
<>at the a1s4rama performing tapas and will weaken them
<>from their resolution by using your arrows (erotic shafts)
<>and tempt them into erotic life. I am also deputing
<>apsara1 women like Rambha1 to help you.”
<NI>Ka1madeva accordingly started for Badarika1s4rama
<>accompanied by all the apsara1 women. When they
<>reached the place spring season had set in there.
<NI>Varieties of beetles flew about from flower to flower
<>humming. Trees like the mango and Pala1s4a were thick
<>with flowers. Creepers (Comparable to young women)
<>entwined and embraced trees (lovers), the former
<>carrying pus2pas (flowers, in the case of young women,
<>coming of age). A fragrant breeze swept the whole
<>region. In this erotic background Ka1ma and Rati, with
<>their five arrows and accompanied by celestial women
<>came to the a1s4rama, and there they began singing and
<>dancing. The erotic flow enchanted the soul of Narana1-
<>ra1yan2as. Na1ra1yan2ars2i awoke from his tapas and
<>whispered something in the ears of Nara. By now
<>Ka1madeva had entered the presence of Narana1ra1yan2as
<>accompanied by the reputed beauties of Svarloka like
<>Menaka1, Rambha1, Tilottama1, Sukes4ini1, Manorama1,
<>Mahes4vari1, Pus2pagandha1, Pramadvara1, Ghr2ta1ci1,
<>Candraprabha1, Somaprabha1, Vidyunma1la1, Ambuja1ks2i1
<>and Ka1n5canama1la1. These beauties were accompanied
<>by 10080 of their beautiful attendants. Narana1ra1yan2as [Page533-a+ 64]
<>were wonder-struck to see this army of Ka1ma. All those
<>great beauties stood before Narana1ra1yan2as in salutation.
<>Some of them began to sing, others to dance and yet
<>others to take up the tunes. Na1rayan2ars2i could easily
<>divine the reason for the show. He thought to himself
<>thus--
<NI>“None but Devendra could have sent all these people
<>here, and his object must be to hinder our tapas. But I
<>shall prove to Indra that all these mean nothing to me.
<>Let Devendra understand that I can create more
<>beautiful ladies than these women of his here and that
<>I am not in the least attracted by any of them here.”
<NI>Thinking thus Na1ra1yan2a beat gently on his thigh and
<>immediately arose therefrom an exceptionally beautiful
<>woman. Since that woman, the most beautiful in all the
<>three worlds, was created from the U1ru (thigh) of
<>Na1ra1yan2a she came to be known as Urvas4i1. Others were
<>wonder-struck by this new creation. He created
<>some other beauties also, and an equal number of
<>other women to serve them. All of them stood before
<>him in humble salutation.
<NI>The celestial women almost fainted with fear. In re-
<>pentance they begged the munis pardon for their
<>mistake. The munis were kindly disposed towards them.
<>They told them that they (munis) cherished no
<>animosity towards them, but in fact were pleased with
<>them, and they further asked them (celestial women)
<>to choose their boons. The munis also asked them to
<>take Urvas4i1 to Devaloka as a present from them to Indra.
<>Let the Devas prosper.
<NI>Having heard Nara speak like this the celestial women
<>returned in great humility to Devaloka with Urvas4i1
<>and the other women. (Devi1 Bha1gavata, 4th Skandha).

<HI>NA1T2OT2INA1T2AKA. A kind of dramatic performance
<>in ancient Kerala. (See Tiraya1t2t2am).
<HI>NA1T2OT2IPPA1T2T2U. (FOLK-SONGS). Every literature
<>has a section known as na1t2ot2ippa1t2t2us (folk songs). In
<>Kerala (Malaya1lam) literature the period of folk songs
<>was a golden era. Worship of devata1s, honouring heroes,
<>entertainments, philosophy, science, caste-professions,
<>morals, ethics etc., generally formed the themes for
<>folk songs. There are a number of folk-songs in Malaya1-
<>lam called San3ghakkali, Ti1ya1t2t2u, Olappa1vakku1ttu,
<>Ezha1matu Kali, Ka1n2ippa1t2t2u, Na1t2t2uppa1t2t2u, Vat2t2ippa1t2t2n,
<>Pu1rakkalippa1t2t2u, At2accuturappa1t2t2u, (Pulluvarpa1t2t2u,
<>Nizhalku1ttuppa1t2t2u, Bhadraka1lippa1t2t2u, Tiraya1t2t2u etc. All
<>these songs are reflective of the spiritual thoughts and
<>ideas of the masses. Also, there is a special series of
<>folk-songs called Vat2akkanpa1t2t2us (songs of the north).
<NI>All the Vat2akkanpa1t2t2us are heroic songs. They are
<>folk-songs eulogising the heroic deeds and achievements
<>of certain heroes and heroines of exceptional courage
<>and prowess who flourished in olden days in north
<>Malabar. Though there are more than four hundred
<>such songs, only thirtyfive of them have been printed
<>and published yet. These songs, which call for no
<>special training or gifts for their singing or require any
<>special knowledge in music for their appreciation, take
<>their roots in the hearts of the common people. Almost
<>all these songs are connected with Kalaris (schools
<>where gymnastics are taught), At2avu (strategic feats of
<>the duel fight), Payattu (physical training) and An3kam
<>(fight). Descriptions of the challenges by heroes,
<>clashing of arms and the way how youngsters get out of
<>danger by their intelligence and prowess are really
<>exciting and exhilarating to read.
<NI>Most of the heroes in the Vat2akkanpa1t2t2us lived either
<>in Kat2attana1d2u or its suburbs. A good majority of the
<>songs sings the praises of two powerful families Puttu1ram
<>house and Taccolima1n2ikkattu, the former a Ti1ya and
<>the latter a Na1yar family. Taccolima1n2ikkattu house [Page534-b+ 65]
<>was at Meppa in Putuppan2am village near Vat2akara in
<>Kat2attana1d2u, and most of the songs relate to the great
<>hero Otenakkuruppu of this house. Otenakkuruppu
<>was born in 1584 A.D. and lived for thirtytwo years.
<>Therefore, the Vat2akkanpa1t2t2us may generally be placed
<>in the 16th and 17th centuries A.D. A1romalcekavar,
<>A1romalun2n2i, A1t2t2umman2amel Un2n2iya1rcca, Taccoli
<>Otenan, Taccoli Candu, Pa1la1t2t2u Komappan, Bamba1yi
<>A1likutty, Putuna1t2an Kelu and Kalpparampil Kan2n2an
<>are the chief characters in the pat2t2us. Especially the
<>song about Un2n2iya1rcca is thrilling. Brief notes about
<>the heroes and their families in the pa1t2t2us are given
<>below.
<NI>1) {%Puttu1ram Vi1t2u. (Puttu1ram House).%} A1romal Cekavar,
<>A1t2t2um3man2amel Un2n2iya1rcca and A1romalun2n2i were the
<>star heroes of the house. Un2n2iya1rcca was the sister of
<>A1romalcekavar and mother of A1romalun2n2i whose father
<>was Kan2n2appan. It may be understood from the song
<>‘puttiriyan3kam’ that A1romalcekavar was born to
<>Kan2n2appan when he was fortytwo years old. One or
<>two songs about A1romalcekavar are extant, one about
<>his playing a game of dice and the other about his
<>fighting the ‘puttiriyan3kam’.
<NI>As for the game of dice, A1romalcekavar went to his
<>uncle at Mikavil Mikaccerivi1t2t2il--an expert in the game
<>of dice--to study the art. There he spent a night with
<>his uncle's daughter Tumpola1rcca, who became preg-
<>nant by him. Though people ridiculed her at this
<>development A1romal cekavar took her as his wife when
<>she had delivered his child. A1romal Cekavar had also
<>another wife called Kun5cun2n2u1li of A1lattu1r house.
<NI>With regard to the puttiriyan3kam, Aromar as the Cekavar
<>(Sevakan, one who served) of Un2n2ikkona1r, once went to
<>fight with Arin3n3ot2ar. Candu, his father's nephew,
<>accompanied him as his assistant. Candu hated A1romar
<>from the day the latter stood in his way of marrying
<>Un2n2iya1rca.
<NI>Arin3n3ot2ar brought over to his side Candu, assistant of
<>A1romar. A1romar killed Arin3n3ot2ar in combat and on his
<>way home he slept lying on the lap of Candu weary
<>after the combat when the treacherous Candu thrust
<>heated handle of the lamp into a wound in the stomach
<>of A1romar, who managed to reach home only to die
<>there.
<NI>2) {%A1t2t2umman2amel Un2n2iya1rcca.%} Un2n2iya1rcca, overruling the
<>opposition of her father-in-law and mother-in-law, one
<>day went with her husband Kun5jura1man to witness
<>Ku1ttu in the Allimalar temple. When they came to
<>Et2avat2t2am market after passing Ta1nu1r market certain
<>ruffians confronted them. The coward that he was,
<>Kun5jura1man trembled before the ruffians, but Un2n2iya1-
<>rcca routed them with her skill in combat.
<NI>3) {%A1romalun2n2i.%} A1romalun2n2i, who as a youth heard from
<>his mother Un2n2iya1rcca the story about the treacherous
<>killing of his uncle, A1romal Cekavar, by Candu rushed
<>to Kolattuna1d2u and killed the latter in combat.
<NI>4) {%Taccoli Otenan.%} Otenan was a powerful Na1yar
<>(Kuruppu) born in Taccoli ma1n2ikkattu house. His
<>father was a na1yar chief well-known both as Putup-
<>pan2attuva1zunnor and Ci1nam3vi1t2t2il Tan3n3al. His mother
<>was Uppa1t2t2i, daughter of a woman called Teyi. He had
<>an elder brother called Komappan and a younger sister
<>called Un2icciruta (Un2iccira). Otenan's father begot a
<>son (Kan2t2a1cceri Ca1ppan) of Ma1kkam3, the maid-servant
<>of Uppa1t2t2i. Ca1ppan grew up to be a constant com- [Page535-a+ 64]
<>panion of Otenan. Komappan (Komakkuruppu)
<>brother of Otenan was a peace-loving, sedate person.
<>Otenan mastered all the tricks of Kalarippayattu at the
<>gymnasium of Matiloor Gurukkal. Otenan had also
<>mastered the use of the Urumi (a thin sword). He was
<>such a master in the use of the Urumi that he could, by
<>one sweep of it, graze the throat of a man without cut-
<>ting and shedding a drop of blood. He was an expert
<>in necromancy also. What could not be managed by
<>the physical strength of Otenan, Ca1ppan used to manage
<>with his intellectual powers.
<NI>Otenan was born on the slope of a hill at Meppa one mile
<>east of the present Vat2akara railway station. Relics and
<>remnants of Ma1n2ikkattu family are there yet to be seen.
<>Many songs have been composed about Otenan. One
<>of them is his going to receive presents of cloth on Onam
<>day from a stingy chief who, after the death of Otenan's
<>father, had become ‘Putuppan2attu Va1zhunnavar’.
<>Another song relates to his collecting taxes from Kotu-
<>mala Kun5n5ikkan2n2an on behalf of Ra1ja1 of Kot2t2ayam. Yet
<>another song is about his putting down the conceit and
<>pride of Kun3ki amma of Kekki house. And, another song
<>is about his killing Kaiteki Otenan Nambiya1r. His fight
<>with the ma1ppilas on behalf of the Ra1ja1 of Cirakkal
<>forms the theme of yet another song. Another interest-
<>ing song is about his making Kot2t2akkal Kun5n5a1li Marak-
<>ka1r, who was a bosom friend of his, though a philanderer
<>put on the attires of a female and thus teaching him a
<>good lesson in life. Another song describes the escape
<>of Otenan, who went to see the construction of the
<>Karimala fort, with the help of Ca1ppan. There are also
<>many other songs about Otenan.
<NI>The very marriage of Otenan is an interesting story.
<>Ma1teviamma of Ka1vilum ca1ttottu had a daughter named
<>Ci1ru. Ma1teviamma went to Ma1n2ikkattu house and
<>requested Otenan to marry her daughter Ci1ru. Otenan
<>refused to oblige her. But, Ci1ru grew up to be very
<>beautiful girl, and Otenan, who saw her in that state
<>felt a great passion for her. He sent Ca1ppan to her for
<>a pan (betel leaves for chewing) which she also refused.
<>At last Ca1ppan took Otenan disguised as a blind person
<>to Ci1ru's house. Ci1ru and Otenan got married without
<>the knowledge of Ci1ru's mother, who cursed them when
<>she knew about the marriage.
<NI>There is another story about Otenan and Karuttanit2am
<>(Kat2attana1t2u) Kun5n5ikkanni, the only daughter of the
<>Ra1ja1 of Kat2attana1t2u. A rowdy called Kelappan of
<>Ponna1puram for forcibly carried her off. The Ra1ja1,
<>who tried to bring back his daughter had to return
<>wounded. Otenan came to know that Ponna1puram fort
<>had once been given as dowry to his family and Kelap-
<>pan was in illegal and forcible occupation of it. Otenan
<>along with Ca1ppan went and captured the fort. He
<>released Kun5n5ikkanni from captivity and took Kelappan
<>captive. The Ra1ja1 of Kat2attana1t2u was very much
<>pleased with this exploit of Otenan and married Kun5n5ik-
<>kanni to him.
<NI>There is also a story about Otenan fighting with the
<>ma1ppilas of Cirakkal. The ma1ppilas did not honour the
<>Ra1ja1 of Cirakkal during one of his tours, and the Ra1ja1
<>asked Otenan to put down the haughtiness of the
<>ma1ppilas, and he did so. Kotamala Kun3kiamma, the
<>Ra1ja1 Pulina1d2u, Matilu1r Gurukkal and others are referred
<>to in this story. [Page535-b+ 65]
<>Katiru1r Gurukkal was a very powerful enemy of Otenan.
<>The Gurukkal one day kept his new gun leaning against
<>a jack fruit tree, and Otenan, in derision, commented
<>about it thus: “Who is it that has kept the spear made
<>of earth leaning against the tree on which usually spear
<>made of gold is kept so?” The Gurukkal, angry at the
<>insult challenged Otenan for a combat within three
<>months from Wednesday, the ninth of Kumbham. On the
<>appointed day Otenan went to Gurukkal's combat field
<>and killed him, Parintuku1l Emmenpaniykar and others.
<>On his way home after the victory, Otenan remembered
<>that he had forgotten his dagger on the platform of the
<>peepal tree, and paying no heed to the advice of his
<>friends he returned to the combat field and got killed
<>there.
<NI>5) {%Taccoli Candu.%} Candu was Otenan's nephew and was
<>reputed for his great prowess. Ma1lu of Ta1zhattu-
<>mat2ham was his wife. One day she went for worship
<>in the Omallur temple where Kan2d2ar Menon of Tulu-
<>na1t2an fort abducted her into his court. Candu was at
<>the time, twentytwo years old. On hearing about his
<>wife's mishap Candu, disguised as a Sannya1sin, entered
<>the fort and fought singlehanded against Menon and
<>his army of 400 soldiers.
<NI>6) {%Pa1lat2t2u Koman.%} Koman Na1yar, another nephew of
<>Otenan, the son of Kun3kiamma of Kappullipala1t2t2u,
<>became famous under the name Komappan. The family
<>feud between the Kuruppus of Ton2n2u1ra1mvi1tu and the
<>Na1yars of Pa1la1t2u was a long-standing affair. There
<>were seven Kuruppus during the days of Koman, and
<>they had two sisters named Un2n2icciruta and Un2n2iamma.
<>Koman felt a great passion towards Un2n2iamma, who
<>was bathing in the tank, and her brothers rushed to kill
<>Koman. But Koman outlived all obstacles created by
<>the seven brothers of Un2n2iamma and the tale-bearing
<>Un2icciruta because of the cleverness of the very intelli-
<>gent Un2n2iamma. Koman also got settled by Otenan
<>the fortytwo items of family quarrels and married
<>Un2n2iamma.
<NI>7) {%Bamba1yi A1likkut2t2i.%} In the song about A1dira1ja it is
<>said A1likkut2t2i, an expert in the science relating to ele-
<>phants, was invited for help when the seventh elephant
<>of the Ra1ja1 escaped back into the forest. A1likkut2t2i
<>hailed from Bombay. According to the song under refer-
<>ence A1likkut2t2i brought back the elephant from the
<>forest to the Ra1ja1, who, greatly pleased with him, gave
<>his daughter, Kun5n5ikkan2n2i, in marriage to him.
<NI>8) {%Putuna1t2an Kelu.%} Putuna1t2an Candu and Kelu were
<>brothers. Candu married a woman named Ma1tu.
<>One Vat2t2oli Menon became Ma1tu's paramour by brib-
<>ing her with a golden chain worth three thousand
<>pan2ams, and she got her husband killed by this param-
<>our. Candu had two dogs called Malli and Cokkan,
<>and one of them kept guard over Candu's dead body
<>while the other went and informed Kelu about Candu's
<>death. Kelu in great rage, rushed to the place, saw the
<>golden chain presented to Ma1tu by Menon and blinded
<>one of her eyes.
<NI>9) {%Kurumparampil Kan2n2an.%} This ti1ya youth had a very
<>chaste wife called A1rya1. One day when Kan2n2an was
<>away from home for tapping coconut palms for toddy
<>Putukolottu ra1ja1 saw A1rya1, and having felt a great pass-
<>ion for her he presented her one night four pieces of
<>silk and a gold ring. The next day A1rya1 dressed her
<>husband as a brahmin with the sacred thread on, and [Page536-a+ 64]
<>deputed him to return to the Ra1ja1's wife the presents
<>made by her husband to her (A1rya1). Kan2n2an succeeded
<>in his mission, but the revengeful Ra1ja1 ordered him to
<>be executed. A1rya1 went to the Ra1ja1 and after vari-
<>ous discussions with him returned home.
<HI>NAUBANDHANA. A peak of the Hima1layas. The peak
<>came to be known by this name on account of the
<>following cause. Once upon a time Hiran2yakas4ipu stole
<>the Vedas and with them hid in the bottom of the
<>ocean. Maha1vis2n2u incarnated himself as fish to restore
<>the Vedas. The world then was submerged in water
<>and the mahars2is escaped in a boat attached to the
<>horns of the Makara fish. On earth flood rose upto the
<>peaks of the Hima1layas. The Saptars2is attached their
<>boat to a peak of the mountain and that came to be
<>known as Naubandhana. (nau = boat; bandha = tie).
<>(Vana Parva, Chapter 187, Verse 50).
<HI>NAUKARN2I1. A female attendant of Subrahman2ya. (S4alya
<>Parva, Chapter 46, Verse 29).
<HI>NAVAGVA. The Navagvas are a group of the An3girases.
<>In R2gveda, mention is made about them in several
<>places.
<HI>NAVAKANYAKA1(S). An important item of Navara1tri-
<>pu1ja1 (A festival of 9 days, as observed by S4akti wor-
<>shippers) is the worship of virgins. The nine kinds of
<>virgins (from two to ten years in age) thus wor-
<>shipped are called Navakanyaka1s (nine virgins). (See
<>under2 Kuma1ri1pu1ja1).
<HI>NAVAMI1VARATA. (Fast on the ninth lunar day). This
<>is a special fast taken in the month of Tula1m (October-
<>November) with a view to obtain ‘Bhukti’ (enjoyment
<>or possession) and ‘Mukti’ (Beatitude). The important
<>rite of this worship is to take fast on the ninth night of
<>the bright lunar fortnight in the month of Tula1m and
<>worship goddess Gauri1. This navami1 is also called
<>Gauri1navami1. Another name of this navami1 is Pis2t2a1ka
<>navami1. This name is given because on that day
<>Pis2t2am (ground rice) is eaten and the goddess is wor-
<>shipped. In the bright lunar fortnight of the month of
<>Tula1m (A1s4vina), on the eighth night when the star is
<>Mu1lam and the Sun is in the zodiac of Kanya1 if there
<>is the touch of Navami1, it is called Agha1rdananavami1 or
<>Maha1navami1.
<NI>Worship could be conducted on the days mentioned,
<>by consecrating the goddess Durga1 in nine temples
<>or in one temple only. When the goddess is con-
<>secrated in nine temples they are meditated upon as
<>nine separate beings. In such cases Goddess Durga1
<>should be consecrated with eighteen hands and the rest
<>of the goddesses with sixteen hands. Of the eighteen
<>two should be holding Antimony and d2amaru (a small
<>drum shaped like an hourglass), and the remaining
<>sixteen hands should hold weapons that the other
<>goddesses hold. The nine goddesses to be worshipped
<>are Rudra1, Can2d2a1, Pracan2d2a1, Can2d2ogra1, Can2d2ana1yika1,
<>Can2d2avati1 and Can2d2aru1pa1 and in the middle of these
<>eight beings the great goddess Durga1 who is Ugracan2d2a1
<>and the slayer of Mahis2a1sura. Durga1 is addressed with
<>the spell of ten letters “Om, Durge Durgeks2in2i Sva1ha1.”
<>Adoration, offering to ancestors and exclamation in
<>sacrifice (Namaska1ra, Svadha1ka1ra and Vas2at2ka1ra)
<>should be denoted by six words and the An3gas (organs)
<>beginning with heart also should be imagined. This root-
<>spell should be repeated resting the organs such as heart [Page536-b+ 65]
<>etc. on the fingers. He who repeats this secret spell of
<>goddess, will never be troubled by enemies.
<NI>The goddess should be worshipped by meditating upon her
<>as carrying the weapons such as Kapa1la (skull), Khet2aka
<>(shield) Ghan2t2a1 (bell), Mirror, Tarjani1, bow, dhvaja
<>(flag), d2amaru (drum) and pa1s4a (rope) in the left hands
<>and S4akti (dart) Mudgara, trident, vajra, sword, spear,
<>conch, wheel and S4ala1ka (antimony) in the right hands.
<>These weapons also should specially be worshipped.
<NI>In the worship of the goddess, a cow (sacrificial animal)
<>should be beheaded with a sword repeating the spell
<>Ka1li1 Ka1li1 and the blood and flesh of that cow should be
<>offered as oblation to the goddess Pu1tana1 uttering the
<>spell, Ka1li1 Ka1li1 Vajres4vari1, lauhadan2d2a1yai namah2.”
<>Offering to Pu1tana1 should be made in the south west
<>corner of the shrine of the Devi1. In the same way
<>offerings of blood and flesh should be made to the
<>goddesses Pa1para1ks2asi1 in the North West corner, Caraki1
<>in the North East corner and Vida1rika1 in the South
<>East corner. The same form of offerings should be made
<>to the god Maha1kaus4ika in the south East corner. The
<>King should bathe in front of this god Maha1kaus4ika
<>and making an image of his enemy with rice flour,
<>should break it. Then give that rice flour as oblation
<>to the gods Skanda and Vis4a1kha and worship the female
<>ancestors such as Bra1hmi1 and such others in the night.
<>As ordained in the Vedas, the Devi1 should be bathed in
<>Pan5ca1mr2ta (milk, curds, butter, honey and water) and
<>then worship before her, uttering the spell “Jayanti1-
<>man3gala Ka1li1, Bhadraka1li1 Kapa1lini1, Durga1 S4iva1
<>Ks2ama1 Dha1tri1 Svadha1 Sva1ha1 Namostu te”. (Agni
<>Pura1n2a, Chapter 185).
<HI>NAVARATNAS I. (The nine precious Jewels). The nine
<>precious stones are pearl, ruby, Chrysoprasus, beryl,
<>diamond, coral, jacinth, emerald and sapphire.
<NI>Mukta1-ma1n2ikya-vaid2u1rya1-gomeda vajra-vidrumau /
<>Padmara1go maratakam3 ni1las4ceti yatha1kramam //
<HI>NAVARATNAS II. Legend says that there were nine
<>scholars who handled philosophy and arts, in the palace
<>of the emperor Vikrama1ditya. These nine scholars were
<>known by the name Navaratnas (the nine jewels). They
<>were Dhanvantari, Ks2apan2aka, Amarasim3ha, S4an3ku,
<>Veta1labhat2t2a, Ghat2akarpara, Ka1lida1sa, Vara1hamihira and
<>Vararuci.
<HI>NAVARA1TRI1. Navara1tripu1ja1 (nine nights' worship) is
<>done to goddess Durga1. Though this is observed through-
<>out the whole of India, it is more prominent in North
<>India than anywhere else. (To know the details regard-
<>ing the origin of this worship, see under Sudars4a, S4as4i-
<>kala1 and Vijayadas4ami1).
<NI>As ordained in the Vedas, the Nine nights' worship is
<>to be made in the seasons of spring and autumn. These
<>two seasons are called Ka1ladam3s2tra1s (the tusks of
<>seasons). Diseases and deaths occur in these seasons in
<>excess, and so it is ordained that this fast and worship
<>should be conducted in the months of Med2am (Mes2a)
<>and Tula1m.
<NI>Vya1sa has ordered that navara1tri worship should be
<>conducted as follows. The things necessary for the
<>worship and oblations should be collected on the new
<>moon day. Only clarified butter could be eaten on
<>that day. An open temple should be erected with
<>pillars and flag-posts in an open flat place which is pure.
<>It will be good if the shed has a circumference of sixteen
<>cubits. There should be sixteen pillars. The shed should [Page537-a+ 65]
<>be floored with the mixture of cowdung and white clay.
<>In the middle of the shed there must be a dais having
<>a height of one cubit and a circumference of four cubits.
<>This is the place for the seat. The shed and the dais
<>should be decorated.
<NI>The throne placed on the dais must be covered with a
<>white silk and Devi1 (goddess) should be consecrated on
<>it. A calm Brahmin should read the Vedas and at that
<>time the worship of the goddess should begin. This
<>worship will continue for nine days. Another ritual of
<>this ‘navara1tripu1ja1’ is the worship of virgins. (See
<>under Kuma1ri1pu1ja1)
<HI>NAVAVYU1HA1RCANA. This is a worship conducted to
<>prevent epidemics. In olden days Maha1vis2n2u advised
<>Na1rada on the form of this worship. The form of this
<>worship is given below:
<NI>In the centre of the circular lotus, consecrate Va1sudeva
<>with the first syllable of mantra (spell) ‘A’. To the
<>south of him consecrate and worship San3kars2an2a and
<>Pradyumna with the syllable ‘A1’; in the S.E. corner,
<>Aniruddha with the syllable ‘Ah2’; in the west, Na1ra1yan2a
<>with the syllable ‘Om’; Brahma1 in the N.W. corner
<>with the syllables ‘Tatsat’; Vis2n2u in the North with the
<>syllable ‘Hum’; Nr2sim3ha with the syllable ‘Ks2au’
<>and Vara1ha in the N.E. corner with the syllable
<>‘bhu1m’.
<NI>Consecrate Garud2a with spells having as first syllables
<>‘Kam’, ‘t2am’, “sam” and ‘s4am’ at the western entrance of
<>the lotus figure; Pu1rvavaktra, with syllables ‘Kham’
<>‘cham’, Vam’ and hum’ at the southern entrance of the lotus
<>figure; Gada1 (club), with the syllables ‘Kham’, ‘t2ham’
<>and ‘S4am’ at the Northern entrance; consecrate I1s4a
<>with the syllables ‘bam’, ‘n2am’, ‘mam’ and ‘Ks2am, in the
<>North East corner. Then consecrate S4ri1 with the
<>syllables ‘Dham’, ‘Dam’, ‘Bham’ and ‘Ham’ on the
<>southern side; Vanama1li1 with the syllables ‘Gam’, ‘D2am’
<>‘Vam’ and ‘S4am’, on the northern side; S4ri1vatsa with
<>the syllables ‘sam’, ‘ham’ and ‘lam’, to the west of
<>Vanama1li1; and Kaustubha, with the syllables, ‘cham’,
<>‘Tam’ and ‘yam’, to the west of S4ri1vatsa.
<NI>After having consecrated and worshipped persons as
<>mentioned above, in the order of the ten member-parts
<>of Maha1vis2n2u, Ananta should be consecrated below
<>the seat of the deity and in the order of the ten member
<>parts of Ananta, the four component parts called Mahe-
<>ndra and so on should be consecrated on the four direct-
<>ions such as east and so on, and consecrate in the same
<>way all the decorations, flags, canopy etc. Then the
<>three spheres of Va1yu (Air), Agni (fire) and Indu
<>(moon) should be consecrated with the first syllables
<>of the spells suited to each and meditating on them
<>and worshipping them, dip the body in the meditation.
<>Then imagine that the subtle form of the individual soul
<>is staying in the sky. Then meditate that the individual
<>soul is reborn by harmony with the universal soul after
<>having been dipped and washed in the snow-
<>white ambrosia emanating from the moon. After
<>that saying to yourself ‘I am Vis2n2u himself
<>reborn”, utter the twelve-syllabled mantra or spell.
<>Place heart, head, turban and weapon respectively on
<>chest, head, hindpart of the lock of hair and Netra (eye)
<>Place weapons in both hands. After this your body will
<>become divine. This placing of the individual soul
<>should be repeated in the same way with Deva (god)
<>and S4iva. When this worship of Vis2n2u is conducted in [Page537-b+ 65]
<>heart in imagination (without the aid of materials) it
<>is called ‘Anirma1lyapu1ja1, and when it is done with the
<>aid of lotus figure etc., it is called Sanirma1lya pu1ja1.
<NI>At this pu1ja1 (worship) the disciple should stand with
<>eyes tied. Then on whichever deity he places flower it
<>should be given that name. Place it on the left side
<>and burn gingelly, paddy and ghee in the sacrificial
<>fire. After performing hundred and eight burnings
<>perform another burning for the purification of the
<>body. To each of the member-parts of the Navavyu1ha
<>deities also burnt offering should be made, no less than
<>hundred times to each. Then put the entire thing in
<>fire as burnt offering. Then the disciples should take
<>fast, and the disciples should offer wealth etc. to the
<>teacher. (Agni Pura1n2a, Chapter 201).

<NI>1) {%Genealogy.%} Descended from Vis2n2u thus: Brahma1--
<>Mari1ci--Kas4yapa--Vivasva1n--Vaivasvata Manu--
<>Iks2va1ku--Nimi.
<NI>Among the sons of Iks2va1ku, Dan2d2a, Vikuks2i and Nimi
<>became famous.
<NI>2) {%Vasis2t2ha's curse.%} Emperor Nimi was very generous
<>with his gifts. He was interested in performing yajn5as.
<>The feeding hall that can be seen even today near the
<>a1s4rama of Gautama Mahars2i was built by emperor Nimi.
<>The emperor, a person of ra1jasic nature, decided to
<>conduct a Yajn5a which would take a long time to end
<>and which required much money for gifts; and he got
<>his father Iks2va1ku's permission for it. Arrangements
<>were made for the Yajn5a, and R2s2is like Bhr2gu, An3giras
<>Va1madeva, Pulastya, Pulaha and R2ci1ka who were
<>competent to perform yajn5a and great scholars in the
<>Vedas were invited for the Yajn5a. Lastly he met his
<>family preceptor Vasis2t2ha and told him thus: “Oh
<>preceptor! I have made all arrangements for a Yajn5a,
<>which it is my desire should last for five hundred years.
<>You would also come with me and see that the Yajn5a
<>is duly performed.”
<NI>Vasis2t2ha listened to Nimi's request with great atten-
<>tion. But, he had already been invited by Indra to
<>conduct a Yajn5a which would last for five hundred
<>years, and he would be able to oblige Nimi only after
<>that period of time. So Vasis2t2ha asked the emperor to
<>postpone his proposed yajn5a by five hundred years.
<>Nimi returned disappointed.
<NI>Nimi had no patience to wait for five hundred years.
<>So he started the yajn5a with Gautama as his preceptor.
<>After Indra's Yajn5a for 500 years was over, Vasis2t2ha
<>came to Nimi's Yajn5a hall. Nimi, at the time, was in
<>the inner apartment of his palace. Though his servants
<>went to him to tell him that his preceptor Vasis2t2ha
<>had come, they waited outside his chamber as he
<>was sleeping then. Within a few moments Vasis2t2ha
<>was ablaze with anger. He raised his hands and cursed
<>Nimi thus: “Oh! Nimi, you have insulted me, your
<>preceptor. You disobeyed my injunction and began the
<>Yajn5a. Therefore, let your body be parted from the
<>soul and fall on the ground.”
<NI>This curse of Vasis2t2ha alarmed the servants of Nimi so
<>much that they roused him from sleep and told him all
<>about the affair. Nimi hurried to Vasis2t2ha and pro-
<>strated at his feet. But, he did not shed his anger. This
<>made Nimi also angry. He also raised up his hands and
<>cursed Vasis2t2ha thus: “Oh muni! you who got angry
<>without reason are worse than a Can2d2a1la. Therefore
<>let your body also be parted from the soul and fall to
<>the ground.”
<NI>Vasis2t2ha got alarmed at the above curse. He ran up to
<>and submitted his grievance to Brahma1, who told him
<>thus:--“My son, your action was really fool-hardy.
<>Yet, I shall advise you a way out of your troubles. You
<>dissolve your-self in the effulgence of Mitra and Varun2a
<>and remain there permanently. After sometime you
<>will be able to be born without being present in the
<>womb of a woman. Then you will remember every-
<>thing about your previous birth will acquire sense of
<>righteousness and knowledge of the Vedas will become
<>respected by all and will be omniscient.
<NI>The soul of Vasis2t2ha parted from his body on account
<>of the curse of Nimi, saluted Brahma1, went to the
<>a1s4rama of Mitra1varun2as and got mixed with their [Page539-b+ 64]
<>effulgence. Meanwhile Urvas4i1 one day came to the
<>a1s4rama of Mitra1varun2as, who had seminal emission at
<>her sight. The semen fell into a pot. The pot duly
<>burst open and there emerged from it Agastya and
<>Vasis2t2ha.
<NI>Nimi returned to the Yajn5a hall and told the munis
<>about the curse on him of Vasis2t2ha. While the munis
<>were helplessly looking on, Nimi's body got separated
<>from the soul and fell down. The munis placed the
<>dead body in an uncovered coffin, kept it free from
<>putrefaction with the help of medicines and mantras
<>and continued with the Yajn5a. At the close of the
<>Yajn5a the Devas appeared and asked Nimi which did
<>he prefer to have, a human body or body of a Deva.
<>He preferred to have a Deva body, and accordingly
<>ascended to Svarga along with the Devas.
<NI>As Nimi had no sons to perform his obsequies the
<>munis began churning the corpse repeating mantras
<>and there arose from it an ideal person as glowing as
<>Nimi. As he was created by ‘mathana’ (churning) the
<>munis named him Mithi. Again, as he was created
<>from a dead body he came to be known as Janaka also.
<>Further, as he was born from the body from which the
<>soul had departed he was called Videha also. The
<>famous kingdom of Mithila1 on the banks of the Gan3ga1
<>was founded by this Janaka.
<NI>Janaka, the father of Si1ta1, was a King born in this
<>dynasty. To all the Kings born in this dynasty the
<>surname ‘Janaka’ came to be applied. This dynasty is
<>known as Janakavam3s4a and Videhavam3s4a after emperor

<>fied by mantras. Then the mahars2is saw dust rising
<>up everywhere and people told them that the poor
<>people, in the absence of king, had turned into thieves
<>and the dust was formed by the onrush of the thieves.
<>To remedy the problem thus created the mahars2is
<>churned the thigh of Vena, who had died childless, for
<>a son, and from the thigh was born a male child, dark in
<>colour, dwarfish and with a compressed face. Sadly he
<>asked the brahmins (mahars2is) what he should do. They
<>asked him to sit (nis2i1da) and hence he became Nis2a1da
<>(forest-dweller). His descendants settled down on mount
<>Vindhya and they by their sinful lives divested Vena
<>of his sins. Vena was absolved of his sins through the
<>Nis2a1das, and thus the Nis2a1das became responsible for
<>the ending of Vena's sins. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a, Part 1,

<>to them where Si1ta1 was and that on that day his wings
<>would automatically reappear and his legs would become

<>of lifting children came there with a lean child. She re-
<>placed Dharmis2t2ha1's child with the lean one and
<>returned with it to the S4a1lobharaparvata where her
<>blind husband asked her what she had brought for his
<>food. She told him about the changelling child with her
<>when he said as follows “Return the child at once to
<>where it was found. The child's father is a great man of
<>knowledge and wisdom and when he hears about your
<>action, he will curse us. So, return the child and bring the
<>child of some one else.” As soon as she heard these words
<>of her husband she rose up in the sky in great alarm.
<NI>Hearing the cries of the Ra1ks2asa child left at their
<>gates Dharmis2t2ha1 and her husband came out, and
<>the child which, in its colour and shape resembled their
<>child exactly, Kos4aka1ra said thus: “Oh! Dharmis2t2ha1!
<>this must be some ghost. Some one is lying here in the
<>same form as our child to hoodwink and cheat us.” [Page541-a+ 65]
<>Saying so he tied the child to the ground by chanting
<>mantras with darbha grass in his hands.
<NI>At the same time S4u1rpa1ks2i1 came there in invisible form.
<>She threw Dharmis2t2ha1's child from a distance into the
<>courtyard. Kos4aka1ra took his child. But all the attempts
<>of the Ra1ks2asi1 to lift her child from the ground failed.
<>The grief-stricken Ra1ks2asi1 reported the matter to her
<>husband.
<NI>As soon as S4u1rpa1ks2i1 left the place the magnanimous
<>Kos4aka1ra handed over the Ra1ks2asa child to his wife.
<>He brought up his own child by feeding it on cow's milk,
<>curd, juice of sugar-cane etc. Both the children grew
<>up to seven years of age. The Ra1ks2asa boy was named
<>Diva1kara and the other child Nis4a1kara. Both the child-
<>ren were invested with the sacred thread in due course
<>of time. Diva1kara learned the Vedas, but Nis4a1kara did
<>not, and he was despised by all. His father pushed
<>him into a neglected well and covered its mouth with
<>stone.
<NI>Nis4a1kara lived in the well for many years. The fruits
<>of a cluster of plants in the well served as his food. Some
<>ten years afterwards when Nis4a1kara's mother found the
<>mouth of the well closed with a big stone she asked
<>as to who did so, and from the well came the answer,
<>“Mother, it was father who covered this well with that
<>stone.” Alarmed at this the mother asked who was with-
<>in the well, and she was answered, “Your son, Nis4a1kara.”
<>Then she argued that her son was named Diva1kara and
<>that she had no son called Nis4a1kara. But, Nis4a1kara
<>told her about his past life and what had happened
<>to him during the present life, upon which the mother
<>rolled away the stone and Nis4a1kara came out of the
<>well and prostrated before his mother. He then went
<>home with his mother. Questioned as to how and why
<>these things happened by Kos4aka1ra his son Nis4a1kara
<>described his previous life as follows:--
<NI>Father, you would please hear about the reason why I
<>became dumb and idiotic. In my previous life I was
<>born in a noble family, my father being called Vr2s2a1kapi
<>and mother Ma1la1. My father taught me all the S4a1stras
<>and the Vedas. I became conceited over my unique learn-
<>ing and erudition and began doing evil acts. Conceit
<>led to avarice, and I lost all my scholarship. I became
<>indiscreet. Having thus become a fool, I began com-
<>mitting sins. I had to hang myself to death on account
<>of my association with others' women and stealing
<>others’ money. I, therefore, fell into the Raurava hell.
<>After a thousand years some sin remained attached to
<>me as a result of which I was born as a tiger, and a
<>King trapped and took me to his city When
<>I was caged S4a1stras about Dharma, Artha and
<>Ka1ma came up in my mind.
<NI>One day the King went out wearing only one piece of
<>cloth and with a club in his hands. Then his wife Ajita1,
<>a unique beauty came to me, and because of my taste
<>in my previous life sexual desire arose in my heart. I
<>told her about my feelings. She also felt like me. So,
<>she unchained me and I approached her in great passion
<>and seeing me thus the King's servants tied me to a
<>peepal tree and thrashed me to death.
<NI>My soul again returned to hell. After a thousand years
<>I was born as a white ass in the house of a brahmin
<>named Agnives4ya, who had many wives. Then all
<>knowledge and wisdom were reflected in my mind. My
<>duty was to carry the brahmin women on my back. One [Page541-b+ 65]
<>day the brahmin's wife Vimati of Navara1s2t2ra started
<>for her father's home mounted on my back. Half-way
<>home she dismounted and went to a stream to bathe.
<>The exquisite beauty of that lady with wet clothes up-
<>set me, and I ran up to her on the stream, pushed her
<>into the water and myself fell upon her. Then a person
<>came and tried to tie me down. I escaped from his
<>grips and ran southwards. While thus running the
<>saddle slipped into my mouth and I fell down. And,
<>within six days I died thinking about her. Thus I fell
<>again into hell. My next birth was as a parrot. A
<>hunter caged me in the forest and he sold me to a
<>Vais4ya merchant, who put me up in the women's
<>quarters. The young women fed me on rice and fruits.
<>One day the wife of the Vais4ya merchant hugged me
<>to her breast and petted me. Her touch kindled in me
<>sexual feelings and I embraced her with my wings. In
<>my hurry about the affair I slipped down and got
<>crushed between the doors. Thus I fell again into hell.
<NI>Afterwards I was born as an ox in a camp of a
<>Can2d2a1la. One day he yoked me to his cart and
<>started for the forest in it with his wife. On the way
<>she sang a song, and mentally excited by it I looked
<>back. At once I slipped my feet, fell down and died.
<>Again I returned to hell.
<NI>After another one hundred years I was born as your
<>(Kos4aka1rad) son in this house. All facts about my
<>previous lives linger in my memory and now I am free
<>from evils and am a virtuous person. I am going to the
<>forest for tapas. Let the good boy, Diva1kara live here
<>as house-holder. Nis4a1kara thus did tapas for many
<>years and attained Vaikun2t2ha (Va1mana Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 91).
<NI>There is no definite evidence in the Pura1n2as to estab-
<>lish that the Nis4a1kara, the protector of Sampa1ti and
<>the Nis4a1kara mentioned above were the same person.

<HI>NIS2T2HU1RIKA. A na1ga born in the Kas4yapa dynasty.
<>(Udyoga Parva, Chapter 106, Verse 12).
<HI>NIS4UMBHA I. An asura. Two of the sons of Kas4yapa
<>Praja1pati by his wife. Diti became notorious fellows
<>called S4umbha and Nis4umbha. They were born and
<>brought up in Pa1ta1la. But as young men thay came to
<>the earth and began rigorous tapas taking neither food
<>nor drink. After ten thousand years Brahma1 appeared
<>and asked them to choose their boons. They requested
<>for eternity, deathlessness. But, Brahma1 refused to
<>grant that boon. Then they thought of another boon,
<>which would in effect be as goodas the first one; they
<>wanted death to come, but to come in a manner im-
<>possible to happen. So, they requested Brahma1 as
<>follows: “We shall not meet with death at the hands
<>of males among Devas, human beings as also by birds,
<>animals etc. In short we should be killed only by
<>women; we fear them not.”
<NI>Brahma1 granted them such a boon and they returned
<>to Pa1ta1la. They lost their head over the boon and
<>appointed S4ukra as their preceptor. S4ukra was so
<>pleased at this that he made S4umbha sit on a golden
<>throne and crowned him King of Daityas. Following
<>this, lesser Kings began coming to salute the great
<>King and pay tributes. Great daityas like the Can2d2a-
<>mun2d2as, Dhu1mralocana, Raktabi1ja etc., became attend-
<>ants of S4umbha and Nis4umbha.
<NI>After having established the power of the daityas thus
<>S4umbha--Nis4um bhas gradually turned their atten-
<>tion towards extending the boundaries of their kingdom.
<>The whole earth they subjugated. Then Nis4umbha
<>with a large army marched to Devaloka to conquer
<>Indra. A Deva1sura war started. In the fight all the
<>Dikpa1lakas were on one side and Nis4umbha alone on
<>the other side; the latter side was slightly defeated.
<>Smitten by Indra's Vajra1yudha Nis4umbha fainted; his
<>army also was broken.
<NI>As soon as news about the defeat of his brother was
<>reported to him, S4umbha, with the remaining Da1navas
<>hurried to Devaloka. In the battle that ensued the
<>Devas were routed. S4umbha assumed Indra-hood by
<>force and the standard (flag) of the daityas was hoisted
<>on the flag-staff of Sudharma1, the palace of Indra.
<>S4umbha captured Ka1madhenu, Aira1vata, Uccais4s4ravas
<>etc. The Nandana garden and the shades of the [Page542-b+ 64]
<>Kalpaka tree were turned into resting places of the
<>daityas. Fragrant flowers of the Kalpa tree adorned the
<>hairs of daitya women. S4umbha drove away Kubera
<>and took over Alaka1puri1 also from him. As Yama ran
<>away from the kingdom, Ka1lapuri1 also came under
<>S4umbha. All the Dikpa1lakas took refuge in forests and
<>caves. Thousand years rolled by thus. By then the
<>Devas worshipped Maha1devi1, who appeared before
<>them. Kaus4iki1 devi1, born from the body of Maha1devi1
<>stood before the Devas. As Kaus4iki1 was dark in colour
<>she came to be known as Ka1lika1 also. Maha1devi1,
<>along with Ka1lika1 started for the capital of S4umbha-
<>Nis4umbhas. At the capital they ascended a mountain
<>and sat on two rocks. Maha1devi1 sang such a melodious
<>song that birds and animals lost themselves in its
<>sweetness and stood motionless.
<NI>The Can2d2amun2d2as, who were at the time passing that
<>way were also attracted by the music. Having under-
<>stood what it all meant they hurried upto S4umbha1sura
<>and gave him a description of the supreme beauty of
<>Maha1devi1 and Ka1lika1. The description kindled great
<>interest in S4umbha and Nis4umbha about the devi1s and
<>they deputed their minister Sugri1va to bring the devi1s
<>over to them. Having heard Sugri1va's mission Maha1-
<>devi1 told him as follows:--“We do not have any
<>objection to becoming the wives of your masters But,
<>in the matter of my marriage there is a special problem.
<>While playing with my friends as a child I had
<>accidentally taken a vow. I was at that age a bit proud
<>about my capabilities and strength, and the vow I took
<>was that I would marry only someone who was stronger
<>than I am. My friends called me a ‘fool’ and ridiculed
<>me about the vow. That only hardened my stubborn-
<>ness and I stand by my vow even now. Therefore,
<>please tell S4umbha first to defeat me in fighting.”
<NI>When Sugri1va carried this information to S4umbha, and
<>Nis4umbha, they felt amused that a woman challenged
<>them to fight. But, they had no alternative but to
<>fight. So they deputed the mighty daitya Dhu1mra1ks2a
<>with an army to fight Devi1, and there ensued a fierce
<>fighting between Devi1 and Ka1lika1 on one side and the
<>big daitya army on the other side. The whole army and
<>finally Dhu1mra1ks2a too was killed.
<NI>Devi1 then retired from the battlefield to a place nearby
<>and blew the conch. S4umbha-Nis4umbhas heard the
<>sound from it, and the next moment a messenger
<>came and told them about the fate of the army and of
<>Dhu1mra1ks2a. They then sent a much greater army
<>under Can2d2amun2d2as against Devi1. But Ka1lika1 devour-
<>ed them all. Raktabi1ja, who next encountered Devi1
<>with a great force, also became food for Ka1lika1. Then
<>S4umbha-Nis4umbhas entered the battlefield and they too
<>were killed. Devas thus victorious regained Svarga.
<>(Devi1 Bha1gavata, 5th Skandha).
<HI>NIS4UMBHA II. The Maha1bha1rata mentions another
<>Nis4umbha, a dependant of Naraka1sura. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a

<HI>NIVA1TAKAVACA(S). A sect of Daityas.
<NI>1) {%Birth.%} Daityas were the off-springs of Kas4yapapra-
<>ja1pati by Diti. Two sons called Hiran2ya1ks2a and Hiran2-
<>yakas4ipu and a daughter called Sim3hika1 were born to
<>the Praja1pati of Diti. Sim3hika1 was married by Vipracitti
<>and to them were born Ra1hu and others who became
<>famous as the Saim3hikeyas. Hiran2yakas4ipu had four
<>famous sons called Anuhla1da, Hla1da, Prahla1da (the
<>great devotee of Vis2n2u) and Sam3hla1da. (Some texts
<>refer to them as Anuhra1da, Hra1da, Prahra1da and Sam3-
<>hra1da). Hla1da's son was called Hra1da, Sam3hla1da's sons
<>were called A1yus2ma1n, S4ibi and Ba1s2kala, and Prahla1da's
<>son was called Virocana. Maha1bali was Virocana's son
<>and Ba1n2a was the eldest of the hundred sons of Maha1-

<>which routed the Devas many a time, was formed by
<>the Niva1takavacas and Ka1lakeyas. (Agni Pura1n2a,
<>Chapter 19).
<NI>2) {%Fight against Ra1van2a.%} After securing boons from
<>Brahma1 Niva1takavacas lived in the city of Man2imati1 and
<>they were a terror to the world. Ra1van2a longed once to
<>defeat them and so besieged their city with his army.
<>The two sides fought fiercely for hundreds of years. At
<>last Brahma1 intervened and conciliated them. From
<>that day onwards the Niva1takavacas became friends of
<>Ra1van2a. (Uttara Ra1ma1yan2a).
<NI>3) {%Annihilation.%} The Niva1takavacas in company with
<>the Ka1lakeyas attacked Devaloka. Indra, who could
<>not withstand the attack, sent his charioteer Ma1tali to
<>Arjuna and brought him down. Most of the Niva1ta-

<HI>NIYATI. A daughter called Laks2mi1 and two sons called
<>Dha1ta1 and Vidha1ta1 were born to mahars2i Bhr2gu of his
<>wife Khya1ti. Dhata1 and Vidha1ta1 married A1yati and
<>Niyati, daughters of Meru. A son named Pra1n2a was
<>born to Vidha1ta1, and this Pra1n2a became father of Mr2k-
<>an2d2u and grandfather of Ma1rkan2d2eya. (Vis2n2u Pura1n2a,
<>Part 1, Chapter 10).

<NI>Nr2ga was the younger brother of Iks2va1ku. From Nr2ga
<>was born Sumati, from him the king called Jyotis, from
<>Jyotis Vasu and from Vasu Prati1ka.
<NI>2) {%Nr2ga became chameleon.%} Nr2ga was an extremely
<>righteous and generous King. Once, at Pus2kara he
<>gifted away thousands of cows to brahmins. There was
<>a brahmin called Parvata living near Pus2kara. He too
<>was given a cow and it was after that the brahmin
<>named Ana1rata came. By then there remained no cow
<>to be gifted. Ana1rata came after Parvata had gone
<>into the forest after leaving the cow at the pond (Pus2k-
<>ara). Nr2ga had forgotten the fact that the cow had
<>already been gifted away to Parvata and finding it there
<>owner-less he gave it to Ana1rata, who went away with
<>the cow very much pleased. The King and his minis-
<>ters also returned to the palace.
<NI>A very short time afterwards Parvata returned to the
<>pond and felt very sorry to miss his cow. He searched
<>for it here and there and at last found it at Ana1rata's
<>house. Quarrel ensued between the two, Parvata
<>alleging that Ana1rata had stolen his cow while the
<>latter contended that it had been given to him by the
<>King. Now, it was decided that the question should
<>be submitted for arbitration to the King, and the
<>contending parties went to the capital to see the King.
<>At the palace they asked the gate-keepers to tell the
<>King about their arrival. But, they did not tell the
<>King, nor did he come.
<NI>Angered at this the brahmins cursed that Nr2ga be
<>converted into a chameleon and live as such for a
<>thousand years. The King heard about the curse and
<>ran up to the brahmins and requested for absolution
<>from it. The brahmins then said that after one thou-
<>sand years Maha1vis2n2u would incarnate as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>and that at his touch Nr2ga, the chameleon would
<>resume his former form as King. According to this
<>curse Nr2ga was born as a chameleon in a neglected
<>well at Dva1raka1. One day Sa1mba and others who
<>happened to go near the well tried their best to take
<>the chameleon out of it, to no purpose. At last Kr2s2n2a
<>with his attendants came and took it out of the well.
<>At Kr2s2n2a's touch it resumed its form as King Nr2ga,
<>and related the story of his curse to the onlookers,
<>who stood there wondering.

<HI>PADMA1VATI1 VI. Wife of a Vais4ya named Pran2idhi.
<>Once Pran2idhi went to a neighbouring village for trade.
<>Padma1vati1 and her companions were one day bathing

<>Attracted by her dazzling beauty he remained there
<>talking to her. The S4u1dra named Dharmadhvaja was
<>greatly enamoured of her and the companions of
<>Padma1vati1, noticing that, just to make fun of him said
<>“If you abandon your life at the point where the rivers
<>Gan3ga1 and Yamuna1 meet you can attain Padma1vati1.”
<>Without any hesitation, thinking that what they said
<>was true, he went and ended his life at the place suggest-
<>ed. Immediately he became a replica of Pran2idhi and
<>stood before Padma1vati1. The real Pran2idhi also came
<>there then. Padma1vati1 was in a fix to choose the real
<>husband. Maha1vis2n2u appeared before them then and
<>asked Pa1dma1vati1 to accept both of them as her husbands
<>Padma1vati1 pleaded it was forbidden for women of her
<>community to accept more than one husband and then

<>He was the son of a person named Vasu and attended
<>the Ra1jasu1ya of Yudhis2t2hira. (S4loka 35, Chapter 33,
<>Sabha1 Parva). Paila was also one among those who
<>visited Bhi1s2ma while he was lying on his bed of arrows.
<>(S4loka 6, Chapter 17, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PAILAGARGA An ancient sage. Amba1, daughter of the
<>King of Ka1s4i1, once practised austerities in the a1s4rama
<>of this sage. (See under Amba1).
<HI>PAIS4A1CA. A kind of marriage. (See under Viva1ha).
<HI>PAIT2HAKA. An asura. This asura was killed by S4ri1

<>which lasted for several days took place in which the
<>asura army was destroyed and Pa1ka killed. Indra got
<>thenceforth the name Pa1kas4a1sana. (Chapter 70, Va1yu
<>Pura1n2a).
<HI>PAKAL. Malaya1lam word meaning Day. A story about
<>the origin of day, night, dawn and dusk is contained in
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a. At the time of the great Deluge every-
<>thing from gods down to the rocks lay submerged in
<>Parabrahman (Supreme Being). Brahma1 sat in medi-
<>tation to initiate what he termed as Jagatsr2s2t2i, the
<>four species of living beings like the devas, asuras, pitr2s
<>and men. When the meditation proceeded, the Tamogun2a
<>in Brahma1 became prominent and so first and foremost
<>of all, the asuras were born from his waist. Then
<>Brahma1 discarded his Tamogun2a and the manifestation
<>of the discarded Tamogun2a became Night. Brahma1 sat
<>again in meditation and from his face sprang out the
<>devas, who were embodiments of sattvagun2a. Brahma1
<>discarded the sattvagun2a and it then became Day. That is
<>why asuras are powerful at night and devas by day.
<>Then another manifestation with sattvagun2a predominat-
<>ing sprang out from Brahma1 and it was called Pitr2s.
<>Brahma1 discarded that also and it became Dusk.
<>Brahma1 sat again in meditation and then were born
<>men who were a manifestation of Rajogun2a. Brahma1
<>discarded that also and it then became Dawn. That is
<>why men are strong at dawn and the pitr2s strong at
<>dusk. It is because of these that it is said that day,
<>night, dawn and dusk are bodies of Brahma1. All the
<>above four are an asylum of the three gun2as.
<NI>Night is called Us2a1 and day, Vyus2t2i. Sandhya1 (dusk)
<>is the time between Us2a1 and Vyus2t2i. When the fierce
<>and terrible Sandhya1 commences, a set of ferocious
<>demons called Mandehas desire to eat the Sun. A fight
<>ensues then between the Sun and the demons and by a
<>curse of Praja1pati the demons die daily though their
<>bodies never perish. At that time the best of Brahmins
<>with the sound of ‘OM’ vibrating recite the ga1yatri1 and
<>throw water upwards. That water transforms itself into
<>Vajra1yudha and burns to death the wicked demons.
<>The first oblation to the sacrificial fire is performed
<>reciting the mantra which begins with “Su1ryojyotih2”.
<>‘OM’ is but Bhagava1n Vis2n2u, lord of the Vedas with
<>the lustre of R2k, Yajus and Sa1ma. The very utterance of
<>the word ‘OM’ therefore, destroys the demons
<>Mandehas. (Chapter 8, Am3s4a 2, Chapter 5, Am3s4a 1,
<>Vis2n2u Pura1n2a).
<HI>PA1KHAN2D2A. An ancient place of habitation in Daks2in2a
<>Bha1rata. Sahadeva one of the Pa1n2d2avas sent his messen-
<>gers and subdued the country. (S4loka 70, Chapter 31
<>Sabha1 Parva). [Page546-a+ 65]
<HI>PA1KKANA1R. Vararuci, the celebrated astronomer, got
<>of a Can2d2a1li1 wife twelve sons. They were called
<>“Paracci pet2t2a panti1rkulam (The twelve sons born of
<>a Can2d2a1li1).
<NI>They were
<NI>1. Agnihotri1. 2. Rajakan 3. Uliyanu1r Taccan. 4. Vallon
<>5. Va1yilla1kkunnilappan. 6. Ka1rakkalma1ta1. 7. Vat2utala
<>Na1yar. 8. Uppukut2t2an. 9. Pa1n2ana1r. 10. Na1ra1yan2a-
<>bhra1ntan 11. Akavu1r Ca1ttan 12. Pa1kkana1r.
<NI>Pa1kkana1r's wife was a very chaste woman devoted to
<>her husband. There are two stories demonstrating the
<>devotion she showed to her husband.
<NI>(i) It was usual for all the sons of Vararuci excepting
<>Va1yilla1kkunnilappan to assemble at the house of Agni-
<>hotri1 for the S4ra1ddha of their father annually once.
<>Once after the S4ra1ddha, all of them sat together for
<>their meals and the antarjanam (wife) of Agnihotri1
<>refused to serve an assembly consisting of Pa1kkana1r, a
<>Can2d2a1la. When Agnihotri1 compelled her to do it she
<>came to the place hiding her face with an umbrella.
<>Pa1kkana1r enquired about the purpose of the umbrella
<>and Agnihotri1 replied that it was the duty of chaste
<>and devoted wives to hide their faces from other men.
<>Then Pa1kkana1r argued that still the brahmin wives who
<>hid their faces were lacking in devotion and chastity
<>and the Can2d2a1la women were the only class of women
<>who were chaste and devoted to their husbands. Every-
<>body present there joined sides with Agnihotri1 and
<>opposed the argument of Pa1kkana1r. To demonstrate
<>the devotion of Can2d2a1li1 wives Pa1kkana1r took Agnihotri1
<>to his house. On reaching there Pakkana1r called his
<>wife and asked “How much paddy do you have here?”
<>“Five measures”, she replied. “Pound half of it and
<>bring it to me”, Pa1kkana1r instructed. The dutiful wife
<>pounded the paddy, cooked the rice and brought it to
<>Pa1kkana1r. Pa1kkana1r asked her to throw the rice into
<>the drain. She did it without the least hesitation. Pa1kka
<>na1r then asked his wife to pound the remaining paddy
<>and bring the rice cooked as before. She did so and when
<>she brought it before Pa1kkana1r he asked her to throw
<>that also away into the drain. She instantly obeyed.
<>That day both of them went without meals. They were
<>so poor.
<NI>The next day Pa1kkana1r along with Agnihotri1 went to
<>the illam (house) of Agnihotri1. Pa1kkana1r then asked
<>Agnihotri1 to make his wife do exactly like what
<>Pa1kkana1r's wife was made to do. Agnihotri1 immediate-
<>ly called his wife and asked her to take two and a half
<>measures of paddy, pound it, cook it and bring it to
<>him. “There is rice here ready in stock and so why
<>should we pound paddy now?” Agnihotri1's wife
<>questioned. But Agnihotri1 insisted and so surrender-
<>ing to the compulsion she did as she was instructed.
<>When she brought the rice before him cooked, Agnihotri1
<>asked her to throw it away into the drain. She hesitated
<>first but when Agnihotri1 insisted she did so very
<>reluctantly. Then Agnihotri1 asked her to take another
<>two and a half measures of paddy, pound it and bring
<>the cooked rice once again. The antarjanam (wife)
<>flew into fury and showered on her husband a heap of
<>abuses. She went and hid inside and despite repeated
<>requests from Agnihotri1 she never showed her face out
<>again. Agnihotri1 admitted defeat and accepted
<>Pa1kkana1r's view that a Can2d2a1li1 woman was more chaste
<>than a brahmin woman. [Page546-b+ 64]
<NI>(2) Once Agnihotri1 came to the hut of Pa1kkana1r.
<>Pa1kkana1r called his wife to bring a ‘palaka’ (a wooden
<>plank used for sitting) for Agnihotri1 to sit on. She was
<>at that time drawing water from a well and the bucket
<>was midway in the well with water. The instant she
<>heard her husband call her she left the grip on the rope
<>and rushed to the side of her husband. She did what
<>was asked of her to do and then returned to the well.
<>Pa1kkana1r followed her taking Agnihotri1 along with
<>him. When they reached the well Agnihotri1 was dumb-
<>founded. The bucket with water was staying in mid-air
<>in the well exactly at the position at which Pa1kkana1r's
<>wife had left it. The power of the chastity of the
<>woman. (See under Vararuci).
<HI>PAKS2A. See under Ka1lama1na.
<HI>PAKS2A1LIKA1. A female follower of Subrahman2ya.
<HI>PAKS2IVAM3S4A. The Pura1n2ic version of the origin of
<>birds is given below:
<NI>Descending in order from Vis2n2u came Brahma1--Mari1ci
<>-Kas4yapapraja1pati. The latter got of his wife Ta1mra1
<>(daughter of Daks2a) five daughters named Kraun5ci1,
<>Bha1si1, S4yeni1, Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 and S4uki1. From Kraun5ci1 were
<>born the Ulu1kas, Bha1si1 gave birth to Bha1sas, S4yeni1 to
<>vultures and Dhr2tara1s2t2ri1 to swans and geese. From
<>these originated the entire bird family of the world.
<>(Chapter 4, Aran2ya Ka1n2d2a, Va1lmi1ki Ra1ma1yan2a).
<HI>PAKTHA. A King of Vedic times who was a protege

<HI>PALA1S4AVANA. A sacred forest. Once the sage Jama-
<>dagni performed a sacrifice in this forest. On that occa-

<HI>PAN5CABHU1TA. Pr2thvi1 (earth), Ap (water), Tejas
<>(fire), Va1yu (air) and A1ka1s4a (ether) are the Pan5ca-
<>bhu1tas (five elements). The whole visible world is com-
<>posed of one or more of these five elements. This is
<>called the Pa1n5cabhautikasiddha1nta (doctrine of five ele-
<>ments). Besides these five dravyas (elementary subs-
<>tance), people in Bha1rata have reckoned Time, space,
<>soul and mind also as Pada1rthas or categories. Dravya,
<>one of the seven categories according to Nya1ya Vais4es2ika-
<>su1tras, has nine svabha1vas (inherent properties). The
<>seven Pada1rthas of Vais4es2ika are Dravya, Gun2a, Karman
<>Sa1ma1nya, Vis4es2a, Samava1ya and Abha1va.

<NI>The word ‘Pada1rtha’ has got a very wide meaning. The
<>word ‘matter’ in English cannot indicate the full signi-
<>ficance of the word Pada1rtha. Kan2a1da in his Vais4es2ika
<>su1tras has given the name ‘Artha’ combining in it the
<>three svabha1vas, Dravya, Gun2a and Karman. Of the
<>above seven pada1rthas Pras4astapa1da, the famous logic-
<>ian, has included only the first six in his book
<>‘Pada1rthadharma Sam3graha’. The Vais4es2ikas of a later
<>period included ‘abha1va’ also and raised the number
<>of arthas to seven. Gautama, the Nya1yasu1traka1ra and
<>Va1tsya1yana, the Nya1yabha1s2yaka1ra, and all their followers
<>accepted the number of arthas as seven.
<NI>All that can be perceived by the senses are includ-
<>ed in the seven Pada1rthas according to the sys-
<>tems of Nya1ya and Vais4es2ika. Excepting abha1va all the
<>other six are bha1vas. Kan2a1da has dealt with ‘abha1va’
<>but has not treated it as a category. Pras4astapa1da has not
<>mentioned about ‘abha1va’ at all. Gautama deals with six-
<>teen Pada1rthas. The Mi1ma1m3sakas take into account only
<>five Pada1rthas and the Sa1n3khyas count only two
<>Pada1rthas viz., Prakr2ti and Purus2a. Advaitava1dins re-
<>ckon only two Pada1rthas and to them they are Cit and
<>Jad2a (A1tma1 and Ana1tman). Vis4is2t2a1dvaitins add god
<>also to the above and make the number of Pada1rthas
<>three. [Page547-b+ 52]
<>According to Nya1ya Vais4es2ikasu1tras there are seven
<>Pada1rthas and they comprise nine kinds of Dravyas which
<>are the Pan5cabhu1tas (five elements), Ka1la (time), Dik
<>(space), A1tma1 (soul), and Manas (mind). They are
<>described below:
<NI>1) {%Pr2thvi1. (earth).%} The characteristic of this pada1rtha
<>is smell. Pr2thvi1 is of two kinds, Nitya (eternal) and
<>Anitya (perishable). Nitya is in the form of atom
<>(parama1n2u) and anitya in the form of Ka1rya. They
<>are classified into body, sense organs and objects.
<NI>2) {%Jala (water).%} Jala has a cold touch. It is of two
<>kinds Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of parama1n2u
<>(atom); Anitya in the form of Ka1rya.
<NI>3) {%Agni (fire).%} It generates heat. It is of two kinds,
<>Nitya and Anitya. Nitya is in the form of parama1n2u
<>and Anitya, in the form of Ka1rya. There are four kinds
<>of Agnis: Fire of the earth, fire of the sky, fire of the
<>stomach (digestive power) and the fire commonly used.
<NI>4) {%Va1yu (air).%} It is without form but with the sense
<>of touch. It is also of two kinds. Nitya in the form of
<>parama1n2u and Anitya in the form of Ka1rya.
<NI>5) {%A1ka1s4a (ether).%} This is the carrier of sound. It is
<>single and eternal.
<NI>6) {%Ka1la (time).%} It is general cause for all actions em-
<>bracing the elements. It is also single and eternal.
<NI>7) {%Dik.%} Places like north, south, east and west which
<>are eternal.
<NI>8) {%A1tma1 (soul).%} It is related to knowledge and is of
<>two kinds, Ji1va1tma1 and Parama1tma1.

<>“Even beautiful, venerable and noble ladies would stoop
<>to folly. It is not the habit of women to leave away
<>charming men of wealth if they get them conveniently.
<>Any woman can be tamed if you please her in the
<>proper way. If women remain faithful to their husbands [Page548-a+ 62]
<>it is because they are afraid of scandal. They will enjoy
<>men without looking into their age or figure. The desire
<>for men in women can be compared to that of Antaka

<>the child was bathing in the Prabha1sati1rtha and kept
<>him inside a conch where the asura lived. The sage,
<>greatly griefstricken asked his disciples to get him back
<>his son as his Gurudaks2in2a1 (fees for the preceptor).
<>Accordingly S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and Balara1ma went to the
<>banks of the river and prayed to Varun2a. Varun2a
<>appeared before them and then they told him about
<>the mishap. With the help of Varun2a they killed the
<>asura Pan5caja and got back the son of their guru. The
<>conch in which the asura lived was taken by Kr2s2n2a.
<>Because the conch belonged to Pan5caja the conch got

<HI>PA1N5CA1LI1. Draupadi1, wife of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>i). {%Previous births.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 had many previous births.
<>During all these births many gods blessed her saying
<>that she would have five husbands when she was born
<>as the daughter of Drupada. Stories about her previous
<>births lying scattered in the Pura1n2as are given below:--
<NI>1) {%Ma1ya1si1ta1.%} When Ra1ma and Laks2man2a were in
<>exile in the forest with Si1ta1, Agni came to Ra1ma once
<>and told him in private thus: “Oh Ra1ma, you have
<>incarnated on earth to kill Ra1van2a. The time for that
<>is drawing nigh and ere long Ra1van2a would carry away
<>Si1ta1. It is not proper that Si1ta1, the incarnation of
<>Laks2mi1, should be touched by Ra1van2a. Therefore I
<>shall keep Si1ta1 safe with me and I am giving you a
<>phantom Si1ta1 to be with you in her stead.” S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>took the Ma1ya1si1ta1 from Agni without even Laks2man2a
<>knowing it and handed over the original Si1ta1 to the
<>custody of Agni.
<NI>While thus S4ri1 Ra1ma, Laks2man2a and Ma1ya1si1ta1 were
<>living together in their hermitage a golden deer was
<>seen one day in the precincts of their a1s4rama. Si1ta1
<>was enamoured of the beautiful deer and wanted it. So
<>Ra1ma keeping Laks2man2a to watch over Si1ta1 went in
<>search of the deer. S4ri1 Ra1ma tried his best to capture
<>the deer alive. But all his efforts failed and by that
<>time he had come far from the a1s4rama following the
<>deer. So he discharged an arrow and killed it. While
<>falling dead the deer raised a cry imitating that of
<>Ra1ma's and called Laks2man2a for help. The deer was
<>none other than Ma1ri1ca, the uncle of Ra1van2a. On
<>hearing the call for help Laks2man2a rushed to the spot
<>from where the sound came and Si1ta1 was left alone [Page549-a+ 64]
<>for some time. Ra1van2a came to the a1s4rama at that
<>time and took the Ma1ya1si1ta1 away to Lan3ka1.
<NI>Ra1ma and Laks2man2a went to Lan3ka1 with an army of
<>monkeys and after killing Ra1van2a took back Si1ta1 to
<>Ayodhya1. Then Ra1ma in deference to public opinion
<>put Si1ta1 into the fire to test her purity. At that time
<>god Agni taking back Ma1ya1si1ta1 gave the real Si1ta1 to
<>Ra1ma, unscathed by the fire. Then, when Ma1ya1si1ta1
<>was thus abandoned by Ra1ma she bowed down before
<>S4ri1 Ra1ma and Agni and asked them thus “What am I
<>to do now? Where should I go?” They advised her
<>to go to Pus2kara and do penance there and blessed
<>her saying that at the successful end of her penance
<>she would become Svargalaks2mi1. Paramas4iva was
<>pleased by her penance and appearing before her
<>asked her what boon she wanted. Ma1ya1si1ta1 who had
<>become Svargalaks2mi1 by then requested S4iva to give
<>her a husband. She repeated the request ‘Patim3 dehi’
<>(Give me a husband) five times and S4iva said that she
<>would have five husbands in her next life as the daugh-
<>ter of the King of Pa1n5ca1la with the name Kr2s2n2a1.
<>(9th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>ii) {%Na1la1yan2i1 (Indrasena1).%} Once there was an aged sage
<>named Maudgalya. Na1la1yan2i1 alias Indrasena1 was the
<>wife of Maudgalya. Even though the wife was young
<>and the husband old, Na1la1yan2i1 was very chaste. The
<>sage became very old, grey-haired and rugous, skeleton-
<>like with a foul smell emanating from his body. He
<>was always in an angry mood. Still Na1la1yan2i1 stuck to
<>him as a chaste, loving and dutiful wife. As time
<>passed on Maudgalya became a leper. One day while
<>the sage was eating, a finger of his broke and fell into
<>the rice. With great calmness and devotion Na1la1yan2i1
<>removed the finger from the rice and ate the rice.
<>Greatly pleased at this act of hers the sage asked her
<>what boon she wanted an she replied she desired to
<>have an amorous life with him as Pan5cas4ari1ra. Maud-
<>galya granted her the boon and they both travelled
<>the whole world enjoying an amorous life. When the
<>sage took the form of a mountain Na1la1yan2i1 became a
<>river and when the sage took the shape of a flowering
<>tree she became a creeper on it. They spent
<>thousands of years like that and then Maudgalya
<>became tired of a sexual life and returned to the
<>ascetic life. Even after such a long period of erotic
<>life Na1la1yan2i1 was still lustful and she resented the
<>decision of her husband to go back to the life of a
<>hermit. She begged her husband to continue the
<>same life for some more time. Maudgalya got cross
<>when she thus caused hindrance to his penance and
<>cursed her saying that she would in her next life be
<>born as the daughter of the King of Pa1n5ca1la when she
<>would have five husbands to satisfy her lust. Greatly
<>grieved at this curse she practised severe austerities
<>standing in the midst of Pan5ca1gni. Pleased with her
<>penance S4iva appeared before her and blessed her say-
<>ing that she would be born in her next birth in a very
<>noble family and she would then have five husbands,
<>good-natured, doing godly work and equal in valour
<>to Indra. She then pleaded that she should be
<>granted the boon to remain a virgin during the coitus
<>with each of her husbands. S4iva granted that wish.
<>Then S4iva sent her to the river Gan3ga1, and asked her
<>to fetch a beautiful young man whom she would be [Page549-b+ 65]
<>seeing there. Accordingly she went to the river to do
<>as she was directed.
<NI>At that time all the devas joined together and perform-
<>ed a Ya1ga at Naimis2a1ran2ya. Ka1la, the god of
<>Death, was one of the chief priests for the function.
<>The Ya1ga lasted for a long time and since Ka1la was
<>consecrated for the Ya1ga he did not attend to his
<>duties as the god of Death. Death came to a dead
<>stop and men increased in alarming numbers and the
<>devas were perplexed. They went to Brahma1 and
<>acquainted him with the frightening situation. Brahma1
<>sent them to Naimis2a1ran2ya. They went there and were
<>talking to Ka1la when they saw a few golden flowers
<>coming down the river. Getting curious Indra walked
<>up the river to locate the origin of these flowers. When
<>he reached the place of origin of Gan3ga1 he saw
<>Na1la1yan2i1 there. Na1la1yan2i1 took the beautiful young
<>man to S4iva. S4iva was at that time engaged in a
<>game of dice with Pa1rvati1 and Indra did not then re-
<>cognise S4iva. Indra in his arrogance argued that the
<>whole universe belonged to him. S4iva jumped up
<>enraged and ran after Indra who ran to the mouth of
<>a cave. S4iva caught him and said that he would show
<>him four Indras inside that cave. Both of them entered
<>the cave and to the amazement of Indra he saw four
<>other Indras sitting inside the cave. They were all the
<>creation of S4iva and with the original Indra the
<>number of Indras came to five. Then addressing
<>Na1la1yan2i1 who had followed them S4iva said, “Oh
<>beautiful girl, do not be worried. All these five are
<>your husbands. You will be born as the daughter of
<>the King of Pa1n5ca1la. Then all these five will
<>be born in the lunar race and will marry you.”
<NI>The Indras agreed to be born on earth and do the
<>work of God. After that they all went to Maha1vis2n2u
<>and requested him to give them mighty accomplices to
<>fulfil their mission. Then Maha1vis2n2u plucked two hairs
<>from his body, one white and the other black, and
<>dropped them on the ground. The black hair was
<>born as S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a and the white hair was born as
<>Balara1ma, to help the Pa1n2d2avas later.
<NI>Pa1n5ca1li1's two previous births can be explained thus:
<>Agnideva created Ma1ya1si1ta1 who in turn became Svarga-
<>laks2mi1 to be born as Pa1n5ca1li1. Ma1ya1si1ta1 was a part of
<>Maha1laks2mi1 and so also Na1la1yan2i1 who became Pa1n5ca1li1
<>was a part of Laks2mi1. Pa1n2d2avas are known to be the
<>sons of five gods and they used for the procreation of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas Indra1m3s4a (part of Indra) thus making
<>them all Indras. (Chapters 197 and 198, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Birth of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 was born in the palace of
<>Drupada, King of Pa1n5ca1la. She had a brother named
<>Dhr2s2t2adyumna. There is a story about their birth in
<>the Pura1n2as:
<NI>Drupada insulted Dron2a his classmate in the Gurukula
<>and Dron2a kept in mind the insult to wreak vengeance
<>on Drupada. Drupada, therefore, wanted a son to be
<>born who would defeat Dron2a in a battle. Brahmins
<>advised him to conduct a Ya1ga for that purpose. He
<>decided to conduct one on a large scale and went about
<>in search of a Yajva1 (one who performs sacrifices
<>according to Vedic rites) and reached Kalma1s2apuri1 on
<>the banks of the river Gan3ga1. There he saw a brahmin's
<>house where lived two sages named Ya1ja and Upaya1ja.
<>They were in figure and nature alike. At first Drupada
<>went to the younger of the two, Upaya1ja. He went near [Page550-a+ 65]
<>him and after massaging his feet and legs requested him
<>to officiate in a Ya1ga aimed at getting for him a son
<>to conquer Dron2a in a battle. He promised to give
<>him ten crores of cattle for that and also anything else
<>the sage wanted. These promises did not make the sage
<>consent to conduct the Ya1ga and so the King stayed
<>at the a1s4rama serving the sage. A year went by and
<>one day the sage appeared cheerful and told Drupada
<>thus: “Oh King, my brother who was walking one day
<>in a storm saw a fruit lying on his way and ate it with-
<>out first ascertaining whether the fruit was pure or not.
<>Again, I have seen him taking food from others freely
<>and eating it. I think he is wishful about wealth and,
<>perhaps, if you approach him he may help you.”
<NI>Drupada went to Ya1ja and after serving him to please
<>him made his request promising him much wealth. Ya1ja
<>was ready to perform the Yajn5a. Upaya1ja came to them
<>at that time and Ya1ja consulted his brother before going
<>to perform the Yajn5a. The Ya1ga was successfully
<>conducted and at the end the priest Ya1ja called the wife
<>of Drupada and gave her havya (clarified butter).
<>Because the havya was prepared by Ya1ja and was offered
<>by Upaya1ja the sages said that the queen would get two
<>children. While Ya1ja was offering oblations to the
<>sacrificial fire a boy with a crown on his head and
<>bearing a sword and a bow in his hands rose from the
<>fire. The r2s2is present there then said that, that boy would
<>kill Dron2a. He was named Dhr2s2t2adyumna. Then from
<>the dais of the Ya1ga-fire emerged a beautiful lady of
<>dazzling brilliance. Immediately a voice from heaven
<>was heard to say thus: “This Sumadhyama1 (a girl in
<>her blossoming youth) would work on the side of God
<>and will cause terror to the Kauravas.”
<NI>Ya1ja blessed the wife of Drupada saying that the
<>two children would thenceforth call her mother.
<>Ya1ja himself named the boy Dhr2s2t2adyumna and the
<>girl according to the ethereal voice, Kr2s2n2a1. Kr2s2n2a1 was
<>dark in complexion. Kr2s2n2a1 was called Pa1rs2at2i1 because she
<>was the grand-daughter of Pr2s2ata and Draupadi1 because
<>she was the daughter of Drupada and Pa1n5ca1li1 because
<>she was the daughter of the King of Pa1n5ca1la. Pa1n5ca1li1
<>grew up in the palace of Drupada. (Chapter 167, A1di
<>Parva).
<NI>3) {%Marriage.%} After escaping from the lac palace the
<>Pa1n2d2avas reached a village named Ekacakra1 after
<>walking a long time through the forests. There they
<>stayed in a brahmin's house. Every morning they
<>would go in disguise for begging and return with the
<>alms in the evening. This was their daily routine and
<>one day while they were in their daily round they saw
<>a group of brahmins and they said they were going to
<>the Svayam3vara of the daughter of the King of
<>Pa1n5ca1la. The brahmins invited them also to come
<>along with them describing in detail the beauty of the
<>girl and the elaborate and festive arrangements made
<>for the marriage. The Pa1n2d2avas went to Pa1n5ca1la along
<>with the brahmins. On the way they met Vedavya1sa
<>and receiving blessings from him they went to the
<>capital city of Pa1n5ca1la and took their abode in the
<>house of a potter. Nobody knew who they were.
<NI>Drupada had placed a mighty steel bow in the
<>marriage hall. When all the distinguished guests were
<>seated in the marriage hall, the King announced that
<>his daughter would be given in marriage to him who
<>bent the steel bow and with it shot a steel arrow, [Page550-b+ 65]
<>through the central aperture of a revolving disc, at a
<>target placed above. Many valiant princes from all
<>parts of Bha1rata including the Kauravas had gathered
<>there. When it was time for the ceremonies to begin
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 clad in beautiful robes with a bewitching
<>charm which excited the royal assemblage entered the
<>hall with a garland in her hands. Then Dhr2s2t2adyumna
<>brother of Pa1n5ca1li1 said “Hear ye, oh princes, seated in
<>state in this assembly, here is the bow and arrow. He
<>who sends five arrows in succession through the hole
<>in the wheel and unerringly hits the target shall win
<>my sister.”
<NI>Many noted princes rose one after another and tried
<>in vain to string the bow. It was too heavy and
<>stiff for them. Then Arjuna rose and meditating on
<>Na1ra1yan2a, the Supreme God, strung the bow with
<>ease and hit at the target. Pa1n5ca1li1 then put the gar-
<>land on Arjuna's neck and accepting him as her
<>husband went with him and stayed that night at the
<>house of the potter. Drupada that night went to the
<>house of the potter to make enquiries about his daugh-
<>ter and son-in-law. His joy knew no bounds when he
<>knew that his son-in-law was none other than the
<>celebrated Arjuna. The Pa1n2d2avas then took Pan5ca1li1
<>to their home in Ekacakra1 and as soon as Kunti1devi1
<>heard the footsteps of her sons outside she said from
<>inside asking them to share that day's alms among
<>themselves little knowing that it was a bride that
<>had been brought by them. Thus Pa1n5ca1li1 became the
<>common consort of the five Pa1n2d2avas. Then the
<>marriage of Pa1n5ca1li1 was ceremoniously conducted
<>after inviting friends and relatives. The Pa1n2d2avas then
<>built a new palace at Indraprastha and lived there.
<>(Chapters 190 to 220, A1di Parva).
<NI>S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a was present there along with the leading
<>members of the clan of Vr2s2n2i. He could recognise
<>the Pa1n2d2avas in spite of their disguise. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>went to the potter's house and visited them. He gave
<>them valuable presents on the occasion of their
<>marriage.
<NI>4) {%Making Draupadi1 naked.%} Once Duryodhana challeng-
<>ed Dharmaputra to a game of dice. Dharmaputra
<>lost all and in the end in despair pledged Draupadi1
<>and lost her. Immediately Duryodhana asked Vidura
<>to bring Draupadi1 to his palace and make her serve as
<>a servant-maid. Vidura did not consent to that. Then
<>Duryodhana asked Pra1tika1mi to bring her. While
<>entering the palace of Draupadi1, Pra1tika1mi was as
<>timid as a dog about to enter the cage of a lion. He
<>informed Draupadi1 of his mission. Draupadi1 sent him
<>back and then Duryodhana sent another messenger.
<>Draupadi1 went with him to the court of the Kauravas.
<>As soon as Dus4s4a1sana saw Draupadi1 he jumped at her
<>and caught hold of her hair and dragged her to the
<>centre of the assembly. When Dus4s4a1sana dragged her
<>thus she said in piteous tones “I am in my monthly
<>period and I have only the upper garment on me.
<>Please do not take me to the assembly.” Dus4s4a1sana
<>was not moved by these pleadings and he dragged her
<>still.
<NI>Bhi1ma could not hold himself calm against this atrocity
<>any longer and in a roar of wrath he abused Dharma-
<>putra for pledging Pa1n5ca1li1 thus and losing her.
<>Arjuna however remonstrated gently with Bhi1ma.
<>Then to the consternation of all, Dus4s4a1sana started his [Page551-a+ 64]
<>shameful work of pulling at Pa1n5ca1li1's robes to strip
<>her of all the clothes. All earthly aid having failed
<>Draupadi1 in utter helplessness implored divine mercy
<>and succour. Then a miracle occurred. In vain did
<>Dus4s4a1sana toil to pull the garments completely and
<>make her naked. As he pulled off each, fresh garments
<>were seen to come from somewhere and cover her
<>nudity. Dus4s4a1sana retired from his work exhausted and
<>disappointed. Then Karn2a ordered that Draupadi1
<>should be sent to the palace of Duryodhana as a
<>servant-maid. Hearing this Dus4s4a1sana once again
<>started dragging her. Draupadi1 wept. Bhi1ma roared
<>in fury and said that if his brother, Dharmaputra,
<>gave him permission he would at that instant smash to
<>death the Kauravas just like a lion killing the animals.
<>Bhi1s2ma and Dron2a interfered and pacified him.
<>Duryodhana stood up and striking his right thigh with
<>his right hand challenged Bhi1ma to a fight. Bhi1ma-
<>sena did not like Duryodhana exhibiting his naked
<>thigh in front of Draupadi1 and an angered Bhi1ma
<>declared that he would in a battle break Duryodhana's
<>thigh with his mace. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came to the
<>scene and pacified both of them and turning to
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 asked her to name any boon she wanted from
<>him. Pa1n5ca1li1 said: “In order that my son, Prativin-
<>dhya, should not be called a ‘da1saputra’ (son of a
<>servant) his father Dharmaputra should be released
<>from his servitude.” The boon was granted. Then she
<>requested that all the other Pa1n2d2avas should be set
<>free. That was also allowed. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra then asked
<>her to name a third boon. Pa1n5ca1li1 then said that all
<>Ks2atriya women were entitled only to two boons and
<>so there was no need for a third one. Then Draupadi1
<>took a vow that her hair which was let lose by the
<>wicked Dus4s4a1sana would be tied properly only by a
<>hand tainted by the blood of Dus4s4a1sana. After that in
<>strict obedience to the conditions of the wager the
<>Pa1n2d2avas started for the forests with Draupadi1 to
<>spend twelve years in the forests and one year
<>incognito. (Ten Chapters from Chapter 68, Sabha1
<>Parva).

<>Ka1myakavana, Kirmi1ra, the brother of Baka, came to
<>the a1s4rama where Pa1n5ca1li1 was taking rest. The demon
<>was such a fierce-looking giant that Pa1n5ca1li1 was forced
<>to shut her eyes by fright and she became wearied like
<>a river in the midst of five hillocks. Bhi1masena imme-
<>diately ran to her rescue and killed Kirmi1ra. (Chapter
<>11, Vana Parva).
<NI>(ii) Pa1n5ca1li1 consoled Dharmaputra by her soothing
<>words. (Chapter 27, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iii) Once when her woes became unbearable she
<>condemned the devas. (Chapter 3, Vana Parva).
<NI>(iv) While the Pa1n2d2avas were on the mountain
<>Gandhama1dana, Pa1n5ca1li1 persuaded Bhi1ma to bring for
<>her the Saugandhika flower. (See under Bhi1ma).
<NI>(v) While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in the Badarik-
<>a1s4rama waiting for the return of Arjuna who had gone
<>on a year's pilgrimage, Pa1n5ca1li1 was carried away by
<>Jat2a1sura. (See under Jat2a1sura). [Page551-b+ 64]
<NI>(vi) After she was rescued from Jat2a1sura, Pa1n5ca1li1
<>along with her husbands dwelt in the hermitage of
<>A1rs2t2is2en2a. (See under A1rs2t2is2en2a).
<NI>(vii) Once Draupadi1 gave instructions on the duties
<>of a wife to Satyabha1ma1 who came to the forests
<>along with S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a. (Chapters 233 and 234, Vana
<>Parva).
<NI>(viii) Once Durva1sas with his disciples came to the
<>forest as the guests of the Pa1n2d2avas. They came late
<>and Pa1n5ca1li1 had taken her food already. The
<>Aks2ayapa1tra (the never-empty pot) could not be
<>invoked to produce anything that day and Pa1n5ca1li1 was
<>greatly agitated and worried. She prayed to S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a
<>for succour and S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a also coming hungry searched
<>in the pot for something to eat and finding a bit of
<>spinach sticking to the sides of the pot grabbed it
<>with avidity and ate it. The guests felt as if they had
<>enjoyed a sumptuous feast and left the place well
<>pleased. (See para XII under Duryodhana).
<NI>(ix) Jayadratha carried away Pa1n5ca1li1 from the
<>forests once. The Pa1n2d2avas rescued her. (Para 4 under
<>Jayadratha).
<NI>6) {%Life incognito.%} After their twelve years of exile in
<>the forests the time for living in disguise for a year
<>came and Dharmaputra and his brothers with Pa1n5ca1li1
<>spent that period in the palace of the King Vira1t2a.
<>Each assumed a new name and accepted different
<>types of service under the King. Pa1n5ca1li1 took the
<>name of Sairandhri1 and served as a companion and
<>attendant to the princess. One day Ki1caka, the
<>mighty brother-in-law of the King, tried to molest
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 and Bhi1masena killed him. (See under
<>Ki1caka). It was at the time when the incognito life
<>was coming to an end that the Kaurava army headed
<>by Duryodhana carried away the cattle of the King
<>Vira1t2a. The King was absent from the palace at that
<>time and the prince, Uttara, had not the guts to go
<>and attack the Kaurava army. It was Pa1n5ca1li1 who
<>then suggested sending of Br2hannala of the palace
<>(Arjuna) to serve as charioteer of Uttara. (See under
<>Arjuna, Para 24).
<NI>7) {%Subsequent events.%} The thirteen years of life in
<>exile and incognito came to an end. But the Kauravas
<>were not prepared to give half of the kingdom to the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. The differences between them increased and
<>it led to a great war. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a agreed to go as a
<>messenger to the court of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra and ask for the
<>share of the Pa1n2d2avas. Before leaving he asked each of
<>the Pa1n2d2avas what he should say at the court of
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra. Pa1n5ca1li1 then approached Kr2s2n2a in
<>private and said she desired for a war to defeat the
<>Kauravas. She then reminded Kr2s2n2a of a vow taken
<>by Bhi1masena that he would tie her hair with his
<>hands smeared with the blood from the thigh of
<>Dus4s4a1sana.
<NI>The peace-mission of Kr2s2n2a failed and the famous
<>Kuruks2etra battle started. Many valiant warriors on
<>both the sides were killed. When Abhimanyu was
<>killed Subhadra1 wept bitterly and Pa1n5ca1li1 who went
<>to console her fainted. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a revived her. Pa1n5ca1li1
<>asked Bhi1masena to bring to her the inborn jewel on
<>the head of As4vattha1ma1, son of Dron2a. She wanted to
<>take revenge on him for killing her brother Dhr2s2t2a-
<>dyumna. [Page552-a+ 65]
<>After a fierce battle for eighteen days the Kauravas
<>were defeated and their tribe annihilated. Pa1n2d2avas
<>took hold of Hastina1pura and Pa1n5ca1li1 was one among
<>those who persuaded Dharmaputra to take charge of
<>the administration of the state as its ruler. Dharma-
<>putra performed an As4vamedhayajn5a and Pa1n5ca1li1 gave
<>presents to Citra1n3gada1 and Ulu1pi1 who were present
<>for the function then. After the As4vamedha Draupadi1
<>lived in Hastina1pura serving Kunti1 and Ga1ndha1ri1
<>alike for a long time. It was at that time that
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra, Ga1ndha1ri1 and Kunti1 went to the forests
<>and Draupadi1 expressed her desire to go along with
<>them to be of help to them. But they did not allow
<>her to do so. While the Pa1n2d2avas were living in
<>Hastina1pura as the rulers of the country eminent r2s2is
<>from different parts of the country visited them and
<>some of the Siddhas (realised souls) among them saw
<>Pa1n5ca1li1 as the goddess Maha1laks2mi1 herself. (S4loka 9,
<>Chapter 25, A1s4ramava1sika Parva).
<NI>8) {%Death of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} At the fag end of their life the
<>Pa1n2d2avas crowned Pari1ks2it as the King of Hastina1pura
<>and started on their Maha1prastha1na. They travelled
<>for long through the Hima1layas and reached Maha1-
<>meru. At that time Pa1n5ca1li1 fell down dead. Then
<>Bhi1masena asked Yudhis2t2hira why without any parti-
<>cular ailment Pa1n5ca1li1 died. Yudhis2t2hira replied that it
<>was because she showed special interest in Arjuna The
<>Pa1n2d2avas walked on and all of them excepting
<>Dharmaputra died on the way one by one. Even
<>before Dharmaputra entered svarga Pa1n5ca1li1 and the
<>four brothers had reached there. (Chapters 1 to 4,
<>Maha1prastha1nika Parva).
<NI>9). {%Sons of Pa1n5ca1li1.%} Pa1n5ca1li1 had five sons one each
<>from each of the five husbands. She got Prativindhya
<>of Yudhis2t2hira, S4rutasoma of Bhi1masena, S4rutaki1rti of
<>Arjuna, S4ata1ni1ka of Nakula and S4rutakarma1 of
<>Sahadeva. (S4loka 73, Chapter 95, A1di Parva).
<HI>PA1N5CA1LIKA (PA1N5CA1LIKES4A). A Yaks2a who was
<>a son of Kubera. In some parts of Bha1rata this Yaks2a
<>is worshipped as a deity. It is believed that S4iva had
<>given Pa1n5ca1li1ka a boon that he who worships him
<>whether he be man or woman, young or old, would
<>become intoxicated with vigour. There is a story
<>behind Pa1n5ca1lika obtaining this boon:--
<NI>When Sati1 who was insulted at the Daks2aya1ga was
<>cousumed by fire a bereaved S4iva sat inactive and
<>moody at a lonely place. When this continued for a
<>long time Ka1madeva (god of love) at the request of
<>the other devas sent arrows against him and made him
<>lustful. S4iva then started running passionately calling
<>the name of his wife and finding her nowhere jumped
<>into the river Ka1lindi1 to commit suicide. (The
<>waters of Ka1lindi1 became black from that time on-
<>wards). Ka1lindi1 was unable to bear the burden of
<>the soul of S4iva and so he had to get out to the shore
<>and run again. At this time Ka1madeva sent another
<>arrow, unma1da1stra (arrow of intoxication) also against
<>S4iva. S4iva could not bear the impact of the two
<>arrows together and he laboured under great strain.
<>Just then he saw Pa1n5ca1lika son of Kubera coming that
<>way. S4iva then made him understand his difficulties
<>and requested him to take charge of the force of the
<>arrows from him. Pa1n5ca1lika did so and saved S4iva
<>from his toil. Pleased at this S4iva blessed him. He
<>said that Pa1n5ca1lika will be worshipped by people in [Page552-b+ 65]
<>the month of Caitra and all those who do so will be
<>invigorated. He added that henceforth he would be
<>known as Pa1n5ca1likes4a also.
<HI>PA1N5CA1LYA. An a1s4rama of ancient Bha1rata. This was
<>the place where Nyagrodha, King of Pa1n5ca1la, perform-
<>ed penance for a long time. (S4loka 11, Chapter 90,
<>Vana Parva).
<HI>PAN5CAMAHA1YAJN5A. For a Gr2hastha1s4rami1 (house-
<>holder) the following five apparatuses are unavoidable:
<>A sifter, a grinding stone, a broom, a wooden mortar
<>and a water-pot. It is believed that a sin is committed
<>when each of these is used and to remove the sins thus
<>committed the ancient sages have prescribed five
<>yajn5as and these five yajn5as are called the Pan5camaha1-
<>yajn5as. They are the Brahmayajn5a, Pitr2yajn5a,
<>Devayajn5a, Bhu1tayajn5a and the Ma1nus2ayajn5a.
<>Reciting of Vedas is Brahmayajn5a. Pleasing the
<>manes by offering rice or libations of water is called
<>Pitr2yajn5a. Giving offerings to the demi-gods in the
<>sacrificial fire is called Devayajn5a and religious
<>offerings of rice to the crows is called Bhu1tayajn5a.
<>Giving food for the guests is Ma1nus2ayajn5a. One who
<>does not do the Pan5camaha1yajn5as is no better than dead.
<>Some scholars have classified the Pan5camaha1yajn5as
<>as Huta, Prahuta, Bra1hmyahuta, Pra1s4ita and Ahuta.
<Poem>Japo huto huto homah2
<>Prahuto bhautiko balih2 //
<>Bra1hmyam3 hutam3 dvija1gnyarcca1
<>Pra1sitam pitr2tarpan2am. //</Poem>
<NI>Ahuta is Brahmayajn5a, huta is devayajn5a, prahuta is
<>bhu1tayajn5a, bra1hmyahuta is ma1nus2ikayajn5a and
<>pra1s4ita is pitr2yajn5a. Even if at times one finds it not
<>possible to do ma1nus2ikayajn5a one must perform daily
<>brahmayajn5a and daivayajn5a. The offerings given to
<>gods in the sacrificial fire go to the Sun. The Sun
<>sends rains to the earth which in turn make the plants
<>flourish. Vedas say that thus living beings increase. Just
<>as all animals and objects depend on life-breath for
<>living, a Brahmaca1ri1, a Va1naprastha and a Sannya1si1
<>depend upon a gr2hastha for sustenance. Therefore, the
<>Gr2hastha1s4rama is the best of all a1s4ramas. (Chapter 3,
<>Manu1smr2ti).
<HI>PAN5CAMI1, An ancient river of Uttara Bha1rata. People
<>used to drink water from this river. Chapter 9, Bhi1s2ma
<>Parva).
<HI>PAN5CANADA I. A land of the north-western side of
<>Bha1rata. This is at present called the Punjab. When
<>Nakula conquered the western states he conquered
<>Pan5canada also. (S4loka 11, Chapter 32, Maha1bha1rata).
<>Five rivers of names Vipa1s4a1 (Vya1sa), S4atadru1 (Sutlej),
<>Ira1vati1 (Ra1vi1), Cndrabha1ga1 (Chenab) and Vitasta1
<>(Jhelum) run through this place and that is why the
<>place is called Pan5canada.
<HI>PAN5CANADA II. A sacred place in Kuruks2etra. If one
<>bathes in the holy pond of Kot2iti1rtha there, one would
<>get the benefit of performing an As4vamedha. (Chapter
<>83, Vana Parva).
<HI>PAN5CAPRA1N2AS. The five pra1n2as (life breaths) of any
<>living being are Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Vya1na, Sama1na and
<>Uda1na. There is a story in ‘Devi1 Bha1gavata’ regarding
<>the origin of the Pan5capra1n2as.
<NI>Once S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a met Ra1dha1devi1 at Ra1saman2d2ala and in
<>seclusion they spent in sexual sport the period of one day
<>of Brahma1. Then Kr2s2n2a selecting an auspicious time
<>dropped his vital fluid into her womb at the end of the [Page553-a+ 65]
<>sexual sport. Tired by the prolonged carnal sport and
<>shaken by the impact of the hot semen Ra1dha1devi1 pers-
<>pired profusely and the exhaustion produced deep and
<>long breaths. The whole universe was covered with her
<>sweat and her sighs became the goddess of the life-giving
<>breaths of all created animals. From the left side of
<>goddess was born Va1yupatni1 and to her were born the
<>Pan5capra1n2as. Besides these, another five younger pra1n2as
<>were also born. From the sweat of the Devi1 was born
<>Varun2a and from the left side of Varun2a was born
<>Varun2a1ni1. (9th Skandha, Devi1 Bha1gavata).
<NI>Ma1n2d2u1kyopanisad gives the following details regarding
<>the working of the Pra1n2as in the body:--Pra1n2a was
<>first used in the sense of breath. Later it got the mean-
<>ing of life. Life is in fact breath to all living beings. Only
<>when a man is awake, his mind and sense organs
<>are active. But Pra1n2a is active always both in the state
<>of wakefulness and sleep. Therefore Pra1n2a is the vigour
<>of life. It may be said that when a man is asleep his
<>senses merge with his mind and his mind with the
<>pra1n2a. The five factors of Pra1n2a are the Pan5capra1n2as.
<>The first of the five is called Pra1n2a itself. It is called
<>Mukhyapra1n2a or chief Pra1n2a. Just as a King appoints
<>his ministers at different places to do specified jobs the
<>chief Pra1n2a posts the other pra1n2as at different parts in
<>the body with specific purposes of their own. Pra1n2a is
<>seated in the heart and does the work of breathing.
<>Apa1na is seated in anus and directs the organs of
<>excretion of the body. Vya1na is spread throughout the
<>body and it is this life-wind which keeps one alive even
<>when breathing is stopped for some time. When an
<>archer stands in deep concentration with his bent bow
<>without breathing he lives with the help of Vya1na.
<>Sama1na controls the breathing-in and breathing-out to
<>a specified rhythm. Sama1na (equaliser) is so called
<>because it balances the force of the in-coming and out-
<>going breaths. There is a school of thought that Pra1n2a
<>is not seated in the heart but spread over the ears, eyes
<>nose and face. Sama1na is seated at the navel midway
<>between the seats of Pra1n2a and Apa1na. This is also a
<>reason why life wind got that name. This breath does
<>the work of prompting digestion. The four pra1n2as,
<>Pra1n2a, Apa1na, Sama1na and Vya1na sustain life. The
<>fifth one, Uda1na, takes the soul of the being out of
<>the body when it dies.
<HI>PAN5CA1PSARAS. A lake of distinction. During the exile
<>of S4ri1 Ra1ma in the forests, Agastya showed S4ri1 Ra1ma
<>this lake and described its origin thus: “In times of old
<>a sage named Ma1n2d2akarn2i built this lake. This sage
<>living on air alone stood in the waters of this lake and
<>practised severe austerities for ten thousand years.
<>Devas were frightened by the rigorous penance of
<>Ma1n2d2akarn2i and they sent five devakanyaka1s (celestial
<>damsels) to the earth to entice the sage and stop his
<>penance. Tke sage was attracted by the divine beauty
<>of the girls and he lived with them in a grand building
<>constructed within the lake itself. Even after the passing
<>away of the sage and the damsels people used to hear
<>dance and music from inside the lake. Because five
<>apsaras lived in that lake it became known as Pan5ca1-
<>psaras.
<NI>(Apsaras = celestial damsels who are servants of Indra).

<HI>PAN5CARA1TRA. An a1gama (a system of philosophy).
<>(Chapter 218, S4a1nti Parva). [Page553-b+ 65]
<HI>PA1N5CARA1TRA. A book of spiritual doctrines. He who
<>learns this will attain the position of Uparicaravasu.
<>S4loka 25, Chapter 325, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PAN5CAS4IKHA. A sage of ancient times. The Pura1n2as
<>give the following details about him.
<NI>He was a disciple of A1suri. He was brought up breast-
<>fed by Kapila1, wife of A1suri and so he was known as
<>Ka1pila also. He dwelt in Pan5casrotas and performed a
<>Ya1ga for a thousand years and got his name Pan5cas4ikha.
<>He went to the assembly of the learned king Janaka and
<>entered into a polemic contest with him and defeated
<>him. The defeated King gave Pan5cas4ikha great respect
<>and he lived in the court of Janaka as his Guru for a
<>number of years. (Chapter 218, S4a1nti Parva).
<HI>PAN5CA1S4VA. A King of the Puru race. (See under Puru-
<>vam3s4a).
<HI>PAN5CATANTRA.
<NI>A. {%General information.%} An ancient book of distinction
<>written by the scholar Vis2n2us4arma1 in the form of
<>stories for the use of children to give them an idea of
<>the different aspects of life.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} There is a statement in the preface itself
<>regarding the composition of this book: “Three sons
<>were born to an emperor named Amaras4akti. All the
<>three were dull-witted. The emperor was very sorry
<>for them but found no way to improve them. Greatly
<>disappointed the King called the royal council and
<>told them about his sons. Then one of the members of
<>the council, a man named Sumati, stood up and said
<>“Oh best of Kings, let us not try to teach your children
<>the s4a1stras one by one. It will not only be unpleasant
<>study but would also take a long time to complete.
<>If we can mix all the s4a1stras cleverly and make it palat-
<>able like sweetmeats the children would take it
<>easily. There is a suitable man also for this work in our
<>state. He is Vis2n2us4arma1, a kind-hearted scholar who
<>is not only well-versed in all the sa1stras but also an
<>adept in the art of the up-bringing of children. I am
<>sure he would make your children wise and learned.”
<>When the emperor heard this he sent for Vis2n2us4arma1
<>and told him everything. After understanding well the
<>nature of his would-be disciples and the ambition of
<>their father, Vis2n2us4arma1 took charge of his wards and
<>within six months he taught the sons of the emperor
<>the science of government. The stories which he used
<>to teach them the science of administration were all
<>compiled into a volume called Pan5catantra.”
<NI>2) {%A general idea of the book.%} The book contains five
<>divisions each division illustrating one tantra (tact,
<>diplomacy) by several stories. It contains prose and
<>verse. The first tantra is called Mitrabheda. Stories
<>under this head explain the philosophy of “Divide
<>and rule” in politics. The main characters in these
<>stories are two foxes named Karat2aka and Damanaka.
<>Stories under Mitrabheda relate to how these sly foxes
<>enjoy themselves in breaking the intimacy between a
<>lion and an ox using slander against each other.
<>‘Mitrala1bha’ is the theme of the next tantra. It is an
<>advice that you should select your friends with
<>care selecting them only after studying them in detail
<>properly. The author has selected as characters in
<>his stories for this purpose a tortoise a deer, a crow
<>and a rat. The third tantra is called Ka1kolu1ki1ya. This
<>deals with the evils behind an intimacy between born
<>enemies. The main characters in the stories relating [Page554-a+ 65]
<>to this are a crow and an owl. The fourth tantra is
<>called Labdhapran2a1s4a. It describes how a man loses
<>what has come into his possession by his foolishness. A
<>monkey and a crocodile are the characters in this story.
<>The fifth tantra is Apari1ks2itaka1raka. It deals with the
<>bad side of not looking into all the possible aspects of
<>what you hear. Several stories are there to illustrate
<>this point.
<NI>3) {%Popularity of the book.%} Though no correct records
<>are there in history in support of the belief, it is believ-
<>ed that Amaras4akti was the ruler of Mahila1ropya in
<>Deccan and that Pan5catantra must have originated
<>from there. But Pan5catantra received a global publicity
<>and popularity and was translated from Sanskrit into
<>many other languages. Directed by King Kosru Anu-
<>s2irva, a Persian poet named Buryoe translated it into
<>the Persian language during the period 531-575 A.D.
<>That translation is not available at present. In the year
<>570 A.D. it was translated into the Syrian language by
<>a poet named Bud. A scholar named Abdulla Ibaal
<>Mogaffa in the year 750 A. D. translated it into the
<>Arabic language. It was from this Arabic translation that
<>it was translated into many European languages. The
<>Greek translation appeared in the year 1080 A.D.,
<>Hebrew in 1100 A.D., Latin in 1270 A.D., German in
<>1480 A.D., Italian in 1582 A.D. and French in 1678
<>A.D. Next to the Bible this is the book which has
<>received the greatest publicity and popularity. The
<>great linguist Hertel says that Pan5catantra has appeared
<>in about 200 translations in fifty different languages.
<NI>4) {%Period of composition.%} Because the translation into
<>the Syrian language appeared in the year 570 A.D it
<>must have been composed earlier than that date. Again,
<>since it takes at least two centuries for a work to get
<>popular enough to be translated into a foreign language,
<>the composition must have been done early in the fourth
<>century A.D. Some believe that the work was done in
<>Kashmir. While others assert that it was written in
<>Magadha. The original title of the book is believed to
<>be ‘Karataka and Damanaka’ by a few.
<NI>5) {%Two editions.%} Two different editions of the book are
<>now found. One edition popular in Kashmir is known
<>as Tantra1khya1yika1. The other is in the form found in
<>Katha1saritsa1gara and Br2hatkatha1man5jari1. The original
<>Sanskrit work is very rarely found. There are
<>several editions of this in Daks2in2a Bha1rata. Changes in
<>the stories according to the change of times are also
<>noted. (History of Classical Sanskrit Literature).
<NI>B. {%Contents (Stories).%}
<NI>1) {%Mitrabheda.%} There was once a very good merchant
<>in the land of Mahila1ropya called Vardhama1na. He
<>was once travelling in a bullock-cart. One of the
<>bullocks drawing the cart was named San5ji1vaka. The
<>leg of San5ji1vaka broke on the way striking against a
<>stone. Leaving the bullock to the charge of four of his
<>attendants Vardhama1na continued his journey. When
<>night came the attendants were frightened by the
<>surrounding forests and so, leaving the bullock to its
<>fate the attendants left the place. The bullock got well
<>and it roamed about in the forests bellowing loudly.
<>The King of the forests, Pin3galaka the lion, was
<>frightened by the bellowing of the bullock.
<NI>The lion remained in the forest without stirring out
<>from its cave. The minister of the lion was a fox. That
<>fox had two sons named Karat2aka and Damanaka. [Page554-b+ 65]
<>Damanaka wanted to know what made the lion worried
<>and told his brother about it. Karat2aka advised him
<>not to interfere unnecessarily with the affairs of others
<>and told his brother Damanaka a story to stress his
<>point.
<NI>A group of sawers were sawing wood near a temple
<>for its construction. At lunch time one of the sawers
<>placed a wedge on a half-sawn timber and went for
<>his midday meal. One of the monkeys sitting on the
<>branch of a tree near the temple jumped on to the half-
<>sawn timber and pulled out the wedge. His tail had
<>fallen without his knowing into the space between
<>the sawn planks and when the monkey later jumped
<>out from the timber his tail was wedged between the
<>planks and the tail got crushed. If you poke your nose
<>into the affairs of others without any purpose such
<>dangers are sure to happen.
<NI>Hearing that, Damanaka said, “Brother, are we serving
<>the lion, our master, just for our food? If we want only
<>our food what difference is there between ourselves and
<>the dog? Have you not seen the uproar the dogs
<>make when they see food. A dog has no modesty,
<>humility or self-confidence. Some men are also like that.
<>But some others are not like that. Look at the elephant.
<>It never makes an exhibition of its happiness when it
<>gets its food. Its majestic stand, look and gestures are
<>worth noticing. The best of men are also like this.
<>Everybody should keep this in mind. He who earns his
<>livelihood without depending on others but does it by
<>his own wits and efforts is the most revered of men.
<>But food is not enough, we must earn fame also.
<>So even though we are children we must try to remove
<>the worry that hangs over our lord, the lion.”
<>The brother was not moved by this philosophy of
<>Damanaka and so he said again, “Anywhere and in any
<>venture success is difficult to achieve and failure is very
<>easy. It is difficult to rise up but it is easy to fall down.
<>It is a very hard labour to roll a stone up a mountain
<>but to push it down from the top is very easy. He is
<>blessed who can read correctly the thoughts of other
<>people. I have, looking at the face of our King, under-
<>stood that something big is worrying him.”
<NI>Karat2aka said, “Admitting what you say to be correct
<>how are we to know the thing that worries the King?
<>It is a dangerous task.” Damanaka said “Regarding the
<>achievement of success, there are three kinds of people
<>namely the Uttama (best), the madhyama (mediocre)
<>and the adhama (worst). The adhama type will never
<>start a venture fearing failure. The madhyama type
<>would start his endeavour but would turn back at the
<>sight of obstacles. But the Uttama type would never
<>turn back without achieving success. They are the
<>adorable type of men in this world. The Uttama
<>would act according to the circumstances of the situa-
<>tion. If he wants to talk to another and obtain a favour
<>from him he would not go to him at random without
<>looking into the time, place and opportunity to do so.
<>Even Br2haspati has his moods. In fact, there is nothing
<>impossible in this world. Disappointment and failures
<>are due to want of experience and lack of endeavour.
<>The great ocean with its huge rolling waves gives one
<>a fright at first sight. But if he starts bathing in it for
<>a long time he finds it not so unapproachable or
<>ghastly.”
<NI>When Karat2aka heard these moral preachings of his [Page555-a+ 65]
<>brother he allowed him to do what he wanted to do.
<>Damanaka went to the cave of the lion. Far from the
<>cave itself Damanaka started walking humbly with his
<>head bent down. The lion saw Damanaka walking
<>thus to him and was immensely pleased. The King of
<>the beasts asked him thus “Damanaka, it is a long time
<>since I saw you and your brother. Why is it that you
<>both, sons of my minister, do not come and see me as
<>often as your father?”
<NI>Damanaka replied very humbly “Oh mighty King, of
<>what use can we insignificant creatures be to you? Yet,
<>if one thinks over it, even little things can also be of use
<>at times to great people.” Damanaka then recited to the
<>King a poem which in substance was thus: “Even grass
<>over which we trample while walking, is of use as fodder
<>to the cattle. Some are used for cleaning the teeth and
<>still some, dry and brittle, to tickle the ear when it
<>itches badly. Great men retain their greatness even
<>when they fall. A burning torch would send its flame only
<>upwards even when you keep it upside down. Similarly
<>all things will shine only in their proper places. An
<>ornamental waistbelt would not shine round a neck nor
<>would bangles shine on one's ears. Anyhow let me ask
<>your highness one question. Is it true that when your
<>highness went to drink water something happened to
<>make your highness worry ?”
<NI>Pin3galaka the lion said: “What you say is correct. When
<>I went today to drink water in the river I heard the
<>horrifying bellow of a fierce animal and was frightened.
<>I am thinking of leaving this forest and going to some
<>other one.”
<NI>Damanaka said “Oh Lord, be not frightened. Appear-
<>ances are often deceptive and cannot be believed. I
<>shall tell you the story of a fox who mistook an ordinary
<>drum for an animal with good flesh. Once a fox saw
<>a drum lying in a battlefield. It was making a sound
<>when the wind blew over it. The fox mistook it for an
<>animal with plenty of flesh and blood. Rejoicing at the
<>prospect of having a hearty meal the fox mustered
<>courage and went near it. It tore the leather open. Only
<>then could it understand its blunder.”
<NI>The King liked the story very much. So he sent
<>Damanaka to enquire where the bellow came from.
<>Damanaka found out San5ji1vaka, the ox and told him
<>everything and added that he had been sent by the
<>King to fetch him to his presence. San5ji1vaka was at first
<>afraid to go but the consoling words of Damanaka
<>gave him courage and it went to the lion. The lion and
<>the ox became great friends and gradually the intimacy
<>developed to such an extent that the King of the beasts
<>started becoming indifferent to the welfare of the other
<>beasts in the forest. The subjects of the King Pin3galaka
<>were in trouble.
<NI>Feeling sorry for his own actions Damanaka went to his
<>brother and said, “All this happened because of our own
<>fault. I shall tell you a story about a self-made calamity.
<>Once an ascetic named Devas4arma1 was afraid of
<>robbers. So he stitched into his robes all the money he
<>possessed. Somehow a robber named A1s2a1d2habhu1ti came
<>to know of it and he made friends with the ascetic and
<>acted as his servant pretending to be very faithful.
<>Devas4arma1 got confidence in him and one day he went
<>to bathe handing over all his guarded wealth into the
<>hands of A1s2a1d2habhu1ti. On his way back from the river
<>after his bath Devas4arma1 saw two goats fighting against [Page555-b+ 65]
<>each other. Blood was flowing from the heads of both
<>the goats and still the fight continued. A fox came
<>there to drink the fresh blood flowing from their heads
<>and he went and started licking the blood that had
<>dropped between the two fighting goats. The goats
<>came again and hit against each other with force and
<>the fox that was standing between the two and licking
<>the blood greedily was crushed to death. When he
<>returned after witnessing the fight the ascetic found
<>that his servant had gone away with his cash.”
<NI>Karat2aka liked the story very much. They then discuss-
<>ed ways and means of getting out of this calamity.
<>Damanaka said that any object can be achieved by
<>cleverness and told his brother a story to illustrate his
<>point. He said “Once a crow made his abode on a tree
<>with his wife and children. After some time his wife
<>began to lay eggs but all of them disappeared one by
<>one. They made enquiries and found that the culprit
<>was a big cobra living beneath the same tree. They
<>were no match to the cobra and so they sought the
<>advice of their friend, a fox.
<NI>The fox said, “I shall suggest a way to get out of the
<>danger. Have you not heard the story of an old stork
<>who got his food by his cleverness? The stork went to
<>the banks of a pond feeling hungry. There were plenty
<>of fishes in the pond. The stork stood still on the banks
<>pretending to be sad. A crab seeing the sad-looking
<>stork came and enquired the cause of his grief. The
<>stork said ‘You well know that we storks live on flesh.
<>and fish. I now understand that a fisherman has planned
<>to catch all the fish in this pond. This is the cause of
<>my worry.” The fishes who overheard this conver-
<>sation between the crab and the stork came before the
<>stork frightened and requested him to save them from
<>the fisherman somehow. The stork said ‘I am not strong
<>to fight the fisherman. But I can do what little help
<>I can give you. I shall every day remove you one by one
<>from this pond to another one without the knowledge
<>of the fisherman.”
<NI>The poor fishes agreed to the proposal and the stork
<>carried away one fish everyday from the pond and ate
<>it at a place hidden from the view of the others. This
<>went on for one or two months without break and
<>somehow the crab got suspicious and he requested the
<>stork to take him also to the other pond. The stork
<>carrying the crab reached its usual place and the crab
<>was horrified at the sight of the bones of the fishes
<>eaten before by the stork. The crab knew its death
<>was sure even if it did not fight with the stork and so
<>started a fight and in the end killed the stork by
<>crushing the neck of the stork.”
<NI>The crows crew hilariously when they heard the
<>story of the fox. The fox then told them a plan.
<>“When any of those who come to bathe in a pond near-
<>by removes the necklace and places it on the shore you
<>are to pick it up and hang it on a branch of the tree.”
<>The crows did like that and pedestrians going that way
<>saw the necklace hanging from the branch and took it
<>after killing the cobra in the hole beneath the tree.”
<NI>On hearing the story told by Damanaka the idea of
<>putting the lion against the ox gained strength in
<>Karat2aka's mind. To confirm the idea in his brother's
<>mind Damanaka told another story. Damanaka said.
<>“Once there was a lion named Madotkat2a. He lived
<>in a forest harassing all the beasts that lived there. [Page556-a+ 65]
<NI>All the subjects of King Madotkat2a joined together,
<>went to him and represented to him that they would
<>go to his cave one by one every day to be killed and
<>eaten by him. The lion agreed to that and the beasts
<>one by one went to his cave each day. One day it was
<>the turn of a clever hare. The hare walked slowly and
<>reached the lion's den late. The King was very cross
<>at this and asked him to explain why he was late. The
<>hare said “Oh lord, on my way another lion accosted
<>me and I had to take a round-about route to get away
<>from that lion.” The lion got angry and asked the
<>hare to take him to the other lion who dared to come
<>to that forest and question his authority. The hare
<>took the lion to a well and asked his lord to peep in.
<>When Madotkat2a did so he saw his own reflection in
<>the still waters of the well and mistook it for another
<>lion. It jumped into the well and was killed.”
<NI>Karat2aka had implicit confidence in Damanaka after
<>hearing all these stories and he sent his brother to the
<>King to create a rupture between the lion and the ox.
<>Damanaka went to the King Pin3galaka and apologised
<>for the mistake he had committed. Then the King
<>enquired what the mistake was. Damanaka said that
<>the ox San5ji1vaka was not such a simpleton as he took
<>him to be. He was ambitious and wanted to snatch
<>away the kingdom from Pin3galaka. It was unwise to
<>keep one single minister always. “After all what can an
<>ox do? He can plough the fields. I have come to
<>inform you all these out of my regard for you.”
<>Damanaka said.
<NI>Even after hearing all these, Pin3galaka did not have
<>the heart to abandon the ox. Pin3galaka asked what a
<>poor bullock could do against a lion. Damanaka then
<>said that one would come into grief if one believed too
<>much in any body. “Have you not heard the story of
<>the louse which believed the bug?” Damanaka asked.
<>Then he narrated a story. “Mandavisarpin2i1 was a
<>louse which was living happily on the silken bed of a
<>King. A bug went there and made friends with the
<>louse. The poor louse believed the bug to be harmless
<>and allowed it to stay that night with him. The
<>bug said that it was very greedy to suck the blood of
<>the King. At night the bug bit the King. The King
<>woke up and ordered his servants to search for the
<>thing that bit him. When lights were brought the
<>clever bug slipped away. The royal servants conduct-
<>ing the search found out the louse and killed it.”
<NI>The lion liked the tale very much and yet was reluc-
<>tant to dismiss the ox. The lion wanted proof that
<>the ox was at fault. So Damanaka went straight to the
<>ox in his house and said “We are all small people.
<>What does the master do for our welfare? If small
<>people seek the friendship of big people the small ones
<>will always suffer.” The ox endorsed the view and told
<>a story to illustrate the truth. “A lion named Madot-
<>kat2a had a tiger, a fox and a crow as his ministers.
<>When the ministers were once walking in the forest
<>they saw a camel. They had never seen a camel before
<>and so they were wonderstruck by the animal. They
<>went and talked with it and gathered that the curious
<>animal was a camel which had been carrying loads for
<>a merchant. It had now escaped from the merchant
<>because of the heavy work it had to do. The camel
<>wanted to remain in hiding. The ministers took the
<>new animal to the lion. The lion liked the camel very [Page556-b+ 65]
<>much and soon they became good and intimate friends.
<>The intimacy increased and soon the King lost all
<>interest in his other subjects. At this stage the minis-
<>ters found out a plan. They advised the King to kill
<>and eat the camel but the King refused to do so. Then
<>the crow went before the King and requested the lion
<>to kill and eat it. But the crow was so small a food for
<>the lion and so it refused to kill the crow. Then the
<>fox made a similar offer but the lion refused to kill the
<>fox also. Then came the tiger with the offer and the
<>lion refused to kill the tiger also. Seeing all this the
<>camel also made a similar offer and the moment his
<>consent was out from his mouth the fox and the tiger
<>together killed the poor camel and ate it. So one
<>should be careful in believing others. In my case I
<>am sure some wicked persons must have advised him
<>against me and that is the reason why the lion is
<>angry with me. But I will always work true to my con-
<>science. There is no harm in fighting either for self-
<>protection or for destroying one's enemies. So if it is
<>necessary I will fight the lion.”
<NI>Hearing this Damanaka said “To go to war with-
<>out knowing the strength of the enemy is wrong. Once
<>upon a time a water-fowl quarrelled with the ocean.
<>The water-fowl was living happily on the shores of an
<>ocean with his mate. They ate the worms that lived
<>on the shores. The she-fowl got pregnant and when it
<>was time to lay her eggs she asked her mate to show her
<>a safe place to lay the eggs. The male mate asked her
<>to lay the eggs on the shore itself. But the she-fowl
<>said that the waves would carry away the eggs and so
<>it was not wise to do so. The male fowl assured her that
<>the ocean was not bold enough to do anything against
<>his interests. But the she-fowl still hesitated.
<NI>Then the male fowl said “I am the nearest relative res-
<>ponsible for your protection and welfare. If one does not
<>heed the words of a relative one will fall into danger.
<>I shall tell you the story of a tortoise which came to
<>grief by not obeying the instructions of its friends. In
<>olden times there lived on the banks of a pond a tor-
<>toise who had two swan-friends in the lake named
<>San3kat2a and Vikat2a. Once the lake became empty of
<>water and the swans decided to go to another lake with
<>water. They never wanted to part with their friend the
<>tortoise and so decided to take the tortoise also along
<>with them. But the tortoise could not fly and so
<>they found a plan to carry the tortoise to the other lake.
<>They brought a stick and the tortoise was asked to hang
<>at the middle of the stick clutching the stick tightly
<>with its teeth. The swans then took the stick by its
<>two ends each holding one end in its beak. The swans
<>gave strict instructions that the tortoise should not open
<>its mouth and then rose up into the air and flew
<>towards the other lake. On the way some children saw
<>the funny sight in the air and so hooted and howled.
<>The tortoise got angry and abused the children. The
<>moment it opened its mouth it lost hold on the stick
<>and fell down to the ground This happened because the
<>tortoise did not heed the words of its friends.” The
<>water fowl continued ‘It is cowardice and foolishness to
<>remain sad expecting dangers in future. Just hear this
<>story’ he said ‘Once in a pond there were three fishes
<>named Ana1gata, Utpannamati and Yadbhavis2ya. Hear-
<>ing that fishermen were coming to fish in that pond
<>Ana1gata warned them and suggested going to another [Page557-a+ 65]
<>pond to escape from the fishermen. But Utpannamati
<>and Yadbhavis2ya did not care. They said that some
<>plan could be found out when the danger came. But
<>Ana1gata felt diffident and so he went away to another
<>pond. Soon the fishermen came and spread their nets.
<>Utpannamati lay still pretending to be dead. The
<>fishermen took it and deposited it on the shore and
<>started to fish again. The moment the fishermen turned
<>their heads Utpannamati slipped into a mud pit nearby
<>and remained there till the departure of the fishermen.
<>But poor Yadbhavis2ya could not think of any plan and
<>so was caught and carried away by the fishermen. So
<>just like Utpannamati I will also come across some plan
<>when the danger comes and so you do lay your eggs
<>on the shore of the ocean itself.”
<NI>Hearing the assuring words of her husband the she-
<>fowl laid her eggs on the shore. But very soon waves
<>came and carried them away. She complained to her
<>husband. The water fowl called a conference of all the
<>birds living there and explained to them his mishap
<>and all of them went on a deputation to Garud2a, the
<>best of the birds and requested him to find out a re-
<>medy. Garud2a represented the matter to Maha1vis2n2u
<>who in turn called Varun2a to his side and ordered him
<>to give back the eggs to the fowl.
<NI>After telling this story Damanaka went to the lion and
<>told him many misleading lies about the ox. Gradually
<>the lion and the ox became enemies. Damanaka then
<>triumphantly went and informed his brother Karat2aka
<>of his achievement. But Karat2aka said “Brother, you
<>have done a very unjust thing. There are four methods
<>to achieve your object namely, Sa1ma, Da1na, Bheda
<>and Dan2d2a. Of these Bheda is to be used only last of
<>all. I shall tell you a story:
<NI>Once a chetty (Merchant) had two sons named Dharma-
<>buddhi and Dus2t2abuddhi. Once they were both travel-
<>ling through a forest when Dharmabuddhi got a trea-
<>sure from a hole at the base of a big tree. Dus2t2abuddhi
<>advised his brother not to take the treasure to the city
<>as it was dangerous to do so and made him bury it at
<>a place beneath the same tree. That night itself
<>Dus2t2abuddhi went and dug out the treasure and got it
<>buried in his own room. After some days both of them
<>went together to see the treasure and found the place
<>empty of the treasure. They accused each other of
<>stealing the treasure. Both of them complained to the
<>King. The King asked them whether they had any
<>witnesses and they replied that only the tree was there
<>as a witness. The King decided that both of them should
<>go beneath the same tree and dip their hands in burning
<>oil to prove their innocence. Dus2t2abuddhi went to his
<>father and requested him that he should hide in the
<>hollow of that tree and say that it was Dharmabuddhi
<>who had stolen the treasure. Hearing this the father
<>said “Child, when you think of a trick you must also
<>think of the danger involved in it. Once there lived a
<>stork with his wife on a tree. A serpent living in the same
<>tree began to eat the young ones of the stork and the
<>stork complained to his friend fox about it. The clever
<>fox suggested to him a plan. There was a mongoose
<>living near the tree. The stork was to drop fishes in
<>front of the hole of the mongoose and continue
<>dropping fishes in a line leading to the abode of the
<>serpent. The mongoose would thus be led to the hole
<>of the serpent. The stork did so and when the mongoose [Page557-b+ 65]
<>reached the hole of the serpent it saw it and killed it.
<>I cannot do such cruel things.” But when Dus2t2abuddhi
<>insisted, the father half-heartedly agreed to it and went
<>and sat in the hollow of the tree. Next day the servants
<>of the King came to the foot of the tree with burning
<>oil. They asked the tree to tell the truth regarding
<>the theft. Then there came a voice from the tree denounc-
<>ing Dharmabuddhi as the culprit. Dharmabuddhi then
<>said there was no truth in the bodiless voice and request-
<>ed them to fumigate the tree from beneath. The royal
<>servants did so and then the father came out and con-
<>fessed everything. The servants of the King nailed
<>Dus2t2abuddhi on a spike and killed him.
<NI>After having told the story Karat2aka tried to dissuade
<>his brother from his deceitful intentions. Karat2aka
<>said:--“Pin3gala and San5ji1vaka are kind-hearted and
<>simple people. There need be no treachery with them.
<>Treachery is allowed against wicked people. I shall tell
<>you the story of a merchant:--
<NI>This merchant had as his entire wealth a thousand
<>pounds of iron and one day he went on a pilgrimage
<>after entrusting his entire wealth to a friend and
<>neighbour of his on the understanding that the latter
<>should return it on his return after the pilgrimage.
<>After ten months the merchant returned but the friend
<>did not give back the iron. He regretted that all the
<>iron was eaten by rats in which his house abounded.
<>The merchant knew that his neighbour was speaking
<>falsehood but kept silent over the matter. After a few
<>days the merchant somehow enticed the only son of his
<>neighbour to his house and locked the young boy in a
<>room. The friend went in search of his son to the
<>merchant's house and asked him whether he had seen
<>his son anywhere. The merchant replied that he saw
<>the boy being carried away by a kite. The friend could
<>not believe the story and suspecting some foul play on
<>the part of the merchant went to the king and reported
<>the matter to him. The king sent for the merchant and
<>asked him about the missing boy. The merchant gave
<>the king the same reply he gave his friend. The king
<>was surprised and asked the merchant whether it was
<>believable that a boy aged eighteen would be carried
<>away by a kite. The merchant very coolly replied that
<>such things could happen in a country where rats could
<>eat a thousand pounds of iron. The king asked the
<>merchant to explain and he then told him everything
<>that had happened. The king ordered the friend to
<>return the iron and the merchant got back his wealth.
<>Karat2aka after telling this story added that deceit in
<>return for deceit was no sin. Damanaka stuck on to
<>his plan and made the lion and ox fight each other. The
<>poor ox was killed and the lion became his old self
<>again.
<NI>2) {%Suhr2lla1bha. (Gaining friends).%} Once there lived on
<>a tree a crow named Laghupatanaka. The crow saw a
<>hunter coming and spreading a net beneath the tree.
<>A flock of doves coming that way was caught in the net.
<>But the doves flew up in a body and the net was
<>carried from the ground freed of the pegs that held it.
<>The crow followed them and when they were safely
<>landed at another place Citragri1va the leader of the
<>doves, told the crow thus “I shall now show you the
<>benefit of gaining friends.” Citragri1va and his doves flew
<>again with the net and landed before the hole of a rat
<>named Hiran2yaka. The rat was a friend of Citragri1va. [Page558-a+ 65]
<>On hearing the voice of Citragri1va outside, Hiran2yaka
<>came out and felt sorry for the plight of the doves. The
<>rat pointed out that nobody could oppose fate and
<>proved it with illustrations. He added:--“Though
<>elephants and cobras are mightier and fiercer than men,
<>it is because of fate that they are being controlled by
<>smaller people than they themselves. Hiran2yaka cut
<>to pieces the threads of the net and set the doves free.
<>Next day the doves flew away to their places. Seeing
<>the generosity shown by the rat, the crow wanted to
<>be friendly with the rat. The crow mentioned this to
<>the rat. But the rat refused to be friendly thinking that
<>it was a ruse to get him killed for his food. But the
<>crow promised to be grateful for ever to the rat for
<>saving the doves which belonged to the community of
<>birds to which the crow also belonged. But the rat
<>retorted that gratitude was a quality which was absent
<>in any living being and generally harm was the reward
<>for any favour done. The crow was greatly grieved to
<>hear the words of Hiran2yaka and told him that he
<>(crow) would commit suicide if the rat did not take
<>him as his friend. At last the rat took pity on the
<>crow and they became friends. Time passed on and then
<>there broke out a famine in the land. The crow decided
<>to shift his abode and told the rat about it. He said
<>he was going to a lake on the banks of which lived a
<>friend of his, a tortoise. The tortoise, he added, would
<>fetch for him from the lake plenty of fish to eat. The
<>rat was also affected by the famine and so he also decid-
<>ed to accompany the crow. The crow took the rat
<>in its beak and they both reached the lake where lived
<>the tortoise named Manthara. The crow introduced
<>Hiran2yaka to the tortoise and the tortoise asked him
<>the reason why he left his previous abode.
<NI>The rat said:--“There was a bhiks2u (one who lives on
<>alms) named Cu1d2a1karn2a living in a house in my place.
<>He used to eat only what was required to maintain
<>life in him. He would cook his own food and keep the
<>remains everyday in his kitchen. I used to eat that
<>food and live. Then one day another Sannya1sin named
<>Br2hatsphik (Vi1n2a1karn2a) came to this house. Every
<>night Vi1n2a1karn2a used to read the Pura1n2as to Cu1da1-
<>karn2a. Cu1d2a1karn2a would sit and make a sound on the
<>bow kept nearby to drive me away. The first time he
<>did so Vi1n2a1karn2a who was reading resented the
<>interrupting sound and asked Cu1d2a1karn2a why he made
<>it. He then explained that it was intended to drive
<>away the rat coming to steal the food. I was forced to
<>starve and I became lean and weak. Even rivers would
<>go dry if there are no rains. Only those with wealth
<>would have friends. Begging is a nuisance to others.
<>Everywhere it is important to acquire good and faith-
<>ful friends. When a good man is in danger only good
<>men rush to help him. When an elephant falls into a
<>pit it is always another elephant which comes to its
<>rescue. Therefore I desire to make friends with you.”
<NI>All the three, the crow, the rat and the tortoise lived
<>together happily. Then one day a deer named Citra1n3-
<>gada escaping from a hunter came frightened to their
<>midst and started living with them. One day the deer
<>which went in search of food did not return even after
<>dusk and so the crow went in search of the deer and
<>found it trapped in a hunter's net. The crow informed
<>the rat about it and the rat immediately came and
<>started gnawing at the strings of the net. In the mean- [Page558-b+ 65]
<>time the tortoise desirous of knowing the plight of
<>Citra1n3gada crawled to the place of accident. The rat
<>had already torn to pieces the net and the crow and
<>the rat said that it was unwise of Manthara to have
<>come so far crawling as there was danger from the
<>hunter coming to the place soon. Before the deer
<>could endorse the views of his friends the hunter came
<>to the scene. The deer, the crow and the rat escaped.
<>The hunter saw the crawling tortoise and caught it.
<>Binding it with a string the hunter placed it on the
<>ground. In the meantime the friends of Manthara who
<>had escaped hit upon a plan to resuce the tortoise.
<>The deer lay down pretending to be dead at a place
<>far away from the place but within the sight of the
<>hunter. The crow sat perched on its body as if pecking
<>at its flesh. The hunter saw it and went to take the
<>dead body of the deer. The moment the hunter turned
<>away from the tortoise the rat went and cut the string
<>binding the tortoise and set it free. Before the hunter
<>reached the deer it ran away. So all were saved. This
<>is the benefit of having good friends.

<>There was once a big banyan tree in a forest which
<>was inhabited by many crows. Their leader was a
<>crow named Meghavarn2a About three kilometres away
<>from this tree was another banyan tree on which lived
<>a number of owls. Their leader was an owl named
<>Amardana. The crows and the owls were great

<NI>One day Amardana king of the owls with a large army
<>of a lakh of his subjects attacked the crows at night.
<>The crows could not see at night and so all the crows
<>excepting a few of the top ones were killed. Megha-
<>varn2a, the king, and his ministers, Uddi1paka, Sandi1paka,
<>Anudi1paka and Ciran5ji1vi1 and a few other subjects were
<>the only ones who escaped from there somehow. They
<>sat in council at a place and thought of the ways and
<>means to wreak vengeance on the owls. Uddi1paka said
<>that when the strength of the enemy was great it was
<>advisable to move away to another place, or to seek
<>the aid of mighty people or to surrender to the enemy.
<>It was the nature of dogs to leave one's place and go
<>to another place, Sandi1paka said. Others also were
<>of the same opinion. Ciran5ji1vi1 alone did not express
<>any opinion and so the king asked him why he was
<>sitting silent.
<NI>Ciran5ji1vi1 said:--“Oh King, we became enemies of
<>the owls because of our bad tongue. I shall tell you
<>the story of an ass which met with its death because of its
<>bad words. Once a washerman had a donkey to carry
<>his load of clothes to and fro. The poor washerman
<>did not have sufficient earnings to feed the donkey well
<>and so he let it loose to go and eat of its own accord to
<>appease its hunger. The donkey started going to the
<>fields of other people and eating their grains. People
<>started hurting the donkey and so the washerman did a
<>clever thing. He covered the donkey with the hide of
<>a tiger and let it loose. People mistook it for a tiger
<>and did not dare to go near and hurt it. Then one day
<>a farmer keeping watch over the fields at night felt
<>suspicious of the fake tiger and covering himself with a
<>blanket and with a bow and arrow in his hand stealthi-
<>ly approached the donkey. The poor donkey mistook
<>the farmer for a she-donkey and brayed and approached [Page559-a+ 64]
<>him with amorous movements of its body. The farmer
<>knew from its voice that it was a donkey and so
<>removed his disguise and stood before the donkey. The
<>be-fooled donkey got angry and abused the farmer
<>using very vulgar language. The farmer got angry and
<>killed him with an arrow.
<NI>Ciran5ji1vi1 continued:--Once upon a time a few birds
<>joined together and decided to elect their leader. The
<>owl was the bird selected to lead them. An aged crow
<>condemned it. The crow said; “Are you making this
<>ugly bird which is blind all day your leader? If only

<>respected. I shall tell you a story to illustrate my
<>point.” He then narrated the following story:
<NI>Once upon a time there came a period of twelve
<>continuous years without any rain at all on the earth.
<>Wells, ponds, lakes and rivers were all empty. A huge
<>herd of elephants walking in the forests represented to
<>its leader the grave situation and the leader sent
<>messengers to all sides to find out watering places with
<>water. One of the messengers came back and reported
<>that he had found out a beautiful lake full of water and
<>that on its banks lived a number of hares. The elephants
<>immediately went to that place and started enjoying
<>swimming and bathing in the waters of the lake.
<>Many rabbits on the bank of the lake died when trodden
<>upon by the elephants. The aggrieved rabbits sat in
<>a council to consider the steps to be taken to stop this
<>deadly nuisance of the elephants. One of the hares,
<>Vijaya by name, promised to handle the matter by
<>himself. He knew it would be unwise to go anywhere
<>near the elephants. So Vijaya climbed on to the top
<>of a hill near the lake and when he saw the elephants
<>coming to the lake as usual hailed them from the top
<>of the hillock. When the elephants turned their heads
<>to the place from where the sound came they saw a
<>hare speaking to them. The hare bawled out thus: “We
<>are all servants of Candra, the moon-god. This lake
<>has been given to us by him. Candra Bhagava1n has
<>deputed me to verify a report which has reached him
<>that some elephants are making the water of the lake
<>muddy. He will surely be cross with you if you again
<>enter the lake. So it is better for you to go away from
<>this place.” The elephants were frightened and they
<>all left the place. Ciran5ji1vi1 added that this happened
<>to the elephants because of the lack of a wise and
<>proper leader.
<NI>The aged Ciran5ji1vi1 continued: “It is unwise to place
<>confidence in small people. I had an experience. Near
<>my abode on a tree there lived a bird called Kapin5jala.
<>We became friends. One day Kapin5jala did not come
<>home as usual. Taking advantage of it a rabbit came
<>to Kapin5jala's abode and started living there. I did not
<>like it and I told the rabbit about it. But the rabbit
<>did not mind it. After four or five days Kapin5jala
<>returned home and on finding a rabbit in his nest got
<>angry and asked him to leave the place. The rabbit
<>refused to go and an argument ensued. The rabbit said
<>that lakes, rivers and trees were for all and did not
<>belong to any particular individual. “He who is in
<>possession of it is its owner,” the rabbit argued. So they
<>decided to take the case for arbitration and for that
<>purpose approached a cat named Dadhikarn2a doing
<>penance on the banks of the river Yamuna1, I followed [Page559-b+ 64]
<>them curious to know the decision of the ascetic cat.
<>They did not see me. Both of them on approaching
<>him started presenting their case before the cat. The
<>cat pretended to be deaf and asked both of them to
<>come nearer and talk into his ears. They moved
<>nearer and the cat caught hold of them both and ate
<>them. Those poor beings lost their lives by placing too
<>much confidence in the aged cat. That is why I say
<>that we should not select a small being like an owl as
<>our leader.
<NI>On hearing the story of the crow the birds withdrew
<>from their first decision of selecting an owl as their
<>leader. The owl was offended and felt insulted and
<>roared that his community would one day wreak
<>vengeance on the crows. A wound made by an arrow
<>would heal in due course and a tree would grow even
<>if its branches are cut but any wound on the pride of
<>an individual is never healed.
<NI>Ciran5ji1vi1 continued:--“This is how the crows and owls
<>became enemies. We have to fight the owls. It is im-
<>possible to serve mean people. I shall tell you a story
<>of what would happen if one believes in mean people:--
<>Once a brahmin decided to perform a Ya1ga to increase
<>the prosperity of the land.
<NI>He wanted a goat for the same and some
<>wicked young people knew that he was going to buy
<>one. They worked out a plan to deceive the poor
<>brahmin. They sat hiding at different places on the way
<>the brahmin was returning with the goat. As he came near
<>the first of the wicked young men accosted the brahmin
<>and asked him where he was taking the dog. The
<>brahmin was surprised that the young man mistook his
<>goat for dog and went his way. When he walked some
<>distance more the second of the group came to him and
<>put the same question. This time the brahmin was a
<>bit perplexed that two people should have put the same
<>question which he thought was absurd. When a third
<>man put this question again he became worried and
<>when this same question was repeated two more times
<>the brahmin got mad and left the goat on the road and
<>went his way. The wicked youngsters took the goat
<>cooked it and ate it.
<NI>After narrating several such stories and maxims Ciran5-
<>ji1vi1 said he would lead the owls into a trap and come
<>back. Ciran5ji1vi1 then went to the owls and their friends
<>on the top of R2s2yas4r2n3ga.
<NI>Ciran5ji1vi1 shaved his head and smearing the blood of the
<>dead crows on his body went and sat alone on a branch
<>of their former abode, the banyan tree. When night
<>came the owls came and surrounded the tree. Ciran5ji1vi1
<>made some pitiable groans and the owls took him before
<>their king. The king questioned Ciran5ji1vi1 and he said
<>thus:--
<NI>“I am Ciran5ji1vi1 the minister of Meghavarn2a. Once
<>I praised your greatness before my king and he
<>shaved my head and dismissed me from his service.” The
<>king of the owls asked his ministers what should be
<>done with Ciran5ji1vi1. The minister of the king of
<>owls, Baka, immediately jumped from his seat and said:
<NI>“Once a fox went to steal the cow of a brahmin. On his
<>way he met a Brahmara1ks2asa and they became friends.
<>The Brahmara1ks2asa was going to kill and eat the brah-
<>min. Both exchanged their ideas and when they reached
<>the gate of the house of the brahmin the fox said he [Page560-a+ 65]
<>would go first and eat the goat. But the Brahmara1ks2asa
<>said he would enter first and eat the brahmin. The
<>quarrel developed into a noisy one and hearing the
<>sound outside the brahmin came out. The fox accused
<>the Brahmara1ks2asa of having come to eat the brahmin
<>while the Brahmara1ks2asa accused the fox of having
<>come to eat the goat. The brahmin was glad that he
<>escaped from a danger and pardoning them sent them
<>both with presents. This is the benefit of a split
<>among the enemies.
<NI>The king of the owls gave refuge to Ciran5ji1vi1 and the
<>latter expressing gratitude for the favour done took a
<>vow that he would wreak vengeance on the crows after
<>getting himself born as an owl in his next birth. At
<>once the king said “Oh Ciran5ji1vi1, it is not wise to
<>change one's clan. Once a kite picked up a girl rat and
<>flew up. On the way the young rat slipped from the
<>beak of the kite and fell down into the open palm of a
<>sage doing his sandhya1vandana. The sage by his yogic
<>powers made it into a beautiful girl and presented her
<>to his wife. The girl attained womanhood and the sage
<>was anxious to get her married to a suitable person.
<>He first approached the Sun and the Sun replied “You
<>are in search of a powerful husband. Megha (cloud) is
<>more powerful than myself since at any time it can cast
<>a shadow over my brilliance. So go and ask Megha
<>about this.” The sage went to Megha and Megha said
<>that wind which could carry him away at his will was
<>more powerful than himself and so directed him to the
<>wind. The sage approached the wind and it said that
<>the mountain which could obstruct its path was more
<>powerful and so the sage went to the mountain. The
<>mountain said that the rat which could make holes in him
<>was more powerful and so finally the sage went to the
<>rat. The rat agreed to marry her but asked how it could
<>keep her in the hole which was his abode. The sage said
<>that it was easy and changed her into a rat. This is
<>how a girl rat became a girl rat again. So do not change
<>your clan, be a crow and live with me.”
<NI>Ciran5ji1vi1 from that day onwards started living with the
<>owls. During day time when the owls slept, the old crow
<>would fly hither and thither and collect such easily
<>combustible materials as hay, dry grass and cotton and
<>stock them beneath the tree covered with dry leaves.
<>Two months went by like this and one day when the
<>owls were sleeping Ciran5ji1vi1 set fire to the stock of dry
<>materials beneath the tree. The owls were all burnt to
<>death. Meghavarn2a and his friends congratulated Cir-
<>an5ji1vi1 on his success. Ciran5ji1vi1 said: To obtain difficult
<>positions great men pass through difficult situations. If
<>one is prepared to suffer hardships any object can be
<>achieved. Once a cobra began to starve for want of food.
<>It went to the land of frogs and told the king of frogs
<>thus: “Friend, I am in difficulties. I happened to bite
<>a brahmin boy and that boy died. The boy's father cursed
<>me. I asked for forgiveness and then he said:--“You
<>must carry your enemies, the frogs, on your back from
<>one pond to another pond and live on the food they
<>give you.” The king of the frogs believed him and
<>allowed his subjects to be carried away to another pond
<>from the one in which they were then staying. The
<>cobra ate all the frogs on the way and at last the king
<>also was eaten. Thus to destroy the enemies one will
<>have to carry them on one's backs sometimes. The crows
<>were happy their enemies the owls were destroyed and [Page560-b+ 65]
<>they lived more happily and peacefully than before.
<NI>4) {%Labdhana1s4a.. (Losing what you got).%} Once a monkey
<>named Bali1mukha separated himself from his group and
<>came to a fig tree on the banks of a river. When he
<>jumped from branch to branch on the tree a great many
<>ripe figs fell into the river. Seeing this a crocodile
<>named S4im3s4uma1ra came to the foot of the tree and
<>started eating the fruits. This went on for a few days
<>and then the crocodile and the monkey became good
<>friends. One day the crocodile sat chatting with the
<>monkey and eating fruits and did not go home. The
<>wife of the crocodile got worried on not seeing her
<>husband back at home and sent a maid of hers to
<>go and enquire what happened to her husband. The
<>maid came and reported that the crocodile was spending
<>his time with a she-monkey. The wife of the crocodile
<>was very sad and angry to hear this and she sent word
<>through her maid that she was seriously ill and if he
<>wanted to see her alive he must return to her immed-
<>iately. The crocodile returned home immediately and
<>he called a doctor to examine her. The doctor who had
<>been previously bribed by the crocodile's wife said that
<>she should be given the heart of a monkey if she were
<>to be saved from her present ailment. The crocodile was
<>in a fix. He weighed in his mind the lives of his wife
<>and friend and then decided to take the life of his friend
<>to save the life of his wife. The crocodile went to its
<>place near the fig tree as usual and the monkey made
<>enquiries about his family. Then S4im3s4uma1ra said that his
<>wife wanted to see the monkey-friend and had asked him
<>to take him home that day. The monkey believed the
<>story and started for the house of S4im3s4uma1ra on its
<>back. When they reached half way in the river S4im3s4u-
<>ma1ra told Bali1mukha thus: “My wife is seriously ill.
<>The doctor has prescribed the heart of a monkey as the
<>only medicine for it.” The monkey went pale-white with
<>fright but instantly he hit upon a plan. Bali1mukha said
<>“S4im3s4uma1ra, what a fool you are. Why did you not
<>tell me this at least at the time of our departure? I kept
<>my heart on the tree before starting, for I never knew
<>you were in need of it. Let us go back and take it.”
<>The poor crocodile believed the story and went back
<>with the monkey to the fig tree. As soon as they reach-
<>ed the shore the monkey jumped from the back
<>of the crocodile and ran to the tree. The crocodile
<>asked the monkey to bring his heart soon but the
<>monkey laughed from the top of the fig tree and said
<>thus:--“Dull-witted crocodile, I am not an ass like
<>you. Have you not heard the story of the foolish ass?”
<>The monkey then narrated the story of the ass thus:--
<>“Once a lion calling his minister, the fox, to his side said
<>that he wanted to eat the flesh of an ass as a remedy
<>for the stomach trouble he was having by drinking too
<>much of elephant's blood. The minister started in search
<>of an ass and found one in the house of a washerman.
<>The fox said that he was surprised that the ass was do-
<>ing such heavy work daily with a washerman when a
<>happy life in the palace of the lion was easily available.
<>The ass was tempted and it went to the den of the lion.
<>When it reached there it got frightened and taking the
<>opportunity of the absence of the lion for his evening
<>worship left the place in a hurry. The lion sent the fox
<>again to fetch the ass. The fox came and laughed at
<>the timidity of the ass. He said that the lion was of a
<>loving nature and last time when it approached the ass [Page561-a+ 64]
<>to embrace him out of affection he ran away like a fool.
<>The lion knew that the asses were as a class good music-
<>ians and the lion himself a great lover of music was
<>anxious to hear the ass sing. The poor ass believed the
<>story and went to the lion along with the fox When
<>the ass reached the lion's den the lion was waiting for
<>him and the ass in all simplicity bowed before the lion.
<>The lion with one stroke killed the poor beast and leav-
<>ing the carcass to the care of the fox went for his
<>Sandhya1vandana. When the lion returned the fox had
<>already eaten the heart of the ass. The King of the
<>beasts not finding the heart in its place questioned
<>the fox and the fox replied that the asses do not possess
<>either a heart or neck:
<NI>When the monkey concluded his story by adding that
<>never again would he be trapped like this, S4im3s4uma1ra,
<>the crocodile, went its way. Labdhana1s4a is the act of
<>losing what came into your possession once.
<NI>5) {%Asampreks2yaka1rita.%} This is a tale which explains
<>the danger behind doing things adventurously without
<>properly studying the pros and cons of an issue.
<NI>Once upon a time there lived in Gaud2ades4a a brahmin
<>named Devas4arma1. His wife Yajn5asena1 became
<>pregnant. The father started saying that the son to be
<>born would be a very fortunate boy. One day the
<>wife of the brahmin told him thus:--“It is not good to
<>build castles in the air. Once a brahmaca1ri1 walked
<>home carrying the fried grain he got as his daks2in2a1 in
<>a pot on his head. He started thinking thus--“I will
<>sell this fried grain and with the money will buy a
<>lamb. The lamb will grow and give birth to two kids.
<>I will then sell the goat and the kids and buy a cow.
<>The cow will give birth to calves in a short time. I
<>will buy some land to raise paddy. After selling the
<>paddy I will renovate my old house and then I will
<>marry. She will deliver a beautiful son. I will name
<>the child Somas4arma1. At times leaving the child
<>alone my wife will go to milk the cow and then I will
<>hit her like this.” So saying the brahmaca1ri1 hit with his
<>stick the mud pot on his head containing the fried
<>grain. The pot broke and the whole thing inside fell on
<>the road.
<NI>Devas4arma1 on hearing the story of Yajn5asena1 became
<>pensive. After five or six days Yajn5asena1 delivered a
<>son. Days went by and one morning Yajn5asena1 went
<>for her bath in the river nearby entrusting the child to
<>the care of her husband. Some moments later a
<>messenger came from the palace asking him to go over
<>there. The brahmin was in a fix. There was nobody
<>around to whose care he could leave the child. He
<>had a mongoose. The brahmin asked the mongoose to
<>look after the child and went to the palace. Some
<>time later a big cobra came creeping towards the
<>child. The mongoose jumped at it and killed it.
<>The mongoose was smeared with blood after that. The
<>brahmin returned hurriedly from the palace only to
<>see the blood-smeared mongoose waiting at the door-
<>step. Thinking that the mongoose must have killed
<>his son the brahmin thrashed the poor mongoose to
<>death. But on entering the room the brahmin found
<>out his mistake, for there near the child was the dead
<>body of a deadly cobra. The brahmin regretted his
<>foolish act of doing a deed before knowing things well,
<>when Yajn5asena1 came back after her bath and was [Page561-b+ 64]
<>greatly disturbed by the foolish deed of her husband.
<>She said:--“Once there was in a place a very poor
<>brahmin boy. He was an orphan with nobody to help
<>him and he suffered from hunger daily. One night
<>the boy had a dream. He was told that at midday
<>next day three beggars would come to his place and
<>if he slew them they would turn themselves into trea-
<>sure jars and that the boy could become rich by
<>using the wealth so received. Next day the brahmin
<>boy was having his head shaved when as predicted in
<>the dream three beggars entered his house. The
<>brahmin boy ran away from the barber and taking a
<>stick thrashed the three to death. All the three turned
<>into treasure jars. The barber was astonished. The
<>brahmin boy gave the barber a sovereign taken from
<>the jar as his wages. The barber thought that beggars
<>would turn themselves into treasure jars if they were
<>thrashed to death. So he waited daily in his house
<>for beggars to enter his house. One day after a long
<>waiting three beggars entered his house and the barber
<>with a hard stick which he had kept ready started
<>thrashing the beggars. The beggars shrieked and
<>shouted and ran away abusing the barber. Servants of
<>the King came on hearing this and took the barber
<>away and by the command of the King killed him
<>nailing him on to a spike. Yajn5asena1 concluded by
<>saying that even death would be the result if one does
<>anything without properly understanding things.

<NI>Pan5cavat2i1 is on the southern bank of the Goda1vari1.
<>Five Vat2avr2ks2as (banyan trees) stand here in a circle
<>and therefore, the place got the name Pan5cavat2i1. There
<>is a legend about these banyan trees. Once five Gan-
<>dharva youths encircled the sage Agastya in the forest
<>as a sport and prevented him from moving towards any
<>direction. The enraged sage cursed them to stand in
<>the same position as banyan trees. Thus by obstructing
<>the movements of a divine man they were forced to
<>remain without movement as trees. Before they took
<>the form of trees they begged the sage for deliverance
<>from the curse. Agastya said, “One day S4ri Ra1ma with
<>his wife and brother will come and stay in an a1s4rama
<>built in your midst. Their holy presence will give
<>you salvation from my curse.”
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma and Laks2man2a when they came to that

<>started to build the hermitage. At first he cut down one
<>of the trees standing tall and straight and to the
<>surprise and astonishment of all the fallen trunk of the
<>tree disappeared and there in its place lay the dead [Page562-a+ 64]
<>body of a demon youth. It was the body of S4ambhu-
<>kuma1ra, son of S4u1rpan2akha1. He was doing penance
<>there when S4ri1 Ra1ma came there with Si1ta1 and becom-
<>ing lustful at the sight of Si1ta1 he stood there as a tree.
<>It was he who was cut down by Laks2man2a.
<NI>S4ri1 Ra1ma understood the thing that happened. He
<>then explained to Si1ta1 and Laks2man2a many things

<HI>PA1N2D2AVAS.
<NI>1) {%Origin.%} S4antanu, a celebrated King of Candravam3s4a
<>(lunar dynasty) had two wives, Gan3ga1 and Satyavati1.
<>Bhi1s2ma was the son of Gan3ga1. After the birth of Bhi1s2ma
<>Gan3ga1 his mother went to heaven. After that S4antanu
<>married Satyavati1, mother of Vya1sa. Satyavati1 got two
<>sons, Citra1n3gada and Vicitravi1rya. Even while a
<>bachelor, Citra1n3gada was killed by a Gandharva of
<>the same name. So Vicitravi1rya became King on
<>S4antanu's death. Bhi1s2ma forcibly brought the three
<>daughters of the King of Ka1s4i1 named Amba1, Ambika1
<>and Amba1lika1 for Vicitravi1rya to marry. But knowing
<>that Amba1 was in love with the King of Sa1lva, Bhi1s2ma
<>let her off on the way. Ambika1 and Amba1lika1 became
<>the wives of Vicitravi1rya. But for a long time they had
<>no sons.
<NI>At that time Satyavati1, mother of Vicitravi1rya, sent
<>for Vya1sa her eldest son and asked him to beget sons
<>of Ambika1 and Amba1lika1. Ambika1 got Dhr2tara1s2t2ra of
<>Vya1sa and Amba1lika1, Pa1n2d2u, father of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra was born blind and he married Ga1ndha1ri1.
<>Pa1n2d2u was born pale-white in colour and he married
<>Kunti1 mother of the Pa1n2d2avas.
<NI>Kunti1 was the sister of Vasudeva, father of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a.
<>The real name of Kunti1 was Pr2tha1. S4u1rasena, King of
<>the Ya1davas, was the father of Kunti1 and Vasudeva.
<>Because Kuntibhoja son of Su1rasena's sister, had no
<>issues Kunti1 was sent to the palace of Kuntibhoja and
<>she grew up there. Pr2tha1 got the name of Kunti1 be-
<>cause of that. Besides Kunti1, Pa1n2d2u had another wife
<>named Ma1dri1. [Page562-b+ 64]
<NI>While she was living in the palace of Kuntibhoja the
<>sage Durva1sas came and stayed in the palace as the
<>king's guest. Kunti1 was a little girl then and yet she
<>served the sage with such care, patience and devo-
<>tion that the sage was greatly pleased with her and gave
<>her a divine mantra. He said: “If you call upon any
<>god repeating this mantra he will manifest himself to
<>you and bless you with a son equal to him in glory and
<>valour. You can use this only five times.” The impa-
<>tient curiosity of youth made Kunti1 give a test to the
<>power of the mantra and though unmarried she invoked
<>the Sun. The Sun immediately presented himself be-
<>fore her and by his grace she conceived and got a son
<>whom she secretly set afloat in a river. A childless
<>charioteer named Adhiratha happened to see the child
<>and he took it home and brought it up. When he grew
<>up he was sent to Hastina1pura and the sons of Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra took him in their service. He was Karn2a, the
<>celebrated warrior of the Kauravas. Kunti1 married
<>Pa1n2d2u after the birth of Karn2a.
<NI>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra got of Ga1ndha1ri1 a hundred sons and a
<>daughter named Dus4s4ala1. The children of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra
<>were known as Kauravas or Dha1rtara1s2t2ras. Pa1n2d2u had
<>a curse that he would die the moment he entered
<>into sexual sport with his wives. (See under Kindama).
<>So under instructions from her husband Kunti1 invoked
<>Dharma, Va1yu and Indra and got the sons Yudhis2t2hira,
<>Bhi1masena and Arjuna. She gave the remaining one
<>chance to Ma1dri1 and Ma1dri1 invoked the two As4vini1-
<>devas, Na1satya and Dasra and got two sons named
<>Nakula and Sahadeva. All these five were accepted as
<>the sons of Pa1n2d2u and so they got the name of
<>Pa1n2d2avas. (Upto Chapter 123, A1di Parva).
<NI>2) {%Life in Hastina1pura and the lac-palace incident.%} After the
<>birth of the Pa1n2d2avas, Pa1n2d2u with his wife and child-
<>ren spent a very long time in the forest of S4atas4r2n3ga.
<>Kas4yapa, the royal priest of Vasudeva, performed the
<>Upanayana (investiture with the sacred thread) and
<>such other religious ceremonies ordained for boyhood.
<>They were educated under the sage S4uka. One day in
<>the Spring season Pa1n2d2u's resolution broke down
<>under the exhilarating influence of the season and he
<>caught hold of Ma1dri1 and embraced her despite ear-
<>nest and repeated protests from Ma1dri1. At once
<>the curse of the sage took effect and Pa1n2d2u fell
<>dead. It was the custom then that the wife should end
<>her life in the funeral pyre of her husband and so
<>Kunti1 and Ma1dri1 came forward to do so. But Ma1dri1
<>said that one of them should live to take care of the
<>children and so entrusting her children also to the care
<>of Kunti1, Ma1dri1 jumped into the funeral pyre and
<>ended her life. The sages of the S4atas4r2n3ga forest took
<>the children and Kunti1 to Hastina1pura and handing
<>them over to the charge of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra came back.

<>Kauravas. But there was no real affection or intimacy
<>between them. The naturally strong Bhi1ma found it a
<>sport to tease and torment the Kauravas whenever he
<>got an opportunity. Gradually as the teasings of Bhi1ma
<>became unbearable a wicked thought of somehow put-
<>ting an end to Bhi1ma's life found place in the minds
<>of the Kauravas. They once poisoned Bhi1ma and bind-
<>ing him tight with ropes threw him into the ocean. But
<>Bhi1ma went to the world of the Na1gas and came back [Page563-a+ 65]
<>unscathed with added siddhis (acquired power). This
<>annoyed the Kauravas.
<NI>It was at this time that Dron2a a renowned preceptor
<>in archery, came to Hastina1pura. Bhi1s2ma enrolled the
<>Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas as disciples of Dron2a. Arjuna
<>became an extraordinarily brilliant bow-man. This came
<>off as another reason for the Kauravas to drift away
<>from the Pa1n2d2avas. After the end of their course of
<>education a contest was held in which Arjuna ranked
<>first. The time came for Gurudaks2in2 (fees paid in
<>bulk at the end of the studies to a preceptor). Dron2a
<>asked his disciples to bring king Drupada bound hand
<>and foot before him. The Kauravas failed in that
<>mission and the Pa1n2d2avas under the leadership of
<>Arjuna fulfilled the demand of their Guru.
<NI>When the training and Gurudaks2in2a1 were over, Dhr2ta-
<>ra1s2t2ra crowned Yudhis2t2hira as the heir-apparent and
<>this increased the power and status of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>in Hastina1pura. The jealousy of Duryodhana knew no
<>bounds when he found the Pa1n2d2avas in the pinnacle of
<>power and popularity. He decided to kill them. He
<>therefore, built a new palace in a place called Va1ran2a1-
<>vata and with the permission of Dhr2tara1s2t2ra made
<>them change their residence to the new building.
<>The new building was cunningly built of lac and
<>other combustible material. The wise and intelligent
<>Vidura knew this deceit beforehand and so he had
<>warned the Pa1n2d2avas of the danger through a messen-
<>ger named Khanaka. The Pa1n2d2avas had, therefore,
<>made ready a secret passage by underground to es-
<>cape from the building when an emergency arose. The
<>passage was to lead them from the palace to the forest
<>nearby. One night Purocana, a minister of Duryodhana,
<>came stealthily and set fire to the palace. The Pa1n2d2avas
<>with their mother Kunti1 escaped from the palace to the
<>forest nearby. That night a huntress and her five sons
<>were sleeping in a part of the building and they were
<>burnt to death. They were all sleeping fully drunk and
<>so could not escape from the building. Purocana also
<>was burnt to death. Thus the Pa1n2d2avas had to go
<>away from Hastina1pura for a brief period.
<NI>3) {%The Exile and its end.%} The Kauravas thought that
<>Pa1n2d2avas died in the fire and in that belief conducted
<>the funeral rites of their brothers. The Pa1n2d2avas after
<>their escape from the fire walked a long distance
<>through the forests and came to the banks of the river
<>Gan3ga1. On their way a demon named Hid2imba attack-
<>ed them and Bhi1ma killed him but at the request of
<>Dharmaputra married his sister Hid2imbi1. After that
<>while they were continuing their journey crossing the
<>river a Gandharva of name Citraratha attacked them.
<>Citraratha was defeated in a battle and he later became
<>friendly with the Pa1n2d2avas. He gave them many valuable
<>presents and also narrated to them the story of Tapati1-
<>sam3varan2a. Then they went and stayed in the house of
<>a brahmin in the village of Ekacakra1. It was at that
<>time that the Svayam3vara of Pa1n5ca1li1 was held. The
<>Pa1n2d2avas went for the Svayam3vara and married
<>Pa1n5ca1li1. The news then spread that Pa1n2d2avas were not
<>dead but still alive. Dhr2tara1s2t2ra then sent for them and
<>the Pa1n2d2avas returned to their palace in Hastina1pura.
<>Yudhis2t2hira was crowned as King of half of the country
<>and he built his palace in a place known as Kha1n2d2ava-
<>prastha. The palace was designed and built by a demon
<>named Maya with beautiful Crystals and costly diamonds. [Page563-b+ 65]
<>When the Pa1n2d2avas were living there Na1rada
<>went to them once. He suggested that Pa1n5ca1li1 should
<>remain as wife to the Pa1n2d2avas in turn, one year each
<>to one of them. They accepted the suggestion and
<>started living like that. Yudhis2t2hira married Devika1,
<>daughter of King S4ibi, also. (S4loka 70, Chapter 95, A1di
<>Parva). Bhi1masena and Arjuna with the help of S4ri1
<>Kr2s2n2a slew Jara1sandha. After that they conducted a
<>victory march over the country and established their
<>overlordship by conducting successfully a Ra1jasu1ya yajn5a.
<>Duryodhana and his brothers once visited Indraprastha,
<>the palace of the Pa1n2d2avas. They were fooled at the
<>palace and this enraged them. Duryodhana invited
<>Dharmaputra for a game of dice and the latter lost
<>everything. Yet Dhr2tara1s2t2ra gave them back everything
<>and sent them to Indraprastha again. Before Dharma-
<>putra reached the palace Duryodhana once again
<>challenged him for a game of dice. Despite protesis
<>from all sides Dharmaputra went and played and lost
<>again everything. To fulfil the conditions of the game
<>Yudhis2t2hira went to the forests with his brothers and
<>wife to spend twelve years in exile and a year incog-
<>nito. At that time Kunti1 lived with Vidura.
<NI>It was during this period of exile that the Pa1n2d2avas
<>got the Aks2ayapa1tra (never-empty pot) from the Sun.
<>They dwelt first in Dvaitavana and then in Ka1mya-
<>kavana. Then they went to the mountain of Gandha-
<>ma1dana and from there to Badarika1s4rama. From
<>there they came back again to Ka1myakavana and
<>while they were living there Duryodhana and his men
<>went to that forest to see the sufferings of the Pa1n2d2avas
<>and gloat on their sad plight. But Citrasena, a Gan-
<>dharva, captured Duryodhana and Arjuna got him
<>released. Duryodhana sent Durva1sas to tease Dharma-
<>putra but the sage was sent back after being received
<>duly and well-attended to earn his blessings. During
<>their stay in that forest Jayadratha kidnapped Pa1n5ca1li1
<>but the Pa1n2d2avas rescued her immediately. They went
<>from there again to Dvaitavana. Dharmadeva tested
<>them once while they were there. The twelve years of
<>exile came to an end and as per directions from Dharma-
<>deva they spent their incognito period of one year in
<>the court of the King of Vira1t2a. After the end of their
<>incognito life the King of Vira1t2a gave in marriage his
<>daughter Uttara1 to Abhimanyu son of Arjuna.
<NI>Even after the return of the Pa1n2d2avas from the
<>forests after successfully fulfilling the conditions of the
<>game, Duryodhana showed obstinate reluctance to part
<>with even five pin-points of land in favour of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas. A peace mission of S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a from the
<>Pa1n2d2avas to avoid a war and settle matters amicably to
<>Dhr2tara1s2t2ra failed and the stage was set for a grea
<>battle between the Pa1n2d2avas and the Kauravas.
<NI>4) {%Ascension to Heaven.%} A great and grim battle was
<>fought at Kuruks2etra between the Pa1n2d2avas and the
<>Kauravas lasting for eighteen days. S4ri1 Kr2s2n2a neither
<>fought nor took arms even once against the Kauravas
<>but acted as the charioteer of Arjuna. When the war
<>came to an end the Kauravas were completely annihil-
<>ated.
<NI>Yudhis2t2hira became King. He performed an As4va-
<>medha Ya1ga. After a few years of reign the Pa1n2d2avas
<>crowned Pari1ks2it, son of Abhimanyu, as the King and
<>started for their Maha1prastha1na (departing this life).
<>They walked in a line in the order of their age, [Page564-a+ 64]
<>Dharmaputra leading and Pa1n5ca1li1 following last. At
<>first Pa1n5ca1li1 fell dead, but nobody turned back. Then
<>Sahadeva fell and nobody worried. This continued
<>thus till Dharmaputra was left alone. A dog which
<>followed them from their very start also remained
<>alive with Dharmaputra. The dog was none other than
<>Dharmadeva, father of Dharmaputra. When Dharma-
<>putra reached the top of the Hima1layas Indra was there
<>ready with the divine car to take him to heaven. But Dhar-
<>maputra said that he would not come to heaven leaving
<>his brothers and wife elsewhere. Then Indra informed
<>him that they were already in heaven and so Dharma-
<>putra went to heaven with Indra. (Only a general and
<>succinct history of the Pa1n2d2avas is given under this
<>head. For details see under the heads of each of the
<>Pa1n2d2avas as well as Pa1n5ca1li1, Kunti1, Bhi1s2ma and
<>Vya1sa).
